"Some people are focused on daily tasks while others are focused on their goals and how to achieve them. I've found these differences to be quite similar to the differences between people who are intuitive vs. sensing. Those who tend to focus on goals and ""visualize"" best can see the big pictures over time and are also more likely to make meaningful changes and anticipate future events. These goal-oriented people can step back from the day-to-day and reflect on what and how they're doing. They are the most suitable for creating new things (organizations, projects, etc.) and managing organizations that have lots of change. They typically make the most visionary leaders because of their ability to take a broad view and see the whole picture.In contrast, those who tend to focus on daily tasks are better at managing things that don't change much or that require processes to be completed reliably. Task-oriented people tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists. They are slower to depart from the status quo and more likely to be blindsided by sudden events. On the other hand, they're typically more reliable. Although it may seem that their focus is narrower than higher-level thinkers, the roles they play are no less critical. I would never have gotten Principles: Life & Work out or accomplished hardly anything else worthwhile if I didn't work with people who are wonderful at taking care of details. hashtag#principleoftheday",Not AI or Machine Learning,0,0

Those words made me flash back immediately to internal medicine residency, when that was one of my attendings favourite catchphrase. As a senior resident, it taught me accountability and responsibility, and the importance of thinking two steps ahead. In the hospital, it is easier for the team to rally around right thing to do - which is to get the patient feeling better and discharged.

In the informatics world (and upper levels of administration in general), we sometimes lose sight of the patient as the point of singular focus. Its the budget, or team resources, or personal reputation, or political capital, or many other competing priorities.

"Do you have enough compute power to progress your AI ambition with GPUs?GPUs (Graphics Processing Units, from companies such as Nvidia) are essential for advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to their unique architecture that excels at the kind of computations needed for training complex AI models. GPUs provide a significant speed boost for AI compared to CPUs. This allows researchers to train more complex models in shorter timeframes, leading to faster progress in AI development.Parallel Processing Power: Unlike CPUs (Central Processing Units) with a few cores optimized for sequential tasks, GPUs have thousands of cores. This allows them to handle many calculations simultaneously, which is crucial for training AI models that involve massive amounts of data and complex mathematical operations.Efficiency for Specific Tasks: GPUs are designed for processing graphics, which involves manipulating large datasets of pixels. This translates well to AI tasks that also deal with vast datasets, such as image recognition or natural language processing.Memory Bandwidth Advantage: GPUs boast high memory bandwidth, meaning they can transfer large amounts of data quickly between the processor and memory. This is essential for AI models that constantly access and process big datasets during training.",AI or Machine Learning,1,1

Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity. Organizations are implementing measures like acceptable tool lists, usage tracking, and effective communication around risk.-The application of GenAI in content generation demands clearer legal and regulatory guidance. Some organizations have airtight governance processes to ensure the responsible utilization of their AI tools.-While there are common risk factors across internal applications and customer-facing applications, there are additional concerns regarding the associated risks with customer-facing applications, particularly in safety-critical industries.-Future topics for discussion will include customizing and securing OpenAI chat interfaces, the complexities of data security, ensuring employee familiarity with administrative protocols, and optimizing OpenAI API usage.We look forward to reconvening next month.

"Meet Yulia Miller, St. Jude's pioneering lead Cultural Navigator in the Department of Social Work. This role was created as part of the SAFER Ukraine initiative in 2022 to bridge the gap in providing needed cultural support and care outside the hospital walls. As a native of Ukraine and a former interpreter for St. Jude, Miller was in a unique position to guide patient families through American customs and provide vital support during their time in Memphis. This included helping caregivers get a driver's license or going with family members to a doctor's appointment. On this International Women's Day, we celebrate Yulia Miller and her dedication in guiding international patient families at St. Jude. The work of the Social Work team not only fosters cultural understanding by leading with empathy but highlights the contributions of women's roles in healthcare. To alleviate some of the stresses of navigating a new city, Miller welcomes families upon their arrival, helps familiarize them with housing, and offers resources to ease in their transition. No matter how long she is with them she emphasizes that she is always available to help. In her role, Miller empowers families to participate in their child's care by fostering open communication and trust with providers as part of the St. Jude standard practice. In many international cultures, it is forbidden to question your doctor's opinion and ask questions. Here at St. Jude, we encourage families to interact in their child's care and feel empowered to ask questions.

"Extraordinary half-day wow session with our partners from Microsoft. Ninety (90) highly-motivated DC Water employees were at full attention as they learned more about Generative AI, CoPilot, Azure Open AI, Microsoft Dynamics, etc. Highly relevant use cases were shared, including a live Build and Demo of Copilot Studio and a Fire Hydrant Inspection App. Thoughts and ideas percolated throughout the room.

I, for one, am amazed by what this advanced technology can do to make us water utility professionals more productive, efficient, accurate, and capable of doing things never done before. Trusted data sources, no and low code software, and AI-imbedded technologies coming together with meaningful impact. 

My hats off to Kimberly Hoffman, Dave Bailey, Matt P., and Dionte W., among others from Microsoft. And, of course, Dolly Gada for all she does to keep me on track. : ) Last but not least, starting with Joe Edwards, my follow colleagues at #DCWater who inspire me by their desire to discover, learn, and promote positive change at one of the most advanced water utilities in the world.

"Amongst my personal values, fairness is probably the one I feel most strongly about. But is the game really fair? Not yet. But when we all do our part, I personally believe it can and will be. And there are inspiring examples. One comes from the company I joined two years ago: During my interview process, my son fell sick at home and had a crisis right in the middle of my third Zoom interview. I remember feeling like I had blown my chance at the job. However, my interview partner surprised me by showing understanding. She explained that one of the company's core values is being open and true to ourselves, acknowledging that being a parent doesn't stop when work begins. She kindly offered to reschedule, but I requested a couple of minutes to calm my son (and myself) before continuing the interview. That moment of support stuck with me throughout the process, and when I was offered the job, it was one of the reasons I said yes. The company I'm proud to be a part of is Logitech.Thinking about this experience recently, it reminded me about the pivotal role culture plays in creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed, included, and valued  where all people get a fair chance to truly flourish. I feel this way about Logitech's culture. At the heart of it - like for any culture -are its people. It's up to all of us to inspire inclusion and ensure that no one feels left out. Individually and collectively as teams, allies, ERGs etc. If you want to drive change, you need to take action. Every small step counts. As the saying goes, ""If you are not actively including, you might be accidentally excluding."" Let's support, uplift, and empower one another, not just today, but every day.

"TIS THE SEASON...In the fall of 1989, I was given an other fun assignment from my client at WB.Cut the trailer for another National Lampoon's Vacation movie.I had cut the previous one, so i was really looking forward to it.Because there were only four or five trailer companies at the time ( imagine that !), the editors had to cut everything. No one really had one specialty, we had to know how to cut every genre and I actually really enjoyed cutting comedy trailers quite a lot, because it was so different.There was also no double vending,( imagine that!), so the client worked with you until they got what they wanted and that made the collaboration special.We were in the trenches together.This was my 8th collaboration with John Hughes, who actually wrote all the National Lampoon Vacation movies.Even though John was just the writer on the movie, he was the producer and everything went thru him.For some reason, I couldn't use the famous Lindsey Buckingham song i had used in the previous trailer I had cut ( European Vacation ), so I had a composer give me something that sounded similar.The movie was as funny and outrageous as the other ones, so I had a blast cutting the trailer.We had the brilliant Percy Rodriguez read the copy for us and it took a few takes to finally get it without laughing.The film performed well at the box office, grossing $73.3 million against a $25 million budget  and it is now regarded as a Christmas classic.Merry Christmas everyone!!",Not AI or Machine Learning,0,0
"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work. To Raghuveer ., Atmaja Apsangi, Sumit Agrawal, Sombir Kadian, I extend my gratitude for fostering the Shark Idea Tank platform, a catalyst that expedited my innovation journey and exposed me to a realm of other ground-breaking ideas.

"After several months of boring through product development along with the wonderful team at samvid.ai , here is what I can say for sure about building enterprise AI using LLMs. 

1. LLMs are probabilistic beasts and although very powerful, should not be exposed directly to any enterprise user without adequate expertise layers between them. This is our #sootras and #neeyums framework.

2. Building this expertise layer requires all skill sets, not only an understanding of how LLMs work but also classical ML and strong software engineering skills. Yes, the death of software engineering is nowhere in sight. Dont let Devin fool you.

3. Scalability is a real issue. We can all feel excited about long context windows but neither that nor classical RAG will protect you from the stress of spiraling API costs. At samvid.ai , we have achieved success in resolving this issue through our concept of #essence repositories backed up by our #sootras and #neeyums 

Dont buy into the gimmicks of using an LLM out of the box, the end of software engineering or long context windows. Chasing those gimmicks can be fatal.

"We had the privilege of spending the day immersed in the world of data economics with the Dean of Big Data himself Bill Schmarzo. To say we learned a lot is an understatement. Some key takeaways:1. It's not about being data driven, it's about being value driven.2. Design thinking and data science are 2 sides of the same coin. By applying design thinking methodologies, such as empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration, organizations can develop data-driven solutions that truly resonate with users and deliver value.3. Focus on 10% of your data that has 90% of the value. When breaking down business problems into desired outcomes and KPI's, you will start to notice the same KPI's coming up over and over again. Focus on those KPI's.4. AI initiatives need to start small and address a real business problem. 5. Let your voice be heard as the world of AI evolves. It's not too late to affect change.

"AlphaFold-3 is out! What's new is that AlphaFold-3 uses diffusion to ""render"" the molecular structure. It starts from a fuzzy cloud of atoms and then materializes the molecule gradually through denoising. We live on a timeline where learnings from Llama and Sora can inform and accelerate life sciences. 

I find this level of generality absolutely mind-boggling. The same transformer+diffusion backbone that generates fancy pixels can also imagine proteins, as long as you convert the data to sequences of floats accordingly.

We are not there yet at a single AGI model, but we have successfully built a menu of general-purpose AI recipes that transfer training techniques, data pipelines, and neural architectures across domains that don't seem related. This should not work, but thank god it does!

"Greek philosopher Heraclitus is often tagged as the person who said that ""the only thing constant is change"". 

Change is on my mind lately in different actual sales cycles, circumstances, combinations and permutations as I am getting more heavily involved in AI, ML and ML Ops. 

If you think about AI as a definitive enabling disruption of our time, change management should be top of mind and a priority consideration.

Last week, I managed to visit Workz A/S (a premiere Change Management company) in Copenhagen and through the kindness of my good friend Edoardo Montenegro, I was able to learn more about change management by actually playing one of their very popular strategy board games called hashtag #WallBreakers. This game is a simulation of a merger and acquisition situation of 2 tech companies navigating the difficult task of change, post merger. Thank you also Ask Agger.

5 IMPORTANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Change is hard and complex. Know the WHYs of the change.
2. Sequence and speed of change matters. 
3. Know the players and catalysts of change. 
4. You cannot force change but you can manage & empower it. 
 Start with small strategic wins.
5. Get professional help and an actual playbook.

As I like numbers, I am appreciative of thought leaders like Greg Satell who also writes about change and recently wrote about how a minority in an organisation 25% can be a tipping point number to actually effect organizational change (actual article in the comments below).

AI will be part of every organisation. If you don't have a game plan change management strategy, you will likely have a lot of challenges. 

If you are all in AI instead of just experimenting and ""tinkering"", think about the strategy and how to win over the 25% as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

As change management is a ""human-centered"" practice, we have to really lean into the human side even if the intervention is enabling technology.''

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:Y Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. Y Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. YZ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. Yi  Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) Y Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology",AI or Machine Learning,1,1

Great to attend the National Flood Insurance Program FEMA Conference to understand flood risk to every property, how to make properties and communities more resilient and how to leverage AI to help achieve these goals.

At CoreLogic we leverage AI to innovate ...

Where every property attribute counts like first floor height (a major contributor to understanding flood risk in relation to the topology of the adjacent land)...

Where every pixel counts - where we use image analytics to identify wildfire resiliency factors on properties in California to reduce wildfire insurance premiums by up to 20% (e.g factors like fence is 12 feet away, no flammable materials within 5 feet and identifying enclosed roof eaves)

Where every property counts - use supercomputing to understand the financial risk to every property due to climate change ... initially up the year 2050 - enables regulators to shape policy, investors/lenders assess risk, insurers price premiums and set resilency factors to reduce premiums.

"Meta AI just dropped EmuVideo, generating 4-second short videos at 512x512 resolution and 16 FPS. Idea is quite straightforward: text -> image first, then do a ""super-resolution"" of the image along the temporal axis to synthesize motion.Long-form videos, however, are still out of reach. I see short videos as a kind of ""system 1 thinking"": you don't need much reasoning to generate 4 seconds. But system-2 type video generation needs coherence, long-term memory, and much higher computational cost.Regardless, EmuVideo is still a big upgrade on the video diffusion quality.

Firstly, they underscore the necessity for AI datacenter reference designs, with companies like Schneider Electric leading the way. Secondly, these articles shed light on the challenges posed by our aging infrastructure. Lastly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) forecasts that AI's evolution will disrupt 85 million jobs globally by 2025 while creating 97 million new roles.This transformative shift has significantly altered power demand dynamics, necessitating datacenter infrastructure capable of accommodating ever-expanding compute loads. As AI data centers consume a larger share of electricity, our aging power grid faces vulnerabilities, with 70% of its components over 25 years old. This underscores the emergence of non-tech AI investment opportunities, particularly in sectors such as power providers and datacenter infrastructure, where upgrades are essential to meet the demands of the digital age.

"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
-  Gets trigged from a new hire event
-  Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-   Reasons over data to answer employee questions 
-  Recommends personalized training based on employee background 

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- Orchestration of complex tasks. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks. 
- Memory and context. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time. 
- Monitoring and improving. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks. 
- Delegation with confidence and guardrails. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls. 

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview. 
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

"Thoma Bravo's Annual Meeting wrapped up last week in Miami and it's always a great opportunity to share perspectives with our LPs and answer probing questions that investors rightly ask, as we together aim to make sense of an extraordinarily complicated  and incredibly interesting  business environment in 2024 and beyond.  I gave a detailed presentation on the state of the software market as we see it today. Sharing here a couple of charts from that presentation that to me encapsulate the core of our firm's investment thesis and distinctive value proposition.  In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market  now in its third decade  continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital  particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.",AI or Machine Learning,1,1

" Im excited to announce what weve been working on for the last few months: the creation of Yuna, an AI and storytelling startup, and our $1.6 million dollar pre-seed round  

So whats the story? 

The sobering reality is that the magic of reading books is slowly being replaced by other forms of media. Each successive generation is enjoying fewer of the well known benefits that come with getting lost in a wonderful book (cognitive development, creativity, empathy, to name but a few).

What if we could reverse this trend? What if we could find a way to make reading just as engaging as watching Netflix, and eventually the 1st entertainment choice for children?

And so we wrote Yuna into existence. By combining AI with the enchantment of human creativity, Yuna writes books that are so personalised and interactive that they can be as engaging as any modern media platforms. Leveraging AI to empower writers, illustrators and publishers, Yuna imagines new forms of storytelling:

 Imagine a book that every night writes the next chapter of a personalised adventure involving you, your daughter and dog, weaving your familys interests into the narrative.

 Imagine a book that invites your niece to enter Hogwarts as a 1st year student and experience their own unique story through the wizarding world.

 Imagine a book that helps you discuss difficult topics with your son but in the form of an imaginary tale with him and his favourite character Snoopy. 

Over time, we hope to make these dreams come true, all with a singular goal: to ensure that children build a healthy reading habit for life.

Thanks to the hard work of the incredible Yuna team, weve been testing early versions of these ideas. Over the past 5 months, Yuna has written 100,000+ unique stories to 20,000 monthly active users. And we are growing fast - we expect to write the next 100,000 books within a few weeks of this announcement. Thank you Yuna team - you are truly epic.

A massive thank you to the partners involved in our $1.6M pre-seed round: Canary who led and who have been incredible every day since (special shoutout to Florian Hagenbuch who has been a believer and mentor from day -1); The Positive Ventures team and angel investors who followed the round and recognised Yunas potential to make a positive impact on the world (thank you especially to Fabio Kestenbaum!). Finally - Taahir Munshi, Pedro Sonego de Oliveira, Flora Oliveira, Fabian Wikstrom and Carolina Guimaraes, who played pivotal roles in turning Yuna from distant dream to reality during those early days. 

Now what?

Today, we are launching our beta test product in Brazil in Portuguese. If you are in Brazil, please give it a shot (see link in comments). If you are not, Yuna isnt available to test just yet, but fear not! Yuna is bringing its vision to the  very soon.

"AI-powered Credit Cards?! (Concept)

Imagine an AI-powered credit card with augmented reality (AR) that displays your balance and other stats when you hold it close, visible only to you.

While this concept by Volodymyr Kurbatov isn't real yet, it would be amazing to have AR and AI technology integrated into our everyday financial tools. Such advancements are likely on the horizon, but privacy and security will be the main concerns to address before this becomes a reality.

"This year, we celebrate a monumental milestoneBel Fuse Inc.'s 75th anniversary! Founded by my grandfather and now led by my father, Dan Bernstein as CEO, Bel Fuse stands as a testament to enduring success and unwavering commitment to core values.

Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the dedication, resilience, and integrity that fueled the family business. Here are some fundamental principles that have been passed down through generations, shaping not only Bel's journey but also my approach as an Operating Partner in the private equity space:

- Respecting the Team: Bel has always believed in treating employees like family. This deep respect for the team has fostered a culture of loyalty, collaboration, and mutual growth. It's a principle I hold dear, knowing that a company's true strength lies in its people. 

- Running the Business the Right Way: Integrity has always been at the heart of Bel Fuse. My grandfather's mantra of doing business the right wayfairly, ethically, and transparentlyhas been a cornerstone of success. This ethos guides my interactions and decisions as I work with founders to build sustainable and ethical businesses.

- Balancing Conservatism with Aggression: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the art of balancing conservative strategies with calculated risks. My father has and continues to excel at identifying moments to be bold while maintaining a prudent approach. This balance is crucial in driving growth without compromising stability.

- Consistent Leadership and Values: The importance of consistent leadership and adherence to core values cannot be overstated. At Bel Fuse, leadership is not just about steering the company but embodying the values that have been their foundation. I strive to bring this consistency to portcos I partner with, ensuring that the companies I support stay true to their roots while evolving for future success.

As I reflect on these invaluable lessons, I am filled with pride and gratitude. They have not only shaped Bel Fuse's legacy but also equipped me to support other founders on their journeys. In my current role, I leverage these insights to help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and build businesses that stand the test of time.

Here's to 75 years of Bel Fuseand to many more years of leadership, integrity, and success!

The last two years have been a period of incredible transition for me, both personally and professionally. I am incredibly grateful for the support of my friend and manager, Rachel Spasser, as well as my friends on the Operating Team. This apple is not falling far from the tree. I am excited to be joining Basware, the Accel-KKR company I have supported most in my time with the firm. As Basware's new Chief of Staff I will be working across the firm to help drive value from strategic initiatives. Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by.

"Big news from Samooha by Snowflake today! We have entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Snowflake. A momentous day for the team at Samooha and I can't be more proud of and excited for them. Samooha, means ""A band of people is a group of people who have joined together because they share an interest or belief."" There could be no better characterization of the people in this team who have come together. Samooha's founding hypothesis has been that the newest frontier of data and AI will be built on secure data sharing and collaboration foundations. I have long admired Snowflake's innovation in modernizing the data stack by making privacy and security a foundational product principle and technology pillar. It was only natural to partner with Snowflake from inception, as a platform we started building on. Starting from there to today, where the opportunity of bringing secure data collaboration as a multi-industry category application as a part of Snowflake is beyond exciting for us at Samooha. The prospect that clean rooms become a first class application be it a supply chain logistics enterprise, a pharmaceutical or life sciences company or a media platform is a reality we will unleash across the Snowflake ecosystem. Even more exciting than the opportunity itself is the people I get to do this with. First and foremost is my cofounder Abhishek B. with whom this journey has been inspirational and invigorating taking innovation to another level.

"Here's some preliminary findings from the GivingTuesday Nonprofit Readiness survey:

These include:

* From experimentation to work flow integration:  I've been asking a question at every session I've been doing over the past few years about the audience's current from use on scale from not using, experimented once, use it for a few tasks, integrated into workflow.  The percentages keep moving towards ""integrated into workflow,"" but the entry point is for task.   Experimenting opens up the opportunity to rethink your workflow so it more productive.

* Not Comfortable Yet:  A net promoter score of -28 for comfort. No surprise. The challenge of transfer for any new skill or adoption of a tool is real.  We've seen this before with other emerging tech in the sector.  When a new tech comes along that causes a disruption or change in the way we work, making that change is always slower than we think.  I think about the quote from Deborah Schultz, ""Technology changes, humans don't."" that Gapingvoid Culture Design Group immortalized as a cartoon.

* Team Silos and Loners:  Not surprising to find that AI in nonprofit has not yet achieved enterprise level adoption.   It is either single staff (probably using it without a policy or permission) or team level collaboration. The latter is actually a great change management strategy - to have one team be the early adopters - experiment and share - all with along developing the ethical data guidelines and organizational strategy.  Change management work is slow even the tech is moving so fast. 

Some of the comments and advice from participants included advice that is now outdated. You wont be replaced by AI. Youll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI. Ethan Mollick recently shared why: 1) Your job is more likely to transform over time than be taken
2) Some jobs will really disappear with AI
3) Using AI is going to get easier, it is isnt a secret priesthood
4) Organizations ultimately need to integrate AI into their structures, it isnt all about what individual workers do

https://lnkd.in/gMpuJvqu

There was another comment from one respondent:  Id love to invest in a LLM specifically for the social sector that reflects our values.  While this may not be feasible at this time given that organizational adoption has not moved from silos and loners, but could it be a North Star?  Of course, there are other reasons why this might not be feasible (costs, agreeing on standards, field biased foundational models, etc)

"Challenges Faced by Enterprises in Implementing Generative AI In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, generative AI stands out as a transformative force, promising to reshape how businesses operate and innovate. As enterprises explore the potential of generative AI, they encounter a unique set of challenges that require careful navigation and strategic solutions. In this article, we'll delve into the key hurdles faced by enterprises during the implementation of generative AI and explore effective strategies to overcome them.1. Resource Constraints:Generative AI projects often demand substantial computational resources, both in terms of hardware and skilled personnel. Smaller enterprises, in particular, may find it challenging to allocate the necessary budget and talent. Cloud-based solutions and collaborations with AI service providers can offer scalable and cost-effective alternatives, ensuring that resource constraints don't impede progress.2. Security and Privacy Concerns:With the generation of sensitive and proprietary information, security and privacy become paramount. Enterprises must implement robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard generative AI models and the data they process. Compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, is non-negotiable to ensure responsible and secure AI deployment.3. Integration with Existing Systems:Incorporating generative AI into existing workflows poses a significant challenge. Compatibility issues, integration complexities, and potential disruptions to current operations can create resistance. A thoughtful approach involves conducting a comprehensive system analysis, ensuring seamless integration, and providing adequate training to personnel to facilitate a smooth transition.4. Ethical Considerations and Bias:The ethical implications of generative AI implementation cannot be overstated. Enterprises must actively address concerns related to bias, fairness, and the responsible use of AI. Developing and adhering to ethical guidelines, employing diverse teams in AI development, and implementing continuous monitoring mechanisms are essential steps toward mitigating ethical challenges.While the implementation of generative AI in enterprises is accompanied by challenges, proactive strategies and a commitment to ethical and responsible practices can pave the way for successful integration. InsightGen.ai recognizes these challenges and is dedicated to providing innovative solutions that empower enterprises to harness the full potential of generative AI while addressing the complexities associated with its adoption. By navigating these challenges collaboratively, businesses can position themselves at the forefront of the AI revolution, driving innovation and achieving sustainable growth.For any business related queries, kindly reachout to info@insightgen.aihashtag#GenAI hashtag#GenAIChallenges hashtag#AI",AI or Machine Learning,1,1

"CIOs have had it tough for the last decade. Ever increasing pressure to cut costs while technology continued to leapfrog put them in difficult spot. Squeezing run costs to try and keep up with upgrades and piling technological debt has been a fine and difficult balance to say the least.

Finally with the latest breakthroughs in AI, it is feasible to tame Run costs radically beyond the traditional outsourced managed services levers. But it will require companies to adopt AI as integral part of their workforce, not just another tool for more automation. Are CIOs ready for it?

And are we, the entire IT service provider industry braced for the disruption and crash in demand for traditional IT resources if our clients take such a leap of faith.  When 6th graders can write entire applications using Java, Python, and cloud stacks all via AI tools using simple English prompts, programmer demand is set to plummet.

"During the presentation of my upcoming book, #FigureEight, at HITEC Summit last week, an audience member asked for my take on #AI and #technology regulation. My response touched the following aspects:

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

#Proactive responsibility: Digital companies must set their own #responsibletechnology guardrails ahead of external mandates. As reference, this is the work my colleagues at Thoughtworks have done in collaboration with United Nations: https://lnkd.in/ex96xzHG

"In most subfields of Artificial Intelligence, there lacks a universally accepted definition or clear boundary, with various sources offering slightly different but broadly similar classifications. In the period spanning late 2022 to early 2023, the rise of consumer-facing generative AI tools marked a significant shift in how both the public and enterprises perceived AI's potential. Although discussions about generative AI's capabilities started with the introduction of GPT-2 in 2019, its full promise only became palpable to businesses recently. s  zzs z  s zz  z  Y   z  z  Y ?Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating new content, data, or solutions autonomously by learning from existing data. It leverages machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning and neural networks, to generate outputs that resemble real-world examples.  This technology has a wide range of applications, such as generating art, creating realistic game environments, data augmentation, drug discovery, and even enhancing privacy by generating synthetic datasets. It has significantly contributed to the advancement of AI by enabling more creative and diverse solutions across various domains. Popular generative AI models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformer-based language models (e.g., ChatGPT).Transformer-based language models, like GPT-4, are a class of generative AI models that employ the transformer architecture to excel in natural language processing tasks. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies within textual data, enabling them to generate contextually relevant outputs.  These models are pre-trained on large text corpora, learning patterns, and structures that represent the grammar, syntax, and semantics of a language. Once trained, transformer-based models can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including text generation, where they generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input or prompt. I've developed a graphic that represents what is broadly considered the most accurate understanding of each AI field, aiming to address the question, "" Where does ChatGPT fit?' This is my second revision, and I plan to refine and expand it as my knowledge grows.

"Une Coupe de Cheveux en Provence (with help from GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

In days past, a classic consulting firm interview question involved quantitative estimation, such as asking how many gas stations there are in New York.

I decided to test the quantitative reasoning skills of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with a similar question: What is the size of a town in Provence that might support 2-3 barbers or hair salons?

GPT-4o reasoned that a barber shop or salon might handle 15 clients a day, 5 days a week, and that potential clients might get a haircut every two months, resulting in an estimate of 600 clients per shop, and 1,200 to 1,800 clients for 2-3 shops.

GPT-4o: For instance, a town like Crestet, which has a population of around 400 (as of recent estimates), would likely not support 2-3 salons on its own, but nearby larger towns might.

Given Crestet's small size, you might look for nearby towns such as:

Vaison-la-Romaine: A larger town approximately 15 minutes away, with a population of around 6,000 people, which likely supports multiple barbers and hair salons.

Carpentras: About 30 minutes away, with a population of around 30,000, offering many more options.

Final Recommendation:

For a reliable haircut experience, consider driving to Vaison-la-Romaine or Carpentras, where you will find several barbers and hair salons catering to a larger population. This ensures you have multiple options to choose from.

Finally, it produced the image below.


Claude 3.5 Sonnet asserted that [a] typical hair salon can serve about 100-200 regular clients and assumed that people get haircuts every 6-8 weeks on average.

Using the midpoints of those ranges, it got to 3,375 people to support 2-3 shops.  It then noted that in more rural areas like Provence, people might travel further for services.  We should add a buffer to account for this: let's say 20%.

3,375 * 1.2 = 4,050 people

Finally, it rounded up for a conservative estimate:  To ensure the town can comfortably support 2-3 salons, let's round up.

A town of about 4,500-5,000 people should be able to support 2-3 barbers or hair salons in a rural French setting like Provence.

It did an excellent job of identifying 5 nearby towns as options, based on population and driving distance, and concluded:

Among these options, Vaison-la-Romaine is likely your best bet, given its proximity and adequate size to support multiple hair salons. Orange and Carpentras, while slightly farther, offer more options due to their larger populations. Nyons is a good middle-ground option, while Buis-les-Baronnies might be worth checking if you prefer a smaller town setting.


My assessment: GPT-4o did a better job on the estimation portion of the problem and on the image, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet came up with a nice set of towns.  Based on these analyses, I am heading to Vaison-la-Romaine and will report back in the comments.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name )

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. Thats all great and all,
