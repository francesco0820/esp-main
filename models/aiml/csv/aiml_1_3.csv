"Itâ€™s been 9 months since ChatGPT was released and 7 months since it became the fastest consumer application to reach 100 million monthly active users, ushering in a new era of generative AI. But other than ChatGPT, how are consumers interacting with generative AI products?To begin to answer this question, Olivia Moore and team looked at traffic data from internet-tracking analytics company SimilarWeb to rank the top 50 generative AI web products by monthly visits and analyzed how these products have grown over time, and where growth is coming from. While not an exhaustive ranking of all consumer AI platforms, this list serves as a tool to identify and understand category trends. Here are the top 6 takeaways:1. Most leading products are built from the â€œground upâ€ around generative AI2. ChatGPT has a massive lead, for nowâ€¦3. LLM assistants (like ChatGPT) are dominant, but companionship and creative tools are on the rise4. Early â€œwinnersâ€ have emerged, but most product categories are up for grabs5. Acquisition for top products is entirely organicâ€”and consumers are willing to pay! 6. Mobile apps are still emerging as a GenAI platformDig in and let us know your thoughts on Olivia Moore's takeaways: https://lnkd.in/d5R4x72y",AI/Machine Learning,

"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.Â For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,Â that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, Iâ€™ll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams. Our collaboration with Houston Methodist is one of the largest deployments of generative AI within healthcare today.

"BS-Meter for GenerativeAI (in enterprise setting) - an attempt at calling the bluff ðŸ˜Ž3 weeks of whirlwind conversations with CIOs (thankful and gasping for breath!). Sharing early rushesA. The hype is real but this wave (we are calling it Wave 1) of investments are being channeled primarily into 2 buckets 1. Embedded stacks (offered by stack providers - MSFT, SFDC, and others) 2. Micro-utilities (Customized proofs of concept focused on company-specific use cases, largely in walled-garden secured ""lab environments"")B. Some suppliers and buyers are throwing caution to the wind when it comes to using GenAI as a motherhood term for AI. Here is a quick way to spot BS in the claims that you see floating around ðŸŽ¯GenAI output is probabilisticWhenever you see anyone claim that it can solve a deterministic (that requires accuracy, a decision tree) use case, call out the BS. For example, ""GenAI to craft regulatory submissions"". Note: Most deterministic use cases are best suited for machine learning, not GenAI ðŸŽ¯ GenAI requires human in the loopGenAI creates (text, images, and even voice). However, end products need human ownership (creator for emails, doctor for clinical notes, presenter for powerpoints) for both legal liability and accuracy check. BS example: ""You can use our GenAI product to replace your customer agent"".  ðŸŽ¯ GenAI productivity is proportional to digital maturityGenAI can significantly improve cycle times in product engineering (code generation, testing, refactoring of applications). However, this productivity is true only for stacks that have ""agility"", ""time to market"", etc. as key goals. For legacy engineering stacks and legacy organizations, GenAI is just like a Ferrari on potholed country roads. ðŸŽ¯ GenAI has ""creative potential""How many workflows and tasks in enterprise scenario actually require creativity? Enterprises prefer to work within defined guardrails of legal and compliance. Sure creativity is needed but in context. For example, its a win for a fiction author if the tool shapes the story of a drug extension to solve for ageing; it could be legal liability if the tool writes the marketing collateral for a drug on clinical trial ðŸŽ¯ GenAI needs a value equation (soon!)GenAI is great. However, the hype is being confused for value. As clients expand on micro-utilities (see above) it is clear that they have questions on opportunity cost, value calculation, and better price/solution discovery through specialized procurement. None of these questions have ready answers yetAll you folks (yes, you too!) claiming things about GenAI, I am watching you! ðŸ˜€There may be flaws in my argument (just like GenAI) but then as my brain engineers the prompt on ""Write a GenAI BS meter"" each regenerated response is getting better.

"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 🌈✨

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

🔷 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

🔷 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

🔷 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

🔷 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

🔷 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

It was a day of empowerment and heartfelt connections! 
I'm looking forward to what Day 3 has in store.

"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype.

For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work. To Raghuveer ., Atmaja Apsangi, Sumit Agrawal, Sombir Kadian, I extend my gratitude for fostering the Shark Idea Tank platform, a catalyst that expedited my innovation journey and exposed me to a realm of other ground-breaking ideas. Dattaraj Rao, your insightful articles have been a beacon of knowledge, enriching my understanding of Generative AI concepts. I'm grateful for your time and the opportunity to validate our approach last week. Yogish Pai, Thank you for always being there to support. Without your assistance, resolving issues in a timely manner would have been a Herculean task, making it challenging to complete our prototype within the tight timeframe of 2-3 weeks.","Product Development,AI/Machine Learning,Digital transformation",
"Hello, connections!I am sharing my project titled 'Sentiment Analysis on Brands'.The project performs Turkish Sentiment Analysis and includes the following stages:Data Collection: Instead of relying on a pre-existing dataset, I employed the Web Scraping technique to gather comments from the DonanÄ±mHaber website.(I checked the robots.txt file on DonanÄ±mHaber.)Natural Language Processing: I performed Turkish sentiment analysis with the collected comments, and in this stage, I had to employ a variety of different techniques. For text labeling, I used FLAN-T5 and OpenAI, for feature extraction, I utilized BERT, and for model training, I employed Keras.Sequential().Web Application with Flask: I developed a dynamic web application using Flask to visualize the results of the Sentiment Analysis with Apache ECharts graphics.You can review the project at https://lnkd.in/ds7tfKUV. It contains detailed information about the project, including extensive details in the notebook files.While the project was built dynamically with Flask, if you'd like to explore the website without running the project, you can access the static version https://lnkd.in/dSAi7a7t. Please note that the data at this address isn't dynamic like the Flask application, and it offers only the 'mercedes.html' page since there are no separate sentiment pages for each brand.

"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

So outside of reading a Gartner or McKinsey report on the importance of data in any AI roadmap, it still hasnâ€™t truly sunk in yet. For example â€¦ in the task & approach of either fine tuning a model vs. taking a RAG approach- Fine-tuning involves retraining an existing AI model on a new dataset ... so by default you need large amounts of training data that needs to be accessible, available, and of good hygiene.- RAG involves connecting a retrieval system with a generative model â€¦ so taking information from a well known knowledge base ( that also needs to be accessible & of good hygiene) and using the generative model for search, understanding, and text creation.Either approach has a dependency on accessible & good data â€¦ something we CDOs continuously need to persuade our stakeholders and peers for year after year during our financial cycles of â€œI need X to fix our Yâ€ â€¦ yet we never truly get the investments we need, so the can gets kicked down the road.

It uses a factorized approach that not only allows us to train video generation models more efficiently but also produces higher quality video generations.The outputs of this model were preferred by 96% of respondents over our previous model based on output quality in human evaluations.2ï¸âƒ£ Emu EditThis new model is capable of free-form editing through text instructions. Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs â€” the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"Earlier this year, some AWS developers created an internal tool for Amazonians to experiment with Foundation Models from Amazon Bedrock, and it quickly became a word-of-mouth hit across AWS.Because the interface only required a user to add in a description of the app they wanted to build in a prompt box, the tool could be used by teammates across a wide spectrum of roles and technical expertise.Some built apps for productivity, while others made ones for amusement, or that tapped into personal passions. It was cool to see builders get inspired by using generative AI in a more hands on way, and by sharing their apps with each other, they were actually sharing key generative AI techniques in action.Based on the popularity and feedback, we launched this simple to use but powerful app to the world for free, naming it PartyRock (in reference to it being a fun and collaborativeÂ way to experience Amazon Bedrock). It is built on the belief that everyone should have access to a fun and easy tool to help get started with generative AI.Since launching it last week, tens of thousands of apps have been built and shared, and the creativity has been really cool to see (including apps to organize your re:Invent schedule, plan a Formula 1 trip, and find the best coffee in Vegas).

"Meta AI just dropped EmuVideo, generating 4-second short videos at 512x512 resolution and 16 FPS. Idea is quite straightforward: text -> image first, then do a ""super-resolution"" of the image along the temporal axis to synthesize motion.Long-form videos, however, are still out of reach. I see short videos as a kind of ""system 1 thinking"": you don't need much reasoning to generate 4 seconds.

The architecture, while not explained in details, seems similar to that of DeepMind's Flamigo, with separate text encoder and vision encoder.2. Gemini Pro's performance is similar to GPT-3.5 and Gemini Ultra is reported to be better than GPT-4. Nano-1 (1.8B params) and Nano-2 (3.25B params) are designed to run on-device.3. 32K context length.4. Very good at understanding vision and speech.5. Coding ability: the big jump in HumanEval compared to GPT-4 (74.4% vs. 67%), if true, is awesome. However, the Natural2Code benchmark (no leakage on the Internet) shows a much smaller gap (74.9% vs. 73.9%).6.

"BIG NEWS - The AI Act has been agreed! AI Act implications:1. Risk-Based Tiered System: For AI systems classified as high-risk, clear obligations were agreed. A mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment will now be required. 2. Foundation models will be regulated, following President Bidenâ€™s Executive Order approach, it will apply to models whose training required 10^25 flops of compute power - basically the largest of the large language models. 3. The following systems will be prohibited with just six months for companies to ensure compliance:â–ªï¸biometric categorisation systems that use sensitive characteristics (e.g. political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race);â–ªï¸untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases;â–ªï¸emotion recognition in the workplace and educational institutions;â–ªï¸social scoring based on social behaviour or personal characteristics;â–ªï¸AI systems that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent their free will;â–ªï¸AI used to exploit the vulnerabilities of people (due to their age, disability, social or economic situation).4: High Risk AI systems are subject to transparency requirements.5. High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to manage biases effectively, ensuring that they are non-discriminatory and respect fundamental rights.6. Providers of high-risk AI systems must maintain thorough documentation to demonstrate their compliance with the regulation. This includes records of programming and training methodologies, data sets used, and measures taken for oversight and control.7. The AI Act requires human oversight for high-risk systems to minimise risks, ensuring that human discretion is part of the AI systemâ€™s deployment.8. Sanctions: Non-compliance can lead to substantial fines, ranging from â‚¬35 million or 7% of global turnover to â‚¬7.5 million or 1.5% of turnover, depending on the infringement and company size.Businesses heavily invested in technologies now deemed prohibited, such as biometric categorisation and emotion recognition, may face the need for major strategic shifts. Additionally, enhanced transparency requirements might challenge the protection of intellectual property, necessitating a balance between disclosure and maintaining trade secrets.Companies may also need to invest in higher-quality data and advanced bias management tools, potentially increasing operational costs but enhancing AI system fairness and quality.The documentation and record-keeping requirements will impose a significant administrative burden, potentially affecting the time to market for new AI products.Integrating human oversight into high-risk AI systems will require system design and deployment changes, along with potential staff training.The substantial fines for non-compliance represent a significant financial risk.The rubber has hit the road.

Led by CEO Dan Wright, one-year-old Armada has a ""close collaboration"" with SpaceX and is already valued at close to $250 million, raising $55 million.Cofounded with Jonathan Runyan, Armada was backed pretty much out of the gate by a who's who of defense and industrial minded VCs like Trae Stephens at Founders Fund, Shahin Farshchi at Lux Capital and Shield Capital. It's still in trials with customers, meaning no meaningful revenue yet.Its flagship hardware product is the Galleon, a 40 ft. container of military-grade heavy gauge steel that can fit on a trailer and house 6 racks of GPUs for running AI models in remote environments like oil rigs, mines, and advanced combat ops bases. But it also offers its own app store of AI applications running at the edge, as well as software for managing the use of Space Starlink terminals.Armada also represents something of a comeback for CEO Wright, the former AppDynamics COO who resigned as CEO of AI software unicorn DataRobot last summer amid reported controversy around insider stock sales.And it represents an interesting, and possibly the first, effort by a startup to build on top of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, making them more commercially useful for media companies and others looking to stream video or run AI apps in remote locations.hashtag#edgecomputing hashtag#AI hashtag#edge hashtag#cloud hashtag#cloudcomputing hashtag#spacex hashtag#starlink hashtag#armada hashtag#armadagalleon hashtag#artificialintelligence hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Industry hashtag#defense hashtag#venturecapital hashtag#VC hashtag#startups hashtag#tech hashtag#technology","User Experience,AI/Machine Learning",checked
"I was honored to share my passion for analytics in a recent Forbes article highlighting three trends paving the way for transformation in health care. Hereâ€™s a recap: â¤ï¸ Personalized recommendations. Tools informed by data can help care providers recommend equally effective and more affordable medications, helping reduce financial barriers to care. ðŸ’¡ Reimagined plans and experiences. Wearable devices can provide insights about our health, but the key is knowing what to do with that information. Resources offering real-time, actionable feedback can bring significant value and encourage healthier lifestyle decisions, especially when integrated with a comprehensive care plan. ðŸ¤ Strategic collaborations. Cultivating new relationships can help drive innovation and bring together novel approaches, offering an opportunity to scale solutions to maximize impact. One example is the UnitedHealthcare Accelerator, which helps early startups grow and facilitates a pathway for commercialization. These approaches are driven by data and present a unique opportunity for us to make health care more equitable and affordable.

"Lots of great stuff in here..In my initial read this final rule seems to lay frameworks for requiring mechanistic interpretability of AI/decision support models embedded withih health IT going forward. I expect in practice we will find that most models will consider all of these source attributes to some extent and the binary disclosure of their use will lack meaning. 

Will this governance framework accelerate or impair the development and adoption of clinical decision support tools native to health IT? 

While the policy is well-intentioned, this may turn health IT vendors into marketplaces for decision support models rather than developers of them…

"I'll be publishing my annual predictions for data + AI in hashtag#retail in the next few weeks. One area I predicted - but admittedly nowhere near as strong as we've seen - was the interest in AI such as LLMs. It's on fire because it makes more robust information more accessible to the masses, without technical knowledge. One of the reasons I was hesitant - and still am - has nothing to do with technology. It has to do with data governance, legal rights to data, and control over what is presented to users.OpenAI is highlighting why this is so important.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:ðŸŒŒ Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. ðŸ‘“ Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. ðŸŽ­ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. ðŸ•¶ï¸ Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) ðŸŒ Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology","Digital transformation,Innovation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",checked

We do so by embedding it using an embedding model:ðŸ­: Split text corpus of the entire knowledge base into chunks - a chunk will represent a single piece of context available to be queried. Data of interest can be from multiple sources, e.g. Documentation in Confluence supplemented by PDF reports.ðŸ®: Use the Embedding Model to transform each of the chunks into a vector embedding.ðŸ¯: Store all vector embeddings in a Vector Database.ðŸ°: Save text that represents each of the embeddings separately together with the pointer to the embedding (we will need this later).Next we can start constructing the answer to a question/query of interest:ðŸ±: Embed a question/query you want to ask using the same Embedding Model that was used to embed the knowledge base itself.ðŸ²: Use the resulting Vector Embedding to run a query against the index in the Vector Database. Choose how many vectors you want to retrieve from the Vector Database - it will equal the amount of context you will be retrieving and eventually using for answering the query question.ðŸ³: Vector DB performs an Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search for the provided vector embedding against the index and returns previously chosen amount of context vectors. The procedure returns vectors that are most similar in a given Embedding/Latent space. ðŸ´: Map the returned Vector Embeddings to the text chunks that represent them.ðŸµ: Pass a question together with the retrieved context text chunks to the LLM via prompt. Instruct the LLM to only use the provided context to answer the given question. This does not mean that no Prompt Engineering will be needed - you will want to ensure that the answers returned by LLM fall into expected boundaries, e.g. if there is no data in the retrieved context that could be used make sure that no made up answer is provided.To make it a real Chatbot - face the entire application with a Web UI that exposes a text input box to act as a chat interface. After running the provided question through steps 1. to 9. - return and display the generated answer. This is how most of the chatbots that are based on a single or multiple internal knowledge base sources are actually built nowadays.There are many caveats you might face while building RAG Systems, I'll cover them in the following weeks.--------Follow me to upskill in hashtag#MLOps, hashtag#MachineLearning, hashtag#DataEngineering, hashtag#DataScience and overall hashtag#Data space.ð——ð—¼ð—»â€™ð˜ ð—³ð—¼ð—¿ð—´ð—²ð˜ ð˜ð—¼ ð—¹ð—¶ð—¸ð—² ðŸ‘, ð˜€ð—µð—®ð—¿ð—² ð—®ð—»ð—± ð—°ð—¼ð—ºð—ºð—²ð—»ð˜!Join a growing community of Data Professionals by subscribing to my ð—¡ð—²ð˜„ð˜€ð—¹ð—²ð˜ð˜ð—²ð—¿/ð—•ð—¹ð—¼ð—´.","Data and Analytics,AI/Machine Learning",

"In most subfields of Artificial Intelligence, there lacks a universally accepted definition or clear boundary, with various sources offering slightly different but broadly similar classifications. In the period spanning late 2022 to early 2023, the rise of consumer-facing generative AI tools marked a significant shift in how both the public and enterprises perceived AI's potential. Although discussions about generative AI's capabilities started with the introduction of GPT-2 in 2019, its full promise only became palpable to businesses recently. ð–ð¡ðšð­ ð¢ð¬ ð†ðžð§ðžð«ðšð­ð¢ð¯ðž ð€ðˆ ðšð§ð ð°ð¡ðžð«ðž ðð¨ðžð¬ ð¢ð­ ðŸð¢ð­ ð¢ð§ð­ð¨ ð­ð¡ðž ð¬ðœð¨ð©ðž ð¨ðŸ ð€ðˆ?Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating new content, data, or solutions autonomously by learning from existing data. It leverages machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning and neural networks, to generate outputs that resemble real-world examples.Â This technology has a wide range of applications, such as generating art, creating realistic game environments, data augmentation, drug discovery, and even enhancing privacy by generating synthetic datasets. It has significantly contributed to the advancement of AI by enabling more creative and diverse solutions across various domains. Popular generative AI models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformer-based language models (e.g., ChatGPT).Transformer-based language models, like GPT-4, are a class of generative AI models that employ the transformer architecture to excel in natural language processing tasks. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies within textual data, enabling them to generate contextually relevant outputs.Â These models are pre-trained on large text corpora, learning patterns, and structures that represent the grammar, syntax, and semantics of a language. Once trained, transformer-based models can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including text generation, where they generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input or prompt. Iâ€™ve developed a graphic that represents what is broadly considered the most accurate understanding of each AI field, aiming to address the question, â€˜Where does ChatGPT fit?â€™ This is my second revision, and I plan to refine and expand it as my knowledge grows.

"Every successful startup I've been a part of had a 10x coder. (Despite my best efforts, I was not one.)These elite programmers are hard to find and even harder to hire. Yet everyday engineers are now completing tasks much faster as generative AI-assisted coding has spread like wildfire. Half of developers in 2023 used tools like GitHub Copilot XÂ and Meta just released a major update to its code generation AI model Code Llama.It raises the question: Can anyone become a 10x coder now? The answer: Not yet.A new four-year study analyzed 150+ million changed lines of code and found code churn (i.e., the % of lines reverted or updated <2 weeks weeks after being authored) is projected to double in 2024 compared to the pre-AI baseline in 2021.In short, productivity is up, but quality is down.At Kyber Knight Capital, we believe weâ€™ve entered a new era of â€œaugmented intelligenceâ€ where companies can leverage software to enhance the capabilities of human workers.As youâ€™d expect at the dawn of any new paradigm shift, there will be bumps in the road. But I am still bullish on GenAI as the future of software development,Â especially as free tools like Code Llama democratize access to AI-powered programming.As LLMs improve the code they spit out over time, and developers become better acquainted with the optimal use cases (and limitations) of these tools, I expect the adoption of augmented coding to continue to rise.",AI/Machine Learning,

And nearly every method relies on evaluating LLMs with other LLMs, which can lead to brittleness and bias problems.As more and more LLMs get used in real-world production pipelines, I remain interested to see what kinds of evaluation metrics and methods become the industry standards.https://lnkd.in/gPhKHqTk","Data and Analytics,AI/Machine Learning,Innovation",

"Having started out as an engineer but built my career as an architect, I often come across the question, how technical should enterprise architects be? The answer is…YES! Enterprise Architecture isn't just about strategic alignment, technology vision, efficiency/cost reduction, and managing risk. We also have to be deeply knowledgeable about the tech stacks that drive our enterprise strategy. Case in point, take a look at how the ChatGPT team tackled scaling.
 
If you throw a rock on Linkedin, you're bound to hit a post on #GenAI. Most of these showcase the potential of the buzzworthy technology, but few actually dig into the details on what makes it work. Evan Morikawa from OpenAI presents a refreshing overview of the technical scaling challenges the ChatGPT team had to overcome to create the ""magic"" that everybody is so excited about. Traditional cloud scaling techniques and practices no longer apply since GPU hardware availability is a bottleneck and roundtrip latency is less important. Optimizing batch-sizes and balancing cache and GPU utilization is crucial to optimize efficiency. The architecture needs to continually evolve as demand rises and hardware remains a limiter. 
 
I can't help but find parallels between this and how I think about Enterprise Architecture. The lowest implementation details really does matter to the higher level architecture and approaches. Without understanding exactly why traditional scaling practices no longer applied, we cannot draw up a proper solution and system architecture. In turn, it affects our Enterprise Data and Cloud strategies, which then informs our investment and budget areas, risk…etc, you get the idea. ",AI/Machine Learning,checked
"Last Friday, I had the immense honor of delivering the keynote speech at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Expo, held at the Challenger Learning Center in the vibrant heart of downtown Tallahassee. My talk, titled ""Harnessing AI to Complete the Bench to Bedside Loop in Healthcare,"" aimed to illuminate the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing healthcare, drawing parallels with the iterative nature of space exploration.In the realm of healthcare, the journey from molecular hypothesis (the bench) to the development of a drug and its validation in the real world (the bedside) is intricate and complex. Yet, this is where the magic happens, and AI steps in to bridge the gap. Through my keynote, I explored how AI not only accelerates this process but also enhances our ability to iterate and optimize continuously, ensuring that real-world evidence feeds back into our molecular hypotheses, thereby refining and advancing our understanding.The bench to bedside loop represents a cornerstone of medical research and development, embodying the essence of iterative optimization. With AI, we stand on the brink of being able to automate, scale, and accelerate these iterations like never before, opening up unprecedented possibilities for healthcare advancements.As we say, ""Per aspera ad astra"" - through hardships to the stars. The path to harnessing AI in healthcare is fraught with challenges, but it is also filled with immense potential and hope. I am thrilled to be a part of this journey, contributing to the efforts that aim to revolutionize healthcare for the betterment of humanity.Thank you Florida State University for the invitation!

"AI was at the forefront of many conversations at hashtag#ViVE2024. As an industry, weâ€™ve moved beyond talking about the potential of AI to experimenting with the practical applications. Some insights from the conference: 1. As AI solutions continue to evolve, we canâ€™t afford to let governance take a backseat. Many enterprise healthcare organizations are using AI, with some managing more than 100 different AI-related programs and use cases.Having a consistent framework for managing AI applications is essential. Health2047 Managing Director Judy Barkal is currently taking questions on AI governance for our Ask an Expert series. Submit them here: https://lnkd.in/ey7_hZWa. 2. Nearly a year has passed since the launch of GPT-4 and the explosion of AI solutions across industries. The takeaway at ViVE was loud and clear: now is the time to start evaluating the value and performance of these solutions.Health2047 portfolio company Evidium recently was invited along with other tech companies by a prospective customer to test how AI could be used to understand thousands of chart snippets and map clinical knowledge found to the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model. In 82% of instances, Evidium outperformed the three other solutions evaluated. We need more tools for public validation. 3. AI has tremendous potential to improve productivity and reduce burnout for healthcare practitioners. At the American Medical Association's Physician Innovation Network panel, panelists talked about the importance of viewing burnout as a systemic problem, rather than an individual shortcoming. AI solutions can help augment decision support across the continuum of care and address these issues at scale, but itâ€™s important for them to keep the physician at the center.The Health2047 team is at booth 1038. Stop by to talk healthcare transformation and hear how our portfolio companies Evidium and HOPPR are building physician-informed AI solutions.",AI/Machine Learning,checked

Rotex, a biometric tech startup has created a technique in producing high-performing yet inexpensive e-tattoos (wearable patches) which can be worn to monitor and track the vital signs of the body. These wearable sensors are capable of picking up and transmitting these vital signs while it can also keep track of pulse rate, heart rate, muscle movement, brain activity, temperature, skin hydration level, glucose monitoring and so on. A great use case is that e-tattoo allows you to control a drone/ play video games by sensing muscle movements.clip credit: GiGadgets hashtag#ai hashtag#healthcare hashtag#healthtech hashtag#innovation hashtag#technology","AI/Machine Learning,Customer centricity,Product Development",

"My latest in today's print edition of The Wall Street Journal: The amount of outside software companies are tapping has skyrocketed in the last 10 years. CIOs say theyâ€™re leaning on other areas of the business to help them manage itâ€”but that comes with its own challenges. Katrina Agusti, chief information officer of workwear brand Carhartt is paying for 121 software-as-a-service subscriptions this year, up from 59 five years ago and just 20 a decade agoâ€”an increase thatâ€™s rapidly outpacing the head count growth in the IT department itself. â€œYou just canâ€™t keep pace,â€ she said, adding sheâ€™s letting some business teams take charge of the administrative aspect of the platforms, â€œjust because we donâ€™t have enough IT resources.â€ But with more software procurement and management happening outside IT, there are also concerns about paying for duplicate services, data integration challenges and potential loss of cost efficiencies. â€œItâ€™s not about control, itâ€™s about protecting and making sure weâ€™re being wise with our spend,â€ she said.Priya Saiprasad, general partner at venture-capital firm Touring Capital, said her software portfolio companies are increasingly marketing to end users at companies, rather than CIOs. She added that when enough people at the company are using a service, that company might then approach IT for an enterprisewide license.For some CIOs, that approach isnâ€™t ideal.Â For more, read the full unlocked story here: https://lnkd.in/eU8k-6aEhashtag#tech hashtag#cio hashtag#ai hashtag#artificialintelligence",AI/Machine Learning,

"When we get to AGI, it will have come slowly, not overnight. A NeurIPS Outstanding Paper award recipient, Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage? (by Rylan Schaeffer,Â Brando Miranda andÂ Sanmi Koyejo) studies emergent properties of LLMs, and concludes: ""... emergent abilities appear due the researcherâ€™s choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance."" Public perception goes through discontinuities when lots of people suddenly become aware of a technology -- maybe one that's been developing for a long time --  leading to a surprise. But growth in AI capabilities is more continuous than one might think. That's why I expect the path to AGI to be one involving numerous steps forward, leading to step-by-step improvements in how intelligent our systems are.","AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",

A shift towards a more secure and efficient healthcare ecosystem is crucial for addressing the impact of this breach.For additional Healthcare Security & Technology insights from First Health Advisoryâ€™s Leadership sign up for First Health Fridays at https://lnkd.in/gW7T94Nu or contact us at sales@firsthealthadvisory.com to schedule a consultation.hashtag#EnterpriseRisk hashtag#ThirdPartyRisk hashtag#ThirPartyRiskManagement hashtag#HealthcareIT hashtag#HealthcareSecurity hashtag#HealthcareOrganization hashtag#CyberRiskManagement hashtag#DataSecurity hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#CyberRisk hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#MedTech hashtag#HealthcareAI hashtag#AI","Digital transformation,AI/Machine Learning",

"Iâ€™ve never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services Iâ€™ve been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you canâ€™t access healthcare the way you should, itâ€™s terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldnâ€™t get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctorâ€™s office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. Iâ€™m especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI â€“ especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning â€“ was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate â€œdoctor speak,â€ to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. Itâ€™s easier than ever to build. (Iâ€™m currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning â€“ if I can do it, you can, too.)Iâ€™m excited to share with you whatâ€™s next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
📈 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
🖥 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
🏥 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
⌚ With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"Do you have enough compute power to progress your AI ambition with GPUs?GPUs (Graphics Processing Units, from companies such as Nvidia) are essential for advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to their unique architecture that excels at the kind of computations needed for training complex AI models. GPUs provide a significant speed boost for AI compared to CPUs. This allows researchers to train more complex models in shorter timeframes, leading to faster progress in AI development.Parallel Processing Power: Unlike CPUs (Central Processing Units) with a few cores optimized for sequential tasks, GPUs have thousands of cores. This allows them to handle many calculations simultaneously, which is crucial for training AI models that involve massive amounts of data and complex mathematical operations.Efficiency for Specific Tasks: GPUs are designed for processing graphics, which involves manipulating large datasets of pixels. This translates well to AI tasks that also deal with vast datasets, such as image recognition or natural language processing.Memory Bandwidth Advantage: GPUs boast high memory bandwidth, meaning they can transfer large amounts of data quickly between the processor and memory. This is essential for AI models that constantly access and process big datasets during training.","AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",checked

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name 🤦🏽‍♂️)

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. That’s all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model that’s not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon? 😉

"As a seasoned professional deeply entrenched in the mission-critical datacenter sector, recent articles on AI have struck a chord with me, highlighting several crucial points. Firstly, they underscore the necessity for AI datacenter reference designs, with companies like Schneider Electric leading the way. Secondly, these articles shed light on the challenges posed by our aging infrastructure. Lastly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) forecasts that AI's evolution will disrupt 85 million jobs globally by 2025 while creating 97 million new roles.This transformative shift has significantly altered power demand dynamics, necessitating datacenter infrastructure capable of accommodating ever-expanding compute loads. As AI data centers consume a larger share of electricity, our aging power grid faces vulnerabilities, with 70% of its components over 25 years old. This underscores the emergence of non-tech AI investment opportunities, particularly in sectors such as power providers and datacenter infrastructure, where upgrades are essential to meet the demands of the digital age.

"Big news. Google just introduced a method to steal model information from black-box production language models like ChatGPT or PaLM-2.""Our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively.""They focus on the model's embedding projection layer, which is the last layer of the model. This layer is responsible for translating the internal representations of data (the ""hidden dimensions"") into a format that the model can use to make predictions or generate text.

"Last month, I was joined by 25 leaders across a dozen or so industries to discuss some of the more pressing questions around AI leadership, driving adoption, responsible deployment, the crucial balance between upskilling existing talent & bringing in fresh perspectives to bolster AI capabilities, and securing funding for AI initiatives.This morning, I had a seat at the table with another group of 25 data, analytics, and AI leaders to dig deeper. Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity. Organizations are implementing measures like acceptable tool lists, usage tracking, and effective communication around risk.-The application of GenAI in content generation demands clearer legal and regulatory guidance. Some organizations have airtight governance processes to ensure the responsible utilization of their AI tools.-While there are common risk factors across internal applications and customer-facing applications, there are additional concerns regarding the associated risks with customer-facing applications, particularly in safety-critical industries.-Future topics for discussion will include customizing and securing OpenAI chat interfaces, the complexities of data security, ensuring employee familiarity with administrative protocols, and optimizing OpenAI API usage.We look forward to reconvening next month.

"Up here, looking down from the peak of Aiguille Rouge at 3226 meters, it's hard not to be inspired. The mix of snow, sun, and clouds paints a picture of what balance looks like. It makes me think about how we can apply lessons from this stunning environment to the world of customer experience (CX), artificial intelligence (AI), and sustainability.I see AI as a powerful tool, like the sun lighting up these mountains, that can help us understand and cater to our customers better. We can use AI to predict what our customers need before they even know they need it. Like the way these clouds move and change, AI can help us be more adaptable and personalized in our approach.But, with great power comes great responsibility. Every innovation we make with AI needs to be weighed against its impact on our planet. Just as we marvel at the beauty of untouched snow, we need to protect the natural beauty of our world. We must strive for sustainability in everything we do, making sure that our advancements in CX and AI don't come at the cost of our environment.This photo, from the top of the world, is a reminder to me. It tells me that our work with AI and CX should mirror the balance and beauty of nature.
