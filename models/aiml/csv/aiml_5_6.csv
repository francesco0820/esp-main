*WE* design it and *WE* build it.

I can imagine thousands of scenarios where a turbojet goes terribly wrong.
Yet we managed to make turbojets insanely reliable before deploying them widely.

The question is similar for AI:
 ""do we think there exists at least one design of an AI system that is simultaneously safe/controllable, and can fulfill objectives in more intelligent ways than humans ?""
If the answer is yes, we'll be fine.
If the answer is no, we won't build it.
Right now, we don't even have a hint of a design of a human-level intelligent system.

Imagine an AI-powered credit card with augmented reality (AR) that displays your balance and other stats when you hold it close, visible only to you.

While this concept by Volodymyr Kurbatov isn't real yet, it would be amazing to have AR and AI technology integrated into our everyday financial tools. Such advancements are likely on the horizon, but privacy and security will be the main concerns to address before this becomes a reality.

AI is about to massively disrupt every industry. The real opportunity lies not in LLMs, which will be commoditized and dominated by big tech, but in startups focused on vertical applications of AI.

Jurny exemplifies this perfectly. In my opinion, they are the best-positioned company to disrupt the $4.7 trillion hospitality industry, which is riddled with inefficiencies.

Their traction is off the charts 📈, and for a limited time, they are opening investment to customers and retail investors alongside top-tier venture capitalists. If you are considering an investment in AI, you won’t want to miss this chance. https://lnkd.in/gXNv8PYm

https://www.linkedin.com/in/katyaandresen/,"I continue to hold two different views of AI - I see the benefits and potential but also the downside.  If you only see the benefits and get sucked into the hype, you can run into trouble.  If you only focus on the downside, you potentially miss out on the benefits.  I want to leverage the good while mitigating the downsides - which means understanding it and making sure your staff understand it and have formal responsible use guidelines and training.

That's why I read both critical and praising articles/reviews about AI, especially AI product releases. And, also put my hands on it myself to experience with benefits and drawbacks.

This a critical review of chatGPT4o and worth a read. The author points out the demo was a ""preview"" of advanced features being tested in controlled ways. The actual product release did not have all the features calling it a ""bait and switch.""  That's hype.  He compared it to product releases like mobile phones that show features in release demos that are actually in the product release.

""This tactic, in which A.I. companies promise wild new features and deliver a half-baked product, is becoming a trend that is bound to confuse and frustrate people . . . With artificial intelligence, companies are giving a preview of a potential future, demonstrating technologies that are being developed and working only in limited, controlled conditions. A mature, reliable product might arrive — or might not.""

He goes onto review the new features or ""improvements"" that were in the product release.He shares a couple of detailed examples of the common problem with LLMs, even this new improved version: hallucinations.  The models provide outright or subtle wrong answers or made up answers reinforcing the need to really check its work and not fall asleep at the wheel.

This article reminds us that when companies rush to release half-baked product, users are the product.  OpenAI said its iterative approach to updating ChatGPT allowed it to gather feedback to make improvements. “We believe it’s important to preview our advanced models to give people a glimpse of their capabilities and to help us understand their real-world applications,” the company said in a statement.

The bottom line from this review:

A major thing OpenAI got right with ChatGPT-4o is making the technology free for people to try. Free is the right price: Since we are helping to train these A.I. systems with our data to improve, we shouldn’t be paying for them.
The best of A.I. has yet to come, and it might one day be a good math tutor that we want to talk to. But we should believe it when we see it — and hear it.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Great to spend time with clients from JPMorganChase Mutual of Omaha Bank Rockland Trust Newmark CoBank Protective General Insurance Services, now part of OSC Insurance Services at a great game where the Washington Nationals lost narrowly, 8-7 to the New York Mets

Great to attend the National Flood Insurance Program FEMA Conference to understand flood risk to every property, how to make properties and communities more resilient and how to leverage AI to help achieve these goals.

At CoreLogic we leverage AI to innovate …

Where every property attribute counts like first floor height (a major contributor to understanding flood risk in relation to the topology of the adjacent land)…

Where every pixel counts - where we use image analytics to identify wildfire resiliency factors on properties in California to reduce wildfire insurance premiums by up to 20% (e.g factors like fence is 12 feet away, no flammable materials within 5 feet and identifying enclosed roof eaves)

Where every property counts - use supercomputing to understand the financial risk to every property due to climate change … initially up the year 2050 - enables regulators to shape policy, investors/lenders assess risk, insurers price premiums and set resilency factors to reduce premiums.

This is CoreLogic 2.0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpossley/,"Can generative image models be good world models?
This work from @Meta FAIR shows that there is a tradeoff between realism and diversity.
The more realistic a generative model becomes, the less diverse it becomes.
Realism comes at the cost of coverage.
In other words, the most realistic systems are mode-collapsed.

My hunch, supported by a growing amount of empirical evidence, is that world models should *not* be generative.
They should make predictions in representation space.
In representation space, unpredictable or otherwise irrelevant information is absent.
This is the main argument in favor of JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fgpadilha/,"Une Coupe de Cheveux en Provence (with help from GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

In days past, a classic consulting firm interview question involved quantitative estimation, such as asking how many gas stations there are in New York.

I decided to test the quantitative reasoning skills of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with a similar question: “What is the size of a town in Provence that might support 2-3 barbers or hair salons?”

GPT-4o reasoned that a barber shop or salon might handle 15 clients a day, 5 days a week, and that potential clients might get a haircut every two months, resulting in an estimate of 600 clients per shop, and 1,200 to 1,800 clients for 2-3 shops.

GPT-4o: “For instance, a town like Crestet, which has a population of around 400 (as of recent estimates), would likely not support 2-3 salons on its own, but nearby larger towns might.”

“Given Crestet's small size, you might look for nearby towns such as:

Vaison-la-Romaine: A larger town approximately 15 minutes away, with a population of around 6,000 people, which likely supports multiple barbers and hair salons.

Carpentras: About 30 minutes away, with a population of around 30,000, offering many more options.

Final Recommendation:

For a reliable haircut experience, consider driving to Vaison-la-Romaine or Carpentras, where you will find several barbers and hair salons catering to a larger population. This ensures you have multiple options to choose from.”

Finally, it produced the image below.


Claude 3.5 Sonnet asserted that “[a] typical hair salon can serve about 100-200 regular clients” and assumed that “people get haircuts every 6-8 weeks on average.”

Using the midpoints of those ranges, it got to 3,375 people to support 2-3 shops.  It then noted that in “more rural areas like Provence, people might travel further for services.  We should add a buffer to account for this: let's say 20%.

3,375 * 1.2 = 4,050 people”

Finally, it rounded up for a conservative estimate:  “To ensure the town can comfortably support 2-3 salons, let's round up.

A town of about 4,500-5,000 people should be able to support 2-3 barbers or hair salons in a rural French setting like Provence.”

It did an excellent job of identifying 5 nearby towns as options, based on population and driving distance, and concluded:

“Among these options, Vaison-la-Romaine is likely your best bet, given its proximity and adequate size to support multiple hair salons. Orange and Carpentras, while slightly farther, offer more options due to their larger populations. Nyons is a good middle-ground option, while Buis-les-Baronnies might be worth checking if you prefer a smaller town setting.”


My assessment: GPT-4o did a better job on the estimation portion of the problem and on the image, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet came up with a nice set of towns.  Based on these analyses, I am heading to Vaison-la-Romaine and will report back in the comments.

The event, held in Las Vegas, is a technology showcase held for HPE business and government customers. 

During the session, Perry said he and his staff see key training opportunities in respect to AI that work to enhance the productivity of highly skilled clinical, research, and administrative professionals. These groups all need to have both a grasp on the evolution of AI, as well as how it can and will impact their respective operations. 

To help advance our knowledge and discovery of pediatric diseases, St. Jude built a GenAI framework to integrate deep learning models into data science programs. The effort supports the institution's ongoing strategic investments in data science, which date back to the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project which at the time was the largest investment and most comprehensive effort to identify and understand the genetic origins of cancer. 

Perry was also recently honored by Becker's Healthcare’s 2024 “CIOs to know” list, which recognizes IT executives at health systems and hospitals throughout the U.S. who are leading strategic initiatives, implementing new electronic health record systems, enhancing cybersecurity and deploying telehealth services.

🔹 There's a lot of discussion about how AI can revolutionize education and healthcare worldwide. However, it's important to recognize the significant implications of AI in agriculture as well.

🔸 While India has more than 20 official languages and a multitude of regional languages and dialects, AI holds immense potential for preserving and revitalizing endangered languages. This technology can be used to create language learning tools, analyze historical texts, and even generate new content in these languages.

🔹 Additionally, we explored how AI can help revolutionize spiritual content based on our rich cultural legacy and a vast collection of manuscripts. We also delved into the question of whether AI can truly help mankind, particularly in the realm of emotional or spiritual intelligence.

Huge thanks to the Executive Head and staff at Doordarshan Kendra for giving me this opportunity!

At Amazon, Success & Scale Bring Broad Responsibility — and that’s something those of us working on health care across Amazon think about every day. We believe generative AI and Large Language Models have the potential to inject more humanity into health care and enhance the experience for providers and patients - in ways that are truly transformative. 
 
On Thursday, June 27, I'll join Katie Couric, Sandra Abrevaya, Dan Sheeran (he/him) and Alex Rives  to unpack how AI is shaping the future of health care and the advancements Amazon is making in this area. More details below. I hope to see you there!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertroley/,"Today we are announcing that we are the first observability platform to integrate with NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices). This announcement continues our strategy of extending our AI investment, and follows previous announcements of AI monitoring, New Relic (our GenAI Assistant), and AIOps.
 
Several organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI for a variety of use cases, and whether they are in experimentation, limited testing or full scale production, understanding how their AI investment is performing and returning value is critical. That is because running and deploying AI applications is costly and hard to get right. NIM helps this, but often LLMs are a part of the overall application, so New Relic allows you to observe all parts of the application, both AI and non-AI portions. Our investment in NVIDIA NIM allows customers to extend observability to NVIDIA’s microservices architecture.

Observability is uniquely suited to solving these challenges for business. This integration further reduces complexity and costs of developing, deploying, and monitoring AI applications. 

Customers can use New Relic AI monitoring to gain a comprehensive view of AI applications built with NVIDIA NIM, along with key metrics on throughput, latency, and costs while ensuring data privacy. 

I am proud that our team is always anticipating and solving for our customers' needs ahead of the market. And there is still so much more to come.

I covered four key points.
 
First – Common cases for AI. These include improving the customer experience, better network planning and response to issues, and supporting employees by, for example, generating code.
 
Second – Prepare for AI. Create a data strategy and an investment case. Start with pilot projects and ensure seamless integration with existing systems and processes. And most importantly, implement ethical guidelines and monitor AI performance and outcomes.
 
Third – Partnerships. Work with hyperscalers to gain access to the latest AI tech, improve cost efficiency, focus on core business functions, and accelerate innovation, all while ensuring robust security and compliance.
 
Fourth – Balance the risk of being too early vs too late. Thoroughly evaluate pilot programs, collaborate, and share experiences with partners.
 
Ultimately AI must meet our purpose, which is to connect people securely, safely and with their privacy as a priority.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"One of the biggest problems with trying to use generative AI today is that AI is only capable of generating things that ""look like"" other things. 

This morning I was creating a framework in Miro and I just needed an arc line to draw something. They didn't have that shape, so I asked their AI to draw me one... and got a very unexpected result. Why would Miro think that I would want it to draw me a whole flow chart?

I think this is reflective of a larger issue with AI in the industry: tools trying to make things that ""look like"" deliverables rather than things that facilitate the design process. 

It is an important distinction. I have a friend who was subcontracting for another consultant working on a design project. This consultant, I think, really believed in the power of generative AI, but there were other flaws in his thinking. For example, he wanted my friend to draw a Theory of Change diagram, but she didn't have enough context for the client and capabilities. It eventually became very clear that this consultant didn't think about a Theory of Change diagram as a part of the design PROCESS, but actually thought of it as a ""deliverable."" What he really wanted was something that ""looked like"" a Theory of Change diagram.

We see the same thing when the hottest AI tool uses Figma to draw an interface. What we're seeing isn't an interface design, it is something that ""Looks like"" an interface design. The design PROCESS isn't about producing something that looks like an interface and throwing it over the wall—when we draw things in Figma, we're creating centerpieces for conversations on a team. The team is full of brains that have context-specific knowledge, and the picture / diagram we're drawing is a way for us to synthesize that knowledge. 

I do draw a lot of flow charts, but Miro can't possible know what needs to be in my flow chart because usually I don't know. Flow charts are something that me and a team go back and forth on refining and refining—discovering questions and then tracking down answers, then updating the chart. When we get to the ""end,"" what we have is a composite of contextual knowledge that had probably never been synthesized before. 

It is just an odd thing. 

 
There might be a market for this. This consultant I mentioned might be happy with the outputs of AI generated things—but I think that this is something holey different from the design process.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,AI/Machine Learning,,Image,Monique,TeSalle,National Grid,Utilities,"Director, Product Design // Head of Design for U.S. Customer",2024-07-02 15:56,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206986782301696001,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQGDQyprF0REDw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718111699734?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=yyqYdcnB4lhXN10Sf6m84_yYIAwFHP3M5IIErAHdwRA,,,,,20,9,0,3w,,,,Monique TeSelle finds this insightful,,,2024-06-13 07:52,,,,,,,,,Thursday,11:52 AM,6/13/2024,,,,,,,,,

THIS IS NOT NEW YORK: Generative Explorations of the Urban Landscape 

What AI dreams beyond the frame of my pictures?
In this personal exhibition, I have embarked on an exploratory journey, redefining the essence of what photography can be. This exploration begins with some pictures I took in New York and allows AI the space to imagine what lies beyond the frame of my original photo. 
This collection blurs the line between the tangible and the imagined in a process that transcends mere image production, venturing into a realm where the organic and the synthetic converge, and the known melds with the fantastical.  The AI serves as an augmentation of my artistic vision, amplifying my creative potential and propelling me into unexplored territories. It enables me to create images that challenge the viewer's expectations.

""This is not New York"" offers a glimpse into the future of artistic and photographic innovation, a tribute to the new frontiers accessible through the synergy of technology and human creativity.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/carazocarlos/,"What an amazing week last week at Edison Electric Institute's 2024 conference.  It was the first time I attended this conference and will definitely be back!  Special thanks to Pedro Pizarro, Maria Pope, Calvin Butler, Dan R. Brouillette and the rest of the EEI Board for hosting Jensen Huang and me for a very thought-provoking lunch, followed by a great fireside chat between Pedro and Jensen discussing the future of Energy and the role #AI will play. 

So many great discussions with utility leaders and especially enjoyed my panel discussion with Hema Sundaram, Neva Espinoza, Maria Robinson hosted by Mary Sprayregen on AI: The Next Big Opportunity for Collaboration.  It was clear that utilities will benefit from open industry specific generative AI models that can be leveraged to help the entire industry move faster towards meeting our clean energy goals. 

AI is poised to revolutionize the utilities sector in numerous ways. By harnessing the power of AI, utilities can optimize grid management, enhance predictive maintenance, and improve demand forecasting. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, allowing for quicker decision-making and more efficient resource allocation. This leads to increased operational efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced reliability of energy supply. Additionally, AI can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources by predicting their availability and managing their intermittency, thus supporting the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

Generative AI will play a crucial role in this transformation. Gen AI can create advanced predictive models and simulations, enabling utilities to better anticipate and prepare for various scenarios. It can also automate complex processes, reducing human error and freeing up resources for more strategic tasks. Furthermore, Gen AI can enhance customer engagement by providing personalized recommendations and solutions, thus improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. The potential of Gen AI in driving innovation and efficiency in the utilities sector is immense and will be a key factor in achieving our clean energy goals.

Was also excited to see the team from Deloitte and Utilidata announce a partnership to scale the Karmen distributed AI platform.   A software defined grid is a sustainable grid.  An open platform like Karmen allows for third party players to join in helping provide innovative applications that will reduce costs to rate payers while providing more resilient, reliable, secure and sustainable operations.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-nimsger/,"This chart about the costs of training AI large language models (LLMs) caught my attention. Economic theory—particularly in the technology industry—has long suggested that supply-side innovation can cause prices to fall rapidly for critical infrastructure, even with increasing demand. Think of computer hardware and semiconductor chips as prime examples. 

Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, saw that theory in action. Moore observed that as the number of transistors on a computer chip doubled over a period of about 18 months, the price of the chip over the same period fell by about half. That was way back in 1965—and the so-called “Moore’s law” for chip progress and pricing has continued to hold roughly true for the nearly six decades since (a veritable eon in the tech world). But fast forward to 2024, and generative AI seems to be turning Moore’s law on its head: costs of training the next generation of LLMs aren’t halving; instead, prices have roughly doubled every nine months. 

So what explains this reversal? It’s all about how LLMs scale.

To date, many of the AI race’s main drivers have seemed to be hyper-fixated on scaling up the existing architecture. Many LLM champions believe that to get to where AI wants to go, “scale is all you need”. Just make the transformer models bigger and more powerful, their thinking goes, and LLMs will revolutionize the economy and—for some—lead to artificial generalized intelligence. That view is why frontier model company CEOs talk about numbers like $10-billion training costs for a model and a $100-billion supercomputer.
 
But today, I’m hearing more and more about scaling down. In stark contrast to LLMs, the small language model (SLM) “theory” is that smaller models, more tightly engineered for narrower applications and domains, will increasingly supplant LLMs. The same way that fine-tuned four-cylinder engines in a modern BMW 4 series outperform (more horsepower with better gas efficiency) the V8 450-cubic-inch engines that used to power Corvettes. SLMs are also typically trained on finely curated high-quality data sets—analogous to the high-octane gas that the four-cylinder engine needs to use. As such, the costs of SLMs may map more closely to Moore’s law than their large-language counterparts. 

For the moment, developers and investors are essentially betting on both of these theories—LLMs and SLMs—simultaneously. However, that probably won’t continue forever in the same fashion. 

“Scale-is-all-you-need” LLMs will have to demonstrate extraordinary ROI to justify their $100-billion price tags, while SLMs will have to prove that they are flexible enough to fit multiple use cases and continue to improve their efficiency at domain-specific tasks. Companies adopting AI will also need to decide when they need a fine-tuned BMW and when they need a powerhouse Corvette. 

I believe this is one of the most fascinating and consequential races in the AI world right now…and one to watch closely.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-nimsger/,AI/Machine Learning,,Image,Kristin,Nimsger,Thoma Bravo,Private Equity,Operating Partner,2024-07-02 16:12,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7212263893224579073,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEruMb6AFWI8Q/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1719520679803?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=CBsFX4djeImiVTgVVS5_e6ccuIUPDsPnkEKtUFQ5bbM,,,,,523,26,35,4d,,,,Kristin Nimsger Weston likes this,,,2024-06-27 21:21,,,,,,,,,Friday,1:21 AM,6/28/2024,,,,,,,,,
