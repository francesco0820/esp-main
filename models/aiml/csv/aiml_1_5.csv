"It's been 9 months since ChatGPT was released and 7 months since it became the fastest consumer application to reach 100 million monthly active users, ushering in a new era of generative AI. But other than ChatGPT, how are consumers interacting with generative AI products?To begin to answer this question, Olivia Moore and team looked at traffic data from internet-tracking analytics company SimilarWeb to rank the top 50 generative AI web products by monthly visits and analyzed how these products have grown over time, and where growth is coming from. While not an exhaustive ranking of all consumer AI platforms, this list serves as a tool to identify and understand category trends. Here are the top 6 takeaways:1. Most leading products are built from the ""ground up"" around generative AI2. ChatGPT has a massive lead, for now""3. LLM assistants (like ChatGPT) are dominant, but companionship and creative tools are on the rise4. Early ""winners"" have emerged, but most product categories are up for grabs5. Acquisition for top products is entirely organic""and consumers are willing to pay! 6.

"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams.

"BS-Meter for GenerativeAI (in enterprise setting) - an attempt at calling the bluff Y Z3 weeks of whirlwind conversations with CIOs (thankful and gasping for breath!). Sharing early rushesA. The hype is real but this wave (we are calling it Wave 1) of investments are being channeled primarily into 2 buckets 1. Embedded stacks (offered by stack providers - MSFT, SFDC, and others) 2. Micro-utilities (Customized proofs of concept focused on company-specific use cases, largely in walled-garden secured ""lab environments"")B. Some suppliers and buyers are throwing caution to the wind when it comes to using GenAI as a motherhood term for AI. Here is a quick way to spot BS in the claims that you see floating around YZ GenAI output is probabilisticWhenever you see anyone claim that it can solve a deterministic (that requires accuracy, a decision tree) use case, call out the BS. For example, ""GenAI to craft regulatory submissions"". Note: Most deterministic use cases are best suited for machine learning, not GenAI YZ  GenAI requires human in the loopGenAI creates (text, images, and even voice). However, end products need human ownership (creator for emails, doctor for clinical notes, presenter for powerpoints) for both legal liability and accuracy check. BS example: ""You can use our GenAI product to replace your customer agent"".  YZ  GenAI productivity is proportional to digital maturityGenAI can significantly improve cycle times in product engineering (code generation, testing, refactoring of applications). However, this productivity is true only for stacks that have ""agility"", ""time to market"", etc. as key goals. For legacy engineering stacks and legacy organizations, GenAI is just like a Ferrari on potholed country roads. YZ  GenAI has ""creative potential""How many workflows and tasks in enterprise scenario actually require creativity? Enterprises prefer to work within defined guardrails of legal and compliance. Sure creativity is needed but in context. For example, its a win for a fiction author if the tool shapes the story of a drug extension to solve for ageing; it could be legal liability if the tool writes the marketing collateral for a drug on clinical trial YZ  GenAI needs a value equation (soon!)GenAI is great. However, the hype is being confused for value. As clients expand on micro-utilities (see above) it is clear that they have questions on opportunity cost, value calculation, and better price/solution discovery through specialized procurement. None of these questions have ready answers yetAll you folks (yes, you too!) claiming things about GenAI, I am watching you! Y There may be flaws in my argument (just like GenAI) but then as my brain engineers the prompt on ""Write a GenAI BS meter"" each regenerated response is getting better.

 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work.

For text labeling, I used FLAN-T5 and OpenAI, for feature extraction, I utilized BERT, and for model training, I employed Keras.Sequential().Web Application with Flask: I developed a dynamic web application using Flask to visualize the results of the Sentiment Analysis with Apache ECharts graphics.You can review the project at https://lnkd.in/ds7tfKUV. It contains detailed information about the project, including extensive details in the notebook files.While the project was built dynamically with Flask, if you'd like to explore the website without running the project, you can access the static version https://lnkd.in/dSAi7a7t.

"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

"Earlier this year, some AWS developers created an internal tool for Amazonians to experiment with Foundation Models from Amazon Bedrock, and it quickly became a word-of-mouth hit across AWS.Because the interface only required a user to add in a description of the app they wanted to build in a prompt box, the tool could be used by teammates across a wide spectrum of roles and technical expertise.Some built apps for productivity, while others made ones for amusement, or that tapped into personal passions. It was cool to see builders get inspired by using generative AI in a more hands on way, and by sharing their apps with each other, they were actually sharing key generative AI techniques in action.Based on the popularity and feedback, we launched this simple to use but powerful app to the world for free, naming it PartyRock (in reference to it being a fun and collaborative  way to experience Amazon Bedrock). It is built on the belief that everyone should have access to a fun and easy tool to help get started with generative AI.Since launching it last week, tens of thousands of apps have been built and shared, and the creativity has been really cool to see (including apps to organize your re:Invent schedule, plan a Formula 1 trip, and find the best coffee in Vegas).

"Meta AI just dropped EmuVideo, generating 4-second short videos at 512x512 resolution and 16 FPS. Idea is quite straightforward: text -> image first, then do a ""super-resolution"" of the image along the temporal axis to synthesize motion.Long-form videos, however, are still out of reach. I see short videos as a kind of ""system 1 thinking"": you don't need much reasoning to generate 4 seconds. But system-2 type video generation needs coherence, long-term memory, and much higher computational cost.Regardless, EmuVideo is still a big upgrade on the video diffusion quality.

The architecture, while not explained in details, seems similar to that of DeepMind's Flamigo, with separate text encoder and vision encoder.2. Gemini Pro's performance is similar to GPT-3.5 and Gemini Ultra is reported to be better than GPT-4. Nano-1 (1.8B params) and Nano-2 (3.25B params) are designed to run on-device.3. 32K context length.4. Very good at understanding vision and speech.5. Coding ability: the big jump in HumanEval compared to GPT-4 (74.4% vs. 67%), if true, is awesome. However, the Natural2Code benchmark (no leakage on the Internet) shows a much smaller gap (74.9% vs. 73.9%).6. On MMLU: using COT@32 (32 samples) to show that Gemini is better than GPT-4 seems forced. In 5-shot setting, GPT-4 is better (86.4% vs. 83.7%).7.

"BIG NEWS - The AI Act has been agreed! AI Act implications:1. Risk-Based Tiered System: For AI systems classified as high-risk, clear obligations were agreed. A mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment will now be required. 2. Foundation models will be regulated, following President Biden's Executive Order approach, it will apply to models whose training required 10^25 flops of compute power - basically the largest of the large language models. 3. The following systems will be prohibited with just six months for companies to ensure compliance:aai biometric categorisation systems that use sensitive characteristics (e.g. political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race);aai untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases;aai emotion recognition in the workplace and educational institutions;aai social scoring based on social behaviour or personal characteristics;aai AI systems that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent their free will;aai AI used to exploit the vulnerabilities of people (due to their age, disability, social or economic situation).4: High Risk AI systems are subject to transparency requirements.5. High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to manage biases effectively, ensuring that they are non-discriminatory and respect fundamental rights.6. Providers of high-risk AI systems must maintain thorough documentation to demonstrate their compliance with the regulation. This includes records of programming and training methodologies, data sets used, and measures taken for oversight and control.7. The AI Act requires human oversight for high-risk systems to minimise risks, ensuring that human discretion is part of the AI system's deployment.8. Sanctions: Non-compliance can lead to substantial fines, ranging from a35 million or 7% of global turnover to a7.5 million or 1.5% of turnover, depending on the infringement and company size.Businesses heavily invested in technologies now deemed prohibited, such as biometric categorisation and emotion recognition, may face the need for major strategic shifts. Additionally, enhanced transparency requirements might challenge the protection of intellectual property, necessitating a balance between disclosure and maintaining trade secrets.Companies may also need to invest in higher-quality data and advanced bias management tools, potentially increasing operational costs but enhancing AI system fairness and quality.The documentation and record-keeping requirements will impose a significant administrative burden, potentially affecting the time to market for new AI products.Integrating human oversight into high-risk AI systems will require system design and deployment changes, along with potential staff training.The substantial fines for non-compliance represent a significant financial risk.The rubber has hit the road.

It's still in trials with customers, meaning no meaningful revenue yet.Its flagship hardware product is the Galleon, a 40 ft. container of military-grade heavy gauge steel that can fit on a trailer and house 6 racks of GPUs for running AI models in remote environments like oil rigs, mines, and advanced combat ops bases.

Will this governance framework accelerate or impair the development and adoption of clinical decision support tools native to health IT?

"I'll be publishing my annual predictions for data + AI in hashtag#retail in the next few weeks. One area I predicted - but admittedly nowhere near as strong as we've seen - was the interest in AI such as LLMs. It's on fire because it makes more robust information more accessible to the masses, without technical knowledge. One of the reasons I was hesitant - and still am - has nothing to do with technology. It has to do with data governance, legal rights to data, and control over what is presented to users.OpenAI is highlighting why this is so important. If you were building AI capabilities for your business, you need to ensure that you have control and rights to the data within it. We will see companies more widely embrace open-source foundational models in 2024 for this very reason.",AI or Machine Learning

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:Y Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. Y Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. YZ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. Yi  Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) Y Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology",AI or Machine Learning

"What are 2 2 1   o2 2 s22 14 (s)    2o ?Here is an example of a simple RAG based Chatbot to query your Private Knowledge Base.First step is to store the knowledge of your internal documents in a format that is suitable for querying. We do so by embedding it using an embedding model:Y: Split text corpus of the entire knowledge base into chunks - a chunk will represent a single piece of context available to be queried. Data of interest can be from multiple sources, e.g. Documentation in Confluence supplemented by PDF reports.Y: Use the Embedding Model to transform each of the chunks into a vector embedding.Y : Store all vector embeddings in a Vector Database.Y: Save text that represents each of the embeddings separately together with the pointer to the embedding (we will need this later).Next we can start constructing the answer to a question/query of interest:Y: Embed a question/query you want to ask using the same Embedding Model that was used to embed the knowledge base itself.Y2: Use the resulting Vector Embedding to run a query against the index in the Vector Database. Choose how many vectors you want to retrieve from the Vector Database - it will equal the amount of context you will be retrieving and eventually using for answering the query question.Y3: Vector DB performs an Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search for the provided vector embedding against the index and returns previously chosen amount of context vectors. The procedure returns vectors that are most similar in a given Embedding/Latent space. Y : Map the returned Vector Embeddings to the text chunks that represent them.Y: Pass a question together with the retrieved context text chunks to the LLM via prompt. Instruct the LLM to only use the provided context to answer the given question. This does not mean that no Prompt Engineering will be needed - you will want to ensure that the answers returned by LLM fall into expected boundaries, e.g. if there is no data in the retrieved context that could be used make sure that no made up answer is provided.To make it a real Chatbot - face the entire application with a Web UI that exposes a text input box to act as a chat interface. After running the provided question through steps 1. to 9. - return and display the generated answer.

"In most subfields of Artificial Intelligence, there lacks a universally accepted definition or clear boundary, with various sources offering slightly different but broadly similar classifications. In the period spanning late 2022 to early 2023, the rise of consumer-facing generative AI tools marked a significant shift in how both the public and enterprises perceived AI's potential. Although discussions about generative AI's capabilities started with the introduction of GPT-2 in 2019, its full promise only became palpable to businesses recently. s  zzs z  s zz  z  Y   z  z  Y ?Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating new content, data, or solutions autonomously by learning from existing data. It leverages machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning and neural networks, to generate outputs that resemble real-world examples.  This technology has a wide range of applications, such as generating art, creating realistic game environments, data augmentation, drug discovery, and even enhancing privacy by generating synthetic datasets. It has significantly contributed to the advancement of AI by enabling more creative and diverse solutions across various domains. Popular generative AI models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformer-based language models (e.g., ChatGPT).Transformer-based language models, like GPT-4, are a class of generative AI models that employ the transformer architecture to excel in natural language processing tasks. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies within textual data, enabling them to generate contextually relevant outputs.  These models are pre-trained on large text corpora, learning patterns, and structures that represent the grammar, syntax, and semantics of a language. Once trained, transformer-based models can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including text generation, where they generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input or prompt. I've developed a graphic that represents what is broadly considered the most accurate understanding of each AI field, aiming to address the question, "" Where does ChatGPT fit?' This is my second revision, and I plan to refine and expand it as my knowledge grows.

"Every successful startup I've been a part of had a 10x coder. (Despite my best efforts, I was not one.)These elite programmers are hard to find and even harder to hire. Yet everyday engineers are now completing tasks much faster as generative AI-assisted coding has spread like wildfire. Half of developers in 2023 used tools like GitHub Copilot X  and Meta just released a major update to its code generation AI model Code Llama.It raises the question: Can anyone become a 10x coder now? The answer: Not yet.A new four-year study analyzed 150+ million changed lines of code and found code churn (i.e., the % of lines reverted or updated <2 weeks weeks after being authored) is projected to double in 2024 compared to the pre-AI baseline in 2021.In short, productivity is up, but quality is down.At Kyber Knight Capital, we believe we've entered a new era of ""augmented intelligence"" where companies can leverage software to enhance the capabilities of human workers.As you'd expect at the dawn of any new paradigm shift, there will be bumps in the road.

"a  YY 12  121 314o  14 1  14    2?LLMOps is crucial for building LLM applications in producion. Without it, you will lose control of your application and will struggle to debug any arising issues.Luckily, a number of companies have realized this and started building LLMOps platforms. While they all try to help you improve your applications, they vary in their approaches and the features they deliver.Below I am comparing 4 popular LLMOps platforms to help you find out which is best for you: LangSmith, Langfuse (YC W23), orq.ai, and Comet.YY i  Y o : The LLMOps platform by the popular LLM framework LangChain. As you would expect, if you are using LangChain, this platform integrates very seamlessly and provides great analytics. The main downside in my opinion is its lack of customizability, when it comes to versioning and reporting metrics.Ya Y 3  2: An open-source LLMOps platform that focuses on open integration with all kinds of frameworks (e.g., langflow, litellm, langchain etc.). It is most developer-focused out of the 4. It is developing rapidly with new features being added on a weekly basis.Y 34 2  : A fully enterprise-focused solution. Orquesta is a no-code solution that natively integrates with vector databases and LLM providers to make experimentation and monitoring even easier. They currently do not support all open-source models.a i  14o2  Y: An established platform that also handles traditional MLOps. It is the most customizable as you have all the custom graphs and experiments you could use in MLOps. However, it has the fewest LLM-focused features making it more difficult to quickly get started and run experiments.Bear in mind, that all these applications are very novel and are developing rapidly. Moreover, there are more LLMOps tools popping up every day and it will be exciting to see how this field develops.What are you experiences with LLMOps?

"What's the difference between the many types of AI? Here is a quick explanation below.As a note - there are many types of machine learning that don't use neural networks. Even though probably 70-75% of machine learning uses the Deep Learning/Neural Network architecture, there are a lot of applications outside of it.The best example is gradient boosting trees. It's an algorithm for tabular AI and is used for more structured data and predictive analytics. It still outperforms the neural network setup for that particular use case.Hope this helps!hashtag#AI hashtag#ML hashtag#genai hashtag#llm hashtag#neuralnetworks",AI or Machine Learning

"Having started out as an engineer but built my career as an architect, I often come across the question, how technical should enterprise architects be? The answer is...YES! Enterprise Architecture isn't just about strategic alignment, technology vision, efficiency/cost reduction, and managing risk. We also have to be deeply knowledgeable about the tech stacks that drive our enterprise strategy. Case in point, take a look at how the ChatGPT team tackled scaling.
 
If you throw a rock on Linkedin, you're bound to hit a post on #GenAI. Most of these showcase the potential of the buzzworthy technology, but few actually dig into the details on what makes it work. Evan Morikawa from OpenAI presents a refreshing overview of the technical scaling challenges the ChatGPT team had to overcome to create the ""magic"" that everybody is so excited about. Traditional cloud scaling techniques and practices no longer apply since GPU hardware availability is a bottleneck and roundtrip latency is less important. Optimizing batch-sizes and balancing cache and GPU utilization is crucial to optimize efficiency. The architecture needs to continually evolve as demand rises and hardware remains a limiter. 
 
I can't help but find parallels between this and how I think about Enterprise Architecture. The lowest implementation details really does matter to the higher level architecture and approaches. Without understanding exactly why traditional scaling practices no longer applied, we cannot draw up a proper solution and system architecture. In turn, it affects our Enterprise Data and Cloud strategies, which then informs our investment and budget areas, risk...etc, you get the idea. ",AI or Machine Learning
"Last Friday, I had the immense honor of delivering the keynote speech at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Expo, held at the Challenger Learning Center in the vibrant heart of downtown Tallahassee. My talk, titled ""Harnessing AI to Complete the Bench to Bedside Loop in Healthcare,"" aimed to illuminate the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing healthcare, drawing parallels with the iterative nature of space exploration.In the realm of healthcare, the journey from molecular hypothesis (the bench) to the development of a drug and its validation in the real world (the bedside) is intricate and complex. Yet, this is where the magic happens, and AI steps in to bridge the gap. Through my keynote, I explored how AI not only accelerates this process but also enhances our ability to iterate and optimize continuously, ensuring that real-world evidence feeds back into our molecular hypotheses, thereby refining and advancing our understanding.The bench to bedside loop represents a cornerstone of medical research and development, embodying the essence of iterative optimization. With AI, we stand on the brink of being able to automate, scale, and accelerate these iterations like never before, opening up unprecedented possibilities for healthcare advancements.As we say, ""Per aspera ad astra"" - through hardships to the stars. The path to harnessing AI in healthcare is fraught with challenges, but it is also filled with immense potential and hope. I am thrilled to be a part of this journey, contributing to the efforts that aim to revolutionize healthcare for the betterment of humanity.Thank you Florida State University for the invitation! Let's continue to explore, iterate, and optimize, for the future of healthcare is bright, and it is ours to shape.

"AI was at the forefront of many conversations at hashtag#ViVE2024. As an industry, we've moved beyond talking about the potential of AI to experimenting with the practical applications. Some insights from the conference: 1. As AI solutions continue to evolve, we can't afford to let governance take a backseat. Many enterprise healthcare organizations are using AI, with some managing more than 100 different AI-related programs and use cases.Having a consistent framework for managing AI applications is essential. Health2047 Managing Director Judy Barkal is currently taking questions on AI governance for our Ask an Expert series. Submit them here: https://lnkd.in/ey7_hZWa. 2. Nearly a year has passed since the launch of GPT-4 and the explosion of AI solutions across industries. The takeaway at ViVE was loud and clear: now is the time to start evaluating the value and performance of these solutions.Health2047 portfolio company Evidium recently was invited along with other tech companies by a prospective customer to test how AI could be used to understand thousands of chart snippets and map clinical knowledge found to the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model. In 82% of instances, Evidium outperformed the three other solutions evaluated. We need more tools for public validation. 3. AI has tremendous potential to improve productivity and reduce burnout for healthcare practitioners. At the American Medical Association's Physician Innovation Network panel, panelists talked about the importance of viewing burnout as a systemic problem, rather than an individual shortcoming. AI solutions can help augment decision support across the continuum of care and address these issues at scale, but it's important for them to keep the physician at the center.The Health2047 team is at booth 1038. Stop by to talk healthcare transformation and hear how our portfolio companies Evidium and HOPPR are building physician-informed AI solutions.",AI or Machine Learning
"Diffusion can ""render"" algorithms. It implements a maze traversal algorithm purely from pixels, by literally painting a red line from the beginning position to the end on a maze.Very interesting experiment. I always think of diffusion as a renderer, and transformer as the reasoning engine.

"When we get to AGI, it will have come slowly, not overnight. A NeurIPS Outstanding Paper award recipient, Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage? (by Rylan Schaeffer,  Brando Miranda and  Sanmi Koyejo) studies emergent properties of LLMs, and concludes: ""... emergent abilities appear due the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance."" Public perception goes through discontinuities when lots of people suddenly become aware of a technology -- maybe one that's been developing for a long time --  leading to a surprise. But growth in AI capabilities is more continuous than one might think. That's why I expect the path to AGI to be one involving numerous steps forward, leading to step-by-step improvements in how intelligent our systems are.",AI or Machine Learning
"Healthcare Entities are in Need of Secure and Efficient Digital Transformation: https://lnkd.in/gAEnFxyb The Change Healthcare breach has sparked debates on the necessary change in the healthcare industry, with some focusing on security solutions and others on AI. The irony lies in the duality of the challenge: healthcare organizations have not adequately addressed past threats yet continue to pursue new technology that they do not fully understand or can secure.

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. It's easier than ever to build. (I'm currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning "" if I can do it, you can, too.)I'm excited to share with you what's next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name )

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. Thats all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model thats not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon?

"As a seasoned professional deeply entrenched in the mission-critical datacenter sector, recent articles on AI have struck a chord with me, highlighting several crucial points. Firstly, they underscore the necessity for AI datacenter reference designs, with companies like Schneider Electric leading the way. Secondly, these articles shed light on the challenges posed by our aging infrastructure. Lastly, the World Economic Forum (WEF) forecasts that AI's evolution will disrupt 85 million jobs globally by 2025 while creating 97 million new roles.This transformative shift has significantly altered power demand dynamics, necessitating datacenter infrastructure capable of accommodating ever-expanding compute loads. As AI data centers consume a larger share of electricity, our aging power grid faces vulnerabilities, with 70% of its components over 25 years old. This underscores the emergence of non-tech AI investment opportunities, particularly in sectors such as power providers and datacenter infrastructure, where upgrades are essential to meet the demands of the digital age.

"Last month, I was joined by 25 leaders across a dozen or so industries to discuss some of the more pressing questions around AI leadership, driving adoption, responsible deployment, the crucial balance between upskilling existing talent & bringing in fresh perspectives to bolster AI capabilities, and securing funding for AI initiatives.This morning, I had a seat at the table with another group of 25 data, analytics, and AI leaders to dig deeper. Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity. Organizations are implementing measures like acceptable tool lists, usage tracking, and effective communication around risk.-The application of GenAI in content generation demands clearer legal and regulatory guidance. Some organizations have airtight governance processes to ensure the responsible utilization of their AI tools.-While there are common risk factors across internal applications and customer-facing applications, there are additional concerns regarding the associated risks with customer-facing applications, particularly in safety-critical industries.-Future topics for discussion will include customizing and securing OpenAI chat interfaces, the complexities of data security, ensuring employee familiarity with administrative protocols, and optimizing OpenAI API usage.We look forward to reconvening next month.

Utilizing platforms like MuleSoft to integrate platforms, MDM solutions to create a mastered view of data, and Salesforce #DataCloud to provide activation points for data across channels and platforms of engagement, banks can start to leverage predictive intelligence from machine learning models to be ""proactive and predictive"" in their approach to making better informed decisions.The added benefit of advancing data architecture and data strategy is that it provides significant utility if/when an organization starts to formulate their strategy to Generative AI.

After about 10 years of blogging, I moved the blog to The Financial Brand for a few years, then blogged on Cornerstone's site for a couple of years before moving it again to Forbes and renaming it the Fintech Snark Tank.All told, I've published more than 1,600 blog posts about #banking and #fintech.

"Thoma Bravo's Annual Meeting wrapped up last week in Miami and it's always a great opportunity to share perspectives with our LPs and answer probing questions that investors rightly ask, as we together aim to make sense of an extraordinarily complicated  and incredibly interesting  business environment in 2024 and beyond.  I gave a detailed presentation on the state of the software market as we see it today. Sharing here a couple of charts from that presentation that to me encapsulate the core of our firm's investment thesis and distinctive value proposition.  In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market  now in its third decade  continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital  particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.",AI or Machine Learning

"When I shadow seller's workflows, I swear I always see ~5 different tabs open to keep track of all of the relevant signals for outbound.This drives me (and sellers) insane--so we built a highly requested new feature at Unify.Our new activity feed brings all of your intent data and signals, from prospecting to sequencing, into one place.Because Unify's an all-in-one intent + sequencing product, we natively collect a ton of different signals and data points.With our in-house sequencing product live, customers can view email opens, clicks, website intent (powered by 6sense and Clearbit) and G2 intent all within our activity feed.So, you can:1) See the data all in one place2) Understand how they interact with each other3) Add prospects to sequence in just a couple clicksNo more clicking back and forth between a million Chrome tabs. No more trying to piece together a prospect's timeline. I walk through a demo of the activity feed and a few use cases in the Loom video right here.

"Moving from industry titans like ABB, Eaton, and Schneider Electric to working with CX, digital change, and AI has been a big shift. Last week's Schneider Electric Innovation Summit in Paris was a vivid reflection of the transformative power of technology. Yet, it also marked a moment of personal transition as I move deeper into the world of CX and digital innovation Assist Digital.In my past jobs, I helped make products that power our world. Now, I'm working on how companies talk to their customers using digital tools and AI. This change is big.

"Here's a song (.. the audio) completely created by AI . A new song blending Punjabi vibes with Bollywood style, all created by an AI app called Suno AI, recently hit the internet. Although it didn't quite match the 'Kala Chasma' video it was set to, it's a cool example of what AI can do in music. Suno AI lets users whip up songs just from text prompts, and it's getting pretty good at it.But not everyone's thrilled about this tech wave. Big names like Katy Perry and Billie Eilish are worried. They, along with 200 other artists, have warned that AI could undercut musicians by making tracks without needing people, which could slash what artists earn from their work.The debate heated up when a Pink Floyd anniversary video made with AI won a contest, causing a stir about whether AI is taking over creative jobs. This concern isn't just in music. Authors and movie folks have also raised red flags about AI using their work without permission or payment.Despite the worries, AI has its upsides in creativity. It's helping musicians finish songs or add cool effects to their shows, like Madonna using AI visuals in her concerts. While the debate on AI's role in the arts continues, it's clear that the world around is changing fast.",AI or Machine Learning

"""Architecture plays a vital role and thus, the role of the Solution Architect"" -- said Anthony Sneed when I posed him the question about steps enterprises can take to control the cost of Cloud Migration -- a topic that is at the top of mind on the eve of my fireside chat with Yar Savchenko tomorrow at the Innotech Dallas event at 1 PM CT on the topic -- ""Are you happy with Cloud Migration -- A Reality Check!""Developers focus on the services needed from an applications perspective but it is the Architect who has to ensure that the overall solution is cost-effective, compliant, conforming to standards, secure while addressing several non-functional requirements.

"Let's talk about AI hype. I'll be honest with you, I've been a little bit embarrassed to be associated with AI recently. Human achievement is incremental, but where's our patience for it? We got a massive speedup on progress, yet the expectations seem to be that we should be solving all of [fill in your favorite massive challenge for humankind] in a week. No, a day. Yesterday!Can we calm down, please? AI is just another approach to automation. Automation is not new and it's not ""solved.""There is so much good stuff in the AI space, but reality doesn't read like a cheap sci-fi paperback. Whatever you're seeing in the tech news either usually took years or is smoke and mirrors. My team and I spend a lot of time thinking about how long things would take in a perfect world where we had a perfect technology in our hands. (No one has that. And if I ever say something else in a pitch, it's time to put me out of my misery.)There's always plenty to solve that's not about the tech. The most important part isn't what we *can* do. The most important part is what we *should* do and why we should do it and for whom... ""You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.... It has to start with 'What incredible benefits can we give to the customer?' Not 'let's sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then figure out how we can market that."" Steve Jobs said this at WWDC '97, but 26 years later the sentiment holds!Sure, I'm loving this latest AI wave. It's fun to build things that were previously impossible to build, and it's exciting to theorize on where this will be 15-20 years from now!But as a consumer  and new CEO  of AI products, I understand the AI disillusionment that's been creeping up recently. People have been promised magic, but LLMs are still just a tool! They can drive incredible results *and* they are imperfect tools that need a lot more work.Remember your audience and what problem you're trying to solve. Selling to enterprise? Consider their scalability and security needs. Selling to developers? Consider their savvy and how they'll use your product.Consumers are smart. They want things that actually solve problems. Technology is cool, but the industry wins when products are built to solve specific problems for specific people.************Speaking of balanced takes, I'm always delighted to promote webinars by Akmal Chaudhri, Esq. of SingleStore (let's continue to encourage him to stay one of the good guys).

"Mihika Kapoor is a PM at Figma where she's known as the go-to person for leading 0-to-1 products. She was an early PM of FigJam, is currently leading a new (undisclosed) product that's launching at Figma's Config conference this year, and is beloved by everyone who works with her.In our conversation, we discuss:  Advice for taking ideas from 0 to 1 at larger companies  How to craft a compelling vision  How to tactically communicate your vision  The importance of vulnerability and feedback  Advice for building a strong team culture  Pivoting priorities with grace and enthusiasm  AI and its impact on PMs  Much moreListen now YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gMed2MdGSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gbNUk-ZcApple: https://lnkd.in/gNb4pBDyKey takeaways:1. Putting ideas out there, even if they are wrong, can lead to better solutions and more productive discussions. It's not just about having a great idea or building a prototype; it's about actively engaging and rallying others around that idea to create momentum and excitement. Whether it's pitching ideas at events like hackathons or simply asking colleagues for assistance, the key is to not let perceived limitations hold you back from pursuing your vision.2. Mihika likens the role of a 0-to-1 team within a large company to that of Hestia in Greek mythology, who is the keeper of the hearth. It is Hestia's job to always keep the hearth burning, even while other gods go out on separate quests. This means always keeping the 0-to-1 project alive and helping it spread to others, mostly through setting vision and building hype.3. To set the vision for a new idea, ask: If I and my team do our job correctly, what does the world look like? Then convey the pain point, solution, and proof in a format that can show, not tell stakeholders what you're doing. For example, use prototypes, Figma mock-ups, and customer testimonials.4. Internal hackathons are a great way to encourage innovation. Figma has a Maker Week where the entire companyincluding technical and non-technical employeesgoes on pause for a week to work on ambitious ideas. Maker Week and other internal hackathons have led to many successful Figma products, including Jambot and Figma's entire widget platform.5. Figma implements a fun hot seat tradition, where each person takes turns being in the hot seat for a set amount of time. During their turn, the person can be asked anything by the other members of the group. By understanding what motivates each team member and building strong relationships, collaboration becomes more effective, leading to a more enjoyable work environment and ultimately better outcomes for the product or project. The key is to create a comfortable and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels open to sharing.",AI or Machine Learning

"AI is coming for drug discovery in a big way.

Xaira is one of this years most richly funded new companies, not only in biotech but across the startup world. 

Historically, theres been a fair amount of luck involved in discovering antibodies, and it is rife with failure  only about 10% of drugs that make it to human testing are ever approved. 

Using AI to make drugs isnt a new idea. Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into earlier startups with little to show for it. And many scientists remain deeply skeptical of de novo antibody generation  using computers to design brand new proteins. 

Xaira and several other new biotechs believe they can change that with new generative AI methods that can design complex molecules from scratch, find new targets, and cut months or even years from the process.

"TechCrunch: Conversational AI platform Parloa has nabbed $66 million in a Series B round of funding, a year after the German startup raised $21 million from a swathe of European investors to propel its international growth.

Aside form lead investor Altimeter, Parloas Series B round included cash injections from EQT Ventures, Newion, Senovo, Mosaic Ventures and La Familia Growth. Todays funding brings Parloas total capital raised to-date to $98 million, following its $21 million Series A funding round led by EQT Ventures in 2023.

Parloa is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI with everything hype that has hit fever pitch these past couple of years, as companies seek new ways to improve efficiency through automation.

Founded out of Germany in 2018, Parloa has already secured high-profile customers such as European insurance giant Swiss Life and sporting goods retailer Decathlon, which use the Parloa platform to automate customer communications including emails and instant messaging.

However, voice is where co-founder and CEO Malte Kosub reckons Parloa stands out.

Our strategy has always been centered around voice first, the most critical and impactful facet of the customer experience, Kosub told TechCrunch over email. As a result, Parloas AI-based voice conversations sound more human than any other solution.

"Four years ago, Jonathan Elial reached out to me and my company The Lean Marketer to help define the messaging for a brand-new startup he'd co-founded with Yonatan Geifman and Ran El-Yaniv (thanks Ariel Geifman for the intro!). 

I had the pleasure of working with these three brilliant people in their Tel Aviv co-working space as we wrestled to make the complex problem Deci AI (Acquired by NVIDIA) solved easy to understand (well easier, anyway ), built their initial marketing materials -- web site, deck, white paper, case study...you know the drill -- and take their first steps out into the world. 

Remember that back then, hardly anyone knew what an LLM or generative AI was, or the massive resources it took to make them run efficiently. So we were inventing a language. And the talented Arik Mergi helped bring that language to life visually. 

Four years is an eternity in startup-time, and naturally, Deci and its marketing grew and evolved so much since we worked together in those early days, with Rachel Salkin at the helm. I take immense pleasure in having worked with Deci's talented co-founders and contributing my small part at the beginning of their journey, and I am so thrilled to congratulate Deci on their recent acquisition by NVIDIA!",AI or Machine Learning

" Our (Jan Worner, DEng, Aleksandra Turtova, and myself) conference paper ""Transformative Potentials and Ethical Considerations of AI Tools in Higher Education: Case Studies and Reflections"" has been published on IEEE Xplore!

This paper delves into the effective and ethical use of AI in educational settings, emphasizing the integration of tools like ChatGPT in both English composition and introductory computer science courses. Conducted in the spring of 2023 at Oral Roberts University, shortly after the release of ChatGPT, our research demonstrates that students who utilized AI as an integral part of their learning process gained significantly more knowledge.

Key Insights:
 In computer science, ChatGPT introduced novel problem-solving techniques, enhancing student engagement and understanding of programming concepts.
 In English composition, the tool aided in the development of writing skills, underscoring the importance of balancing AI assistance with critical human thinking.
 The paper addresses crucial ethical concerns, including privacy, the risk of overreliance on technology, and potential biases, advocating for AI to complement traditional teaching methods responsibly.

" Im excited to announce what weve been working on for the last few months: the creation of Yuna, an AI and storytelling startup, and our $1.6 million dollar pre-seed round  

So whats the story? 

The sobering reality is that the magic of reading books is slowly being replaced by other forms of media. Each successive generation is enjoying fewer of the well known benefits that come with getting lost in a wonderful book (cognitive development, creativity, empathy, to name but a few).

What if we could reverse this trend? What if we could find a way to make reading just as engaging as watching Netflix, and eventually the 1st entertainment choice for children?

And so we wrote Yuna into existence. By combining AI with the enchantment of human creativity, Yuna writes books that are so personalised and interactive that they can be as engaging as any modern media platforms. Leveraging AI to empower writers, illustrators and publishers, Yuna imagines new forms of storytelling:

 Imagine a book that every night writes the next chapter of a personalised adventure involving you, your daughter and dog, weaving your familys interests into the narrative.

 Imagine a book that invites your niece to enter Hogwarts as a 1st year student and experience their own unique story through the wizarding world.

 Imagine a book that helps you discuss difficult topics with your son but in the form of an imaginary tale with him and his favourite character Snoopy. 

Over time, we hope to make these dreams come true, all with a singular goal: to ensure that children build a healthy reading habit for life.

Thanks to the hard work of the incredible Yuna team, weve been testing early versions of these ideas. Over the past 5 months, Yuna has written 100,000+ unique stories to 20,000 monthly active users. And we are growing fast - we expect to write the next 100,000 books within a few weeks of this announcement. Thank you Yuna team - you are truly epic.

A massive thank you to the partners involved in our $1.6M pre-seed round: Canary who led and who have been incredible every day since (special shoutout to Florian Hagenbuch who has been a believer and mentor from day -1); The Positive Ventures team and angel investors who followed the round and recognised Yunas potential to make a positive impact on the world (thank you especially to Fabio Kestenbaum!). Finally - Taahir Munshi, Pedro Sonego de Oliveira, Flora Oliveira, Fabian Wikstrom and Carolina Guimaraes, who played pivotal roles in turning Yuna from distant dream to reality during those early days. 

Now what?

Today, we are launching our beta test product in Brazil in Portuguese. If you are in Brazil, please give it a shot (see link in comments). If you are not, Yuna isnt available to test just yet, but fear not! Yuna is bringing its vision to the  very soon.

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders... how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent... how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within... saving to reinvest

Learn more about our journey & where were headed  https://hubs.la/Q02wqnxn0.

Today marks a monumental milestone for Rad AI as we celebrate the successful closure of our Series B round. A heartfelt thank you to our new and continuing partners as well as investors who share our commitment to transforming radiology through cutting-edge technology.

 The Impact: Why This Matters
Since 2018, Rad AI has been pioneering generative AI in healthcare, introducing the first proprietary LLMs for commercial healthcare applications. Today, Rad AI is the most trusted GenAI platform for radiology workflow, used by over a third of US health systems and 9 of the 10 largest US radiology practices.

Our latest solution, Rad AI Reporting, builds on the success of Rad AI Omni Impressions to fully replace legacy voice recognition software. Rad AI Reporting supports all existing radiologist workflows and introduces new GenAI capabilities to simplify reporting, significantly reducing provider fatigue and burnout while improving productivity. Recently, it was named Best New Radiology Software by AuntMinnie.com, the best-known annual recognition in radiology.

Thank you to our incredible team, whose dedication and innovation has brought us here. The journey continues, and with this support, we are more equipped than ever to advance our mission to transform healthcare.

"It's a big week for Rad AI with the announcement of our $50M Series B Funding round led by Khosla Ventures. 

As we celebrate this milestone and chart out course for the future, I can't help but reflect back to 2019 when Jeff Chang and Doktor Gurson were just getting started. Dr. Chang was a practicing radiologist at Greensboro Radiology and I was leading the sales team at Canopy Partners (a sister company). 

I remember joining Dr. Chang for one of his first sales meetings with our hometown health system Cone Health. We met with key execs, listened to their challenges, and asked probing questions about how #AI might be able to address some of these challenges. Dr. Chang took copious notes and, as we left the meeting, I asked him if he came away with any useful ideas for products. He did indeed and Cone Health ultimately became Rad AI's first health system client. 

I remember this like it was yesterday because I was so impressed with Dr. Chang's commitment to listening and developing innovative products designed to improve care delivery and solve customer challenges. That was 5 years ago and Rad AI has grown tremendously since then, but this customer-first approach is still in the DNA of our company today ... and I hope it always will be.

"Here's some preliminary findings from the GivingTuesday Nonprofit Readiness survey:

These include:

* From experimentation to work flow integration:  I've been asking a question at every session I've been doing over the past few years about the audience's current from use on scale from not using, experimented once, use it for a few tasks, integrated into workflow.  The percentages keep moving towards ""integrated into workflow,"" but the entry point is for task.   Experimenting opens up the opportunity to rethink your workflow so it more productive.

* Not Comfortable Yet:  A net promoter score of -28 for comfort. No surprise. The challenge of transfer for any new skill or adoption of a tool is real.  We've seen this before with other emerging tech in the sector.  When a new tech comes along that causes a disruption or change in the way we work, making that change is always slower than we think.  I think about the quote from Deborah Schultz, ""Technology changes, humans don't."" that Gapingvoid Culture Design Group immortalized as a cartoon.

* Team Silos and Loners:  Not surprising to find that AI in nonprofit has not yet achieved enterprise level adoption.   It is either single staff (probably using it without a policy or permission) or team level collaboration. The latter is actually a great change management strategy - to have one team be the early adopters - experiment and share - all with along developing the ethical data guidelines and organizational strategy.  Change management work is slow even the tech is moving so fast. 

Some of the comments and advice from participants included advice that is now outdated. You wont be replaced by AI. Youll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI. Ethan Mollick recently shared why: 1) Your job is more likely to transform over time than be taken
2) Some jobs will really disappear with AI
3) Using AI is going to get easier, it is isnt a secret priesthood
4) Organizations ultimately need to integrate AI into their structures, it isnt all about what individual workers do

https://lnkd.in/gMpuJvqu

There was another comment from one respondent:  Id love to invest in a LLM specifically for the social sector that reflects our values.  While this may not be feasible at this time given that organizational adoption has not moved from silos and loners, but could it be a North Star?  Of course, there are other reasons why this might not be feasible (costs, agreeing on standards, field biased foundational models, etc)

"What a fantastic Fireside chat with Lorraine Bardeen, Corporate VP and CTO of Microsoft! 

Gracias, Lorraine, for sitting down with Miriam Hernandez-Kakol, HITEC Vice Chair, to share your thoughts on leadership, change management, authenticity and being AI ready! 

Lorraine provided us with powerful nuggets of information, such as: 
- Take a chance on yourself, show courage  20 seconds of confidence can go a long way! 
- Break through certainty and consider the counterpoint; spend energy on what you dont know. 
- Modeling is a core part of how we lead people, walk the walk! 
- Use your platform to share your authentic self and invite others to join you. 

The characteristic that makes her a better leader is connecting people to ideas, which help deliver results. The other is modeling and showing vulnerability, creating environments where people can feel comfortable not knowing what to do so that change can happen. People need knowledge (skilling) and to feel safe to try something new.  Make your team feel safe and give them space to do so, this will enable change management. 

To be AI ready, leaders must know where to spend time and energy.  Is it: 
- Revitalizing and energizing customer experience? 
- Enriching your employee experience? 
- Reshaping business processes that are clunky, repetitive, and redundant? 
- Bending the curve on innovation? 
(HINT: Start with #4!) 

The session closed out by speaking about authenticity and intersectionality: Every person in this room has intersectionality. The bigger your platform, the more you talk out loud and pull people with you to create psychological safety. Our hope is that no one needs to wait to have a platform to show constant authenticity and claim their identity.

"This week at the Accenture Oracle Leadership Council conference, I had the opportunity to be on a panel with my colleague Greg Pavlik and Accentures Technology Strategy & Advisory Practice Koenraad Schelfaut to share our AI strategy and some practical use cases. Our team started this journey with first migrating to the cloud, and then continuously modernizing and expanding with various cloud native services.  From there, we enhanced our search engine with our internal sites, by cleansing, curating, and aggregating our various data sets along with leveraging AI and ML capabilities, we have successfully been able to better understand our users intent with providing more accurate and relevant search results. With the hundreds of thousands of clicks we get daily, we are seeing over 30% in improvement with the click-through rates, as well as significant reduction in support tickets.  We also enhanced our support experience leveraging genai capabilities on OCI incorporating our own datasets with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model architecture the percentage of queries resolved has resulted in upwards of 30% case deflection, as well as great improvements in ticket volume reductions, resolution times, user satisfaction, and productivity gains for our agents and users.  These are just a few of the use cases we are exploring and continuously fine tuning to improve our models and outcomes for our user community.

"Connectivity remains a critical challenge for almost every organization. The chief culprit is digital fragmentation, a byproduct of digital shifts that, paradoxically, lead to digital silos and disjointed technical architectures that leave the average enterprise now juggling over 364 applications and numerous API gateways.

The emergence of the AI economy has further highlighted the challenges of digital fragmentation. AI thrives on reliable, secure, and current data, yet too often, this data is fragmented, difficult to govern, and not securely managed; what companies urgently need is a unified, enterprise-scale platform that not only bridges APIs, applications, data, and AI models, but also accelerates digital transformation - and thats Boomi.",AI or Machine Learning
"AlphaFold-3 is out! What's new is that AlphaFold-3 uses diffusion to ""render"" the molecular structure. It starts from a fuzzy cloud of atoms and then materializes the molecule gradually through denoising. We live on a timeline where learnings from Llama and Sora can inform and accelerate life sciences. 

I find this level of generality absolutely mind-boggling. The same transformer+diffusion backbone that generates fancy pixels can also imagine proteins, as long as you convert the data to sequences of floats accordingly.

We are not there yet at a single AGI model, but we have successfully built a menu of general-purpose AI recipes that transfer training techniques, data pipelines, and neural architectures across domains that don't seem related. This should not work, but thank god it does!

"After several months of boring through product development along with the wonderful team at samvid.ai , here is what I can say for sure about building enterprise AI using LLMs. 

1. LLMs are probabilistic beasts and although very powerful, should not be exposed directly to any enterprise user without adequate expertise layers between them. This is our #sootras and #neeyums framework.

2. Building this expertise layer requires all skill sets, not only an understanding of how LLMs work but also classical ML and strong software engineering skills. Yes, the death of software engineering is nowhere in sight. Dont let Devin fool you.

3. Scalability is a real issue. We can all feel excited about long context windows but neither that nor classical RAG will protect you from the stress of spiraling API costs. At samvid.ai , we have achieved success in resolving this issue through our concept of #essence repositories backed up by our #sootras and #neeyums 

Dont buy into the gimmicks of using an LLM out of the box, the end of software engineering or long context windows. Chasing those gimmicks can be fatal.

	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

AI-Centered Company 

	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

	Has multiple core business processes AI-enabled, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

	Has a change management program and employee re-education program to help up-level their knowledge to incorporate AI.

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

"Phew! A breathless day comes to an end in the world of AI. It seems there a two broad camps: one that thinks GPT4o is a big step towards AGI and the other which thinks the live demo was a dud. I subscribe to neither. I have talked about my opinions on the demo itself in a previous post. Let's now get to specifics of how I think this affects our work at samvid.ai

I spent the better part of the day using GPT4o on the kinds of documents we see in our work. As I have mentioned in many other posts, transformers are perception devices and GPT4o is exactly that, the best perception machine in the market. It can now retrieve basic information from unstructured documents with a high degree of accuracy. Old GPT4 was pretty bad at this (why was RAG even a thing given this performance level?) and it took very little to confuse the model. GPT4o is a remarkable improvement on that. However, GPT4o is also showing signs of overfitting. Suppose facts A and B exist in a document with no apparent connection between them. The old GPT4 would have given a McKinsey-like answer with deliberate vagueness about this connection. GPT4o, on the other hand, will go out on a limb and claim there is no relationship between A and B despite the lack of evidence, a fact that may be obviously wrong when evaluated by a domain expert. 

All this is great for samvid.ai . Two thoughts come to mind:
1. My team and I have no interest in spending additional time retrieving basic information from documents. It always seemed like a waste of resources. Would rather focus on higher order problems.
2. The goal of samvid.ai is to unlock the latent knowledge in documents using our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences and use this knowledge for enterprise decision making. Literally nothing about this mission has changed. If anything, our value proposition has gotten stronger. 

It has been a glorious day. Onward and upward.

"The reversal curse is a cognitive bias where machine learning models, specifically language models, struggle to understand the equivalence of statements when their components are reversed.

"As we have always argued at samvid.ai , merely making chunks of a document available as reference to an LLM cannot make answers consistent even with temperature set to zero.

This enables samvid.ai to deliver latent knowledge to decision makers correctly, concisely and consistently.

"With the disbanding of the ""superalignment"" team at OpenAI, there is now doomsday talk of a ""superintelligent"" AI. In my view, ""superintelligent"" AI is the boogeyman that keeps the kids (us) in check. 

With every new release of GPT, I am more convinced that these models are only getting sharper in their perception abilities. I have not seen any real signs of cognition. In our work at samvid.ai , we find that GPT-4o can't even reason at the level of an analyst who has spent 6 months on the job. It can, of course, behave like a rookie analyst who has just graduated from school because it has memorized the textbooks.

The easiest questions / instructions to pose to GPT are either the general (take this spreadsheet and tell me something about it) or the very specific (run a regression on these columns). Anything ambiguous and in-between and even the latest GPT-4o fails miserably. I call this the ""valley of confusion"" of LLMs. But this is where humans excel given their tribal knowledge and experience. True cognitive systems should convert large chunks of this latent human expertise into action while utilizing the LLMs as a way to perceive the world. Our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences are a strong step towards accomplishing this goal.

"CIOs have had it tough for the last decade. Ever increasing pressure to cut costs while technology continued to leapfrog put them in difficult spot. Squeezing run costs to try and keep up with upgrades and piling technological debt has been a fine and difficult balance to say the least.

Finally with the latest breakthroughs in AI, it is feasible to tame Run costs radically beyond the traditional outsourced managed services levers. But it will require companies to adopt AI as integral part of their workforce, not just another tool for more automation. Are CIOs ready for it?

And are we, the entire IT service provider industry braced for the disruption and crash in demand for traditional IT resources if our clients take such a leap of faith.  When 6th graders can write entire applications using Java, Python, and cloud stacks all via AI tools using simple English prompts, programmer demand is set to plummet. With platforms building in GenAI based configuration, demand for functional consultants should decline. Is it going to be all about envisioning and prompt engineering?",AI or Machine Learning

"Have you connected your acquisition campaigns to retention/churn rates? You may be surprised by the results.

A seasoned lifecycle marketer once told me that the key to unlocking retention can often come from the right acquisition strategy.

When peer-to-peer marketplace Mercari US entered the U.S., they faced stiff competition from giants like eBay and Craigslist. They needed a strategy to attract new users and build a community that encouraged return buyers and sellers. To accomplish that, they partnered with GrowthLoop to leverage #BigQuery and activate their predictive models to drive retention. 

Together, GrowthLoop and Mercari....

 Used predictions to identify retention features, and then built out initial segment definitions based on those features. 

 From there, the Mercari team used the results to design and launch experiments with GrowthLoop, refining audiences based on performance

 Mercaris marketing team could now build their own customer lists using predictive models without requiring continuous support from other teams. This drove major retention and revenue lift impacts.

Focusing on churn with data science, automated activation, and consistent experimentation was the key to unlocking retention.

"Every year at The AES Corporation, we celebrate Safety Day. Safety is our first value and top priority, and this week, our AES Utilities in Indiana and Ohio paused and reflected on our Safety legacy to inform how we can execute our work for the future. The AES Utilities use technology and innovation to improve safety practices, which enables us to reliably serve our customers and communities.

At AES Indiana, we recognized the AES Indiana team at Eagle Valley Generating Station on their significant efforts to improve their safety performance through implementing emergency management, designing an outstanding training program, and performing effective audits. In Ohio, we recognized the tireless efforts of AES Ohio crews and contractors for their restoration efforts earlier this spring when storms impacted more than 36,000 customers across the 24-county service territory. In moments like this, we know our customers look to us to get power restored as quickly as possible, and its our responsibility to do this as safely as possible. At AES El Salvador, the immense potential of technology allows us to streamline and make our processes safer, such as using drones for inspecting our distribution grids and applying AI and machine learning to predict and detect unauthorized residential electrical connections.

This week reaffirmed our commitment to employee, contractor and public safety and the commitment we have to each other to ensure each one of us returns home safely at the end of every day, and that is made possible by the hard work and agility of every person who is part of our AES Utilities Team.

"It seems to me that before ""urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us"" we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat.

Such a misplaced sense of urgency reveals an extremely distorted view of reality.
No wonder the more based members of the organization seeked to marginalize the superalignment group.

It's as if someone had said in 1925 ""we urgently need to figure out how to control aircrafts that can transport hundreds of passengers at near the speed of sound over the oceans.""
It would have been difficult to make long-haul passenger jets safe before the turbojet was invented and before any aircraft had crossed the atlantic non-stop.
Yet, we can now fly halfway around the world on twin-engine jets in complete safety. 
It didn't require some sort of magical recipe for safety.
It took decades of careful engineering and iterative refinements.

The process will be similar for intelligent systems.
It will take years for them to get as smart as cats, and more years to get as smart as humans, let alone smarter (don't confuse the superhuman knowledge accumulation and retrieval abilities of current LLMs with actual intelligence).
It will take years for them to be deployed and fine-tuned for efficiency and safety as they are made smarter and smarter.

"Greek philosopher Heraclitus is often tagged as the person who said that ""the only thing constant is change"". 

Change is on my mind lately in different actual sales cycles, circumstances, combinations and permutations as I am getting more heavily involved in AI, ML and ML Ops. 

If you think about AI as a definitive enabling disruption of our time, change management should be top of mind and a priority consideration.

Last week, I managed to visit Workz A/S (a premiere Change Management company) in Copenhagen and through the kindness of my good friend Edoardo Montenegro, I was able to learn more about change management by actually playing one of their very popular strategy board games called hashtag #WallBreakers. This game is a simulation of a merger and acquisition situation of 2 tech companies navigating the difficult task of change, post merger. Thank you also Ask Agger.

5 IMPORTANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Change is hard and complex. Know the WHYs of the change.
2. Sequence and speed of change matters. 
3. Know the players and catalysts of change. 
4. You cannot force change but you can manage & empower it. 
 Start with small strategic wins.
5. Get professional help and an actual playbook.

As I like numbers, I am appreciative of thought leaders like Greg Satell who also writes about change and recently wrote about how a minority in an organisation 25% can be a tipping point number to actually effect organizational change (actual article in the comments below).

AI will be part of every organisation. If you don't have a game plan change management strategy, you will likely have a lot of challenges. 

If you are all in AI instead of just experimenting and ""tinkering"", think about the strategy and how to win over the 25% as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

As change management is a ""human-centered"" practice, we have to really lean into the human side even if the intervention is enabling technology.''

"This week, Google announced a doubling of Gemini Pro 1.5's input context window from 1 million to 2 million tokens, and OpenAI released GPT-4o, which generates tokens 2x faster and 50% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo and natively accepts and generates multimodal tokens. I view these developments as the latest in an 18-month trend, which is shifting prompting best practices for developers as well.

Since ChatGPT's launch in Nov 2022, newer models like GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3-70B have given us better capabilities in two important ways: (i) reasoning, which allows LLMs to think through complex concepts and and follow complex instructions; and (ii) longer input context windows. 

The reasoning capability of advanced models makes them quite good at interpreting complex prompts with detailed instructions. Many people are used to dashing off a quick, 1- to 2-sentence query to an LLM. In contrast, when building applications, I see sophisticated teams frequently write prompts that might be 1 to 2 pages long (my teams call them mega-prompts) that specify in detail how wed like an LLM to perform a task. I still see teams not going far enough in terms of writing detailed instructions. For an example of a moderately lengthy prompt, take a look at Claude 3s system prompt. Its detailed and gives clear guidance for Claude's behavior. 

This is a very different prompting style than we typically use with LLMs web user interfaces, where we might dash off a quick query and, if the response is unsatisfactory, clarify what we want through repeated conversational turns with the chatbot.

The increasing length of input context windows has added another technique to the developers toolkit. GPT-3 kicked off a lot of work on few-shot in-context learning. For example, for text classification, you might give the LLM a handful  say 1 to 5 examples  of texts and their class labels as context. With longer input context windows  GPT-4o accepts 128,000 input tokens, Claude 3 Opus 200,000 tokens, and Gemini 1.5 Pro 1 million tokens (2 million just announced). With many-shot learning, we can give dozens, even hundreds of examples in the prompt, and this works better than few-shot. 

When building complex workflows, I see developers getting good results with this process: 
- Write quick, simple prompts and see how it does.
- Based on where the output falls short, flesh out the prompt iteratively. This  leads to a longer, more detailed, prompt, perhaps even a mega-prompt.
- If thats still insufficient, consider few-shot or many-shot learning (if applicable) or, less frequently, fine-tuning.
- If that still doesnt yield the results you need, break down the task into subtasks and apply an agentic workflow.

If youre interested a deeper dive into prompting strategies, I recommend the Medprompt paper (Nori et al., 2023), which lays out a complex set of prompting strategies.

This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle nudging.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field.

"What a great conference hosted by American Telemedicine Association this year in phoenix.  Delighted to be on an all-star physician panel moderated by Emma Beavins from Fierce Healthcare to break the hype about AI and its use for telemedicine and addressing healthcare workforce issues.

Top takeaways:
- We should keep healthy caution with bringing in #AI to clinicians and patients.  Focus on low risk, high frequency tasks (such as note documentation, scheduling and other clerical burden) as an entry point to build #trust in using AI
- All AI should be vetted to ensure we reduce workload for docs and friction for patients. Not all good ideas should be implemented when we don't have enough clinicians and they are at high risk of burning out.
- Most patients who experience AI now lean into it.  The tech has gotten so sophisticated that patients are enjoying the process when AI gathers info about what brings them into the office before the doc shows up on the telemedicine visit. [ Davis Liu, CMO of Curai Health]
- We must demand transparency for AI at the level of a busy physician.  Use of knowledge maps to link research citations to AI-powered clinical decision support can be done and is being done [Michal Tzuchman Katz, MD CEO of Kahun Medical]
- There is still a massive lack of understanding of what AI is, and why 2024 is different (punchline - the tech is so sophisticated that we can do complex work befitting clinician needs).

"Today marks a career highlight for me. 

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what theyre seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. Im honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsofts LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a whole-slide foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by looking at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and were making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool thatll help that human with a microscope see things they didnt realize were there.

"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
-  Gets trigged from a new hire event
-  Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-   Reasons over data to answer employee questions 
-  Recommends personalized training based on employee background 

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- Orchestration of complex tasks. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks. 
- Memory and context. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time. 
- Monitoring and improving. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks. 
- Delegation with confidence and guardrails. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls. 

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview. 
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

"Thank you, Informatica team, for inviting me to speak at the keynote #informaticaworld2024 this week! I had the opportunity to share the stage with an exceptional host, Richard Ganley (SVP Global partners, Informatica ), and an equally dynamic group of leaders: Jennifer Nacy ( Global IT VP Data, Automation& AI, Jacob Engineering), Parminder Singh( Enterprise Architect, BMC) and Richard Leaton ( Deputy CDO & Data Advisor, Deloitte) a great conversation discussing their Journey of AI adoption.
It was a truly enriching experience to share my team's journey and gain unique insights from the panelists about AI adoption. Each organization's approach to navigating the challenges and uncovering value for its customers and stakeholders was truly inspiring.
It is a unique and humbling experience to be part of the conversation.",AI or Machine Learning
" At Lumos, we raised a $35m Series B from Scale Venture Partners with Andreessen Horowitz, Neo and Harpoon Ventures participating. 

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

"Im excited to announce Powerhouse Ventures newest portfolio company, ThinkLabs AI, Inc., the autonomous grid orchestration copilot.

The electrical grid is becoming more complex to manage as distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewables proliferate. Aging physical infrastructure, increasing extreme weather events, and a retiring utility workforce create a more challenging operating context that threatens utilities ability to reliably provide electricity to their customers. 

ThinkLabs autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.

Powerhouse Ventures is proud to co-lead ThinkLabs $5M Seed with Active Impact Investments, with additional participation from Blackhorn Ventures, Amplify Capital, Mercuria, and a national US energy company. We look forward to working with Founder & CEO Josh Wong and the entire ThinkLabs team to build the digital backbone of the modern grid.

Thanks to Maeve Allsup at Latitude Media and Josh Scott at BetaKit for covering ThinkLabs seed round:

"What do you think about having an AI judge review startups along with human judges in the inaugural ClimaTech Great Global Innovation Challenge? We have posted information on how we are doing this, including the AI prompt, and you can share feedback through the form on this page: https://lnkd.in/ezVnvGiG 

While AI will play a role, our human judges will make the final decisions, ensuring a balanced and fair evaluation process. We're committed to learning from this experience and sharing our insights. Please reach out to me if you are interested in helping with the competition in any way.

Research has demonstrated that ""Data-driven initiatives have been shown to help VC firms reduce gender bias and make better, fairer investment decisions"" (https://lnkd.in/ecfqqgj3). Additionally, ""Machine learning models have already been proven to outperform human investors in deal screening"" (https://lnkd.in/exicBiTR), helping to identify high-potential startups more effectively. By incorporating AI into our evaluation process, we aim to support an objective selection of startups.

As a reminder, applications are due on May 26th. Daniela G., MIT Climate and Energy Prize, #Innovation #AI #Startups #ClimateTech #GlobalChallenge #TechForGood #Sustainability #Climatechlive #MITCEP #MIT #AIJudge #Pitch",AI or Machine Learning
"A new research article just came out that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson. Do you know it?

A market researcher trained in psychometrics was hired in the 80s by Campbell Soup. His task was to help identify the perfect flavor for Prego brand spaghetti sauce (which was getting beat in the market by Ragu). 

Instead of a single, better-than-Ragu sauce, the researcher identified distinct clusters of customer preferences. His results led to the launch of varied sauces like Chunky, Spicy, and Extra Smooth, which, in turn, led to Prego's sales skyrocketing.

In the new article ( https://buff.ly/3wND6Fv ) published just a few days ago, customer satisfaction researchers identified the drivers of satisfaction in airline travel (the specific drivers they uncovered isnt really the point of this post, but you really want to know what they were, right? OK:

	Inflight entertainment
	Seat comfort
	Online booking
	Online support)

The primary interest of the researchers was whether machine learning algorithms beat traditional logistic regression in identifying satisfaction drivers (yes! Random Forest for the win!). 

But Its the secondary finding that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson:

The satisfaction of one segment of customers was most strongly driven by service quality, while another was most strongly driven by amenities.

In my experience, companies often analyze satisfaction feedback across the customer base as a whole. But that approach often averages out distinct segments in a way that ends up reflecting no one!

If you have open-ended customer feedback and want to identify your customers satisfaction drivers, give me a call. I can help. If you dont collect open-ended customer feedback, give me a call, I can help!   carstendhohnke.com
