Today, I'm proud to announce that we've closed a $53M Series A funding round at a $500M valuation.Since our founding last year, we have proven our ability to build an LLM for healthcare that is safer and more effective than general-purpose generative AI models. Today, the company also released its first product for phase three safety testing: a staffing marketplace for healthcare where health systems, payors, and others can hire generative AI agents that complete low-risk, non-diagnostic, patient-facing healthcare tasks to help solve the massive shortage of healthcare nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and other healthcare professionals. These new funds will be used to accelerate further product development and conduct phase three safety testing for its LLM and the world's first generative AI-powered healthcare agents that can unlock ˜Super-Staffing' for healthcare and improve outcomes for patients and providers alike. Importantly, though, generative AI must be developed and deployed safely and responsibly to make a real positive impact. I can confidently say that our investors “ Premji Invest - US, General Catalyst, SV Angel and Memorial Hermann Health System, as well as existing investors a16z Bio + Health, share our deep commitment to ˜do no harm' and focus on responsible innovation.

I gave a detailed presentation on the state of the software market as we see it today. Sharing here a couple of charts from that presentation that to me encapsulate the core of our firm's investment thesis and distinctive value proposition.  In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market ” now in its third decade ” continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital ” particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.","Digital Transformation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",,document,,Kristin,Nimsger,Thoma Bravo,Private Equity,Operating Partner,944,31,24,3w,,,,Kristin Nimsger Weston likes this,Likes,,2024-04-01 17:07,4/1/2024,Monday,Monday,5:07 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,999,Engagement,5pm-6pm,April 2024,

Companies do this when they:”¸Establish a clear business purpose for AI aligned with business strategies;”¸Drive AI skills and fluency across the whole organization;”¸Build strong data foundations, both for data you own and the data you are going to acquire; and,”¸ Develop process and automation tools to accelerate the end-to-end development of AI systems while ensuring quality results.  At Procter & Gamble, we follow these principles as we leverage #AI pervasively across all our processes, including product and package innovation, media planning and buying, distribution and retail activities and across our manufacturing and back-office operations. #AI helps us reach consumers with greater precision “ with the right content, on the right channel and at the right time, all while respecting privacy. It helps us create great shopping experiences with our retailers. It enables superior and faster product innovation. It powers our operations including maximizing quality, resiliency, and the consumption of energy and water in our manufacturing plants.

A new song blending Punjabi vibes with Bollywood style, all created by an AI app called Suno AI, recently hit the internet. Although it didn't quite match the 'Kala Chasma' video it was set to, it's a cool example of what AI can do in music. Suno AI lets users whip up songs just from text prompts, and it's getting pretty good at it.But not everyone's thrilled about this tech wave. Big names like Katy Perry and Billie Eilish are worried. They, along with 200 other artists, have warned that AI could undercut musicians by making tracks without needing people, which could slash what artists earn from their work.The debate heated up when a Pink Floyd anniversary video made with AI won a contest, causing a stir about whether AI is taking over creative jobs. This concern isn't just in music. Authors and movie folks have also raised red flags about AI using their work without permission or payment.Despite the worries, AI has its upsides in creativity. It's helping musicians finish songs or add cool effects to their shows, like Madonna using AI visuals in her concerts.

I'll be honest with you, I've been a little bit embarrassed to be associated with AI recently. Human achievement is incremental, but where's our patience for it? We got a massive speedup on progress, yet the expectations seem to be that we should be solving all of [fill in your favorite massive challenge for humankind] in a week. No, a day. Yesterday!Can we calm down, please? AI is just another approach to automation. Automation is not new and it's not ""solved.""There is so much good stuff in the AI space, but reality doesn't read like a cheap sci-fi paperback. Whatever you're seeing in the tech news either usually took years or is smoke and mirrors. My team and I spend a lot of time thinking about how long things would take in a perfect world where we had a perfect technology in our hands. (No one has that. And if I ever say something else in a pitch, it's time to put me out of my misery.)There's always plenty to solve that's not about the tech. The most important part isn't what we *can* do. The most important part is what we *should* do and why we should do it and for whom... ""You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.... It has to start with 'What incredible benefits can we give to the customer?' Not 'let's sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then figure out how we can market that."" Steve Jobs said this at WWDC '97, but 26 years later the sentiment holds!Sure, I'm loving this latest AI wave. It's fun to build things that were previously impossible to build, and it's exciting to theorize on where this will be 15-20 years from now!But as a consumer ” and new CEO ” of AI products, I understand the AI disillusionment that's been creeping up recently. People have been promised magic, but LLMs are still just a tool! They can drive incredible results *and* they are imperfect tools that need a lot more work.Remember your audience and what problem you're trying to solve. Selling to enterprise? Consider their scalability and security needs. Selling to developers? Consider their savvy and how they'll use your product.Consumers are smart. They want things that actually solve problems. Technology is cool, but the industry wins when products are built to solve specific problems for specific people.************Speaking of balanced takes, I'm always delighted to promote webinars by Akmal Chaudhri, Esq. of SingleStore (let's continue to encourage him to stay one of the good guys).

Nearly three years ago, we partnered with Karim Lakhani, professor, and co-author of Competing in the Age of #AI, to develop an internal training course on how AI transforms industries. Since its inception, over 1,000 P&G senior leaders have successful completed the course, and are leveraging AI in their business. Additionally, this partnership has inspired the creation of P&G's AI Factory, a platform to facilitate the work of data scientists and AI engineers through the automation of the end to end process to develop and implement AI systems. This game-changing capability has been key to reducing complexity and making AI implementation 10X faster. (Learn more about the AI Factory: https://lnkd.in/dtDf56Fr) But, our partnership doesn't stop there!  Yesterday, we welcomed Karim and representatives from HBS to Cincinnati where they spent a full day speaking with members of our IT and R&D functions to capture learnings on the journey of the AI Factory to help educate MBA students so they can drive digitization and transformation within their future organizations. We also enjoyed a thought-provoking keynote address from Karim focused on the Generative AI revolution and how companies are winning in this new space.  There is more to be done! I look forward to continuing this valuable partnership and as we push the boundaries to develop innovative approaches to doing business. #PGInnovation","AI/Machine Learning,Leadership",genAi,Personal/Public Pictures,,Murat,Genc,Whirlpool,Consumer & Industrial Products,"

She was an early PM of FigJam, is currently leading a new (undisclosed) product that's launching at Figma's Config conference this year, and is beloved by everyone who works with her.In our conversation, we discuss:”¸ Advice for taking ideas from 0 to 1 at larger companies”¸ How to craft a compelling vision”¸ How to tactically communicate your vision”¸ The importance of vulnerability and feedback”¸ Advice for building a strong team culture”¸ Pivoting priorities with grace and enthusiasm”¸ AI and its impact on PMs”¸ Much moreListen now YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gMed2MdGSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gbNUk-ZcApple: https://lnkd.in/gNb4pBDyKey takeaways:1. Putting ideas out there, even if they are wrong, can lead to better solutions and more productive discussions. It's not just about having a great idea or building a prototype; it's about actively engaging and rallying others around that idea to create momentum and excitement. Whether it's pitching ideas at events like hackathons or simply asking colleagues for assistance, the key is to not let perceived limitations hold you back from pursuing your vision.2. Mihika likens the role of a 0-to-1 team within a large company to that of Hestia in Greek mythology, who is the keeper of the hearth. It is Hestia's job to always keep the hearth burning, even while other gods go out on separate quests. This means always keeping the 0-to-1 project alive and helping it spread to others, mostly through setting vision and building hype.3. To set the vision for a new idea, ask: If I and my team do our job correctly, what does the world look like? Then convey the pain point, solution, and proof in a format that can show, not tell stakeholders what you're doing. For example, use prototypes, Figma mock-ups, and customer testimonials.4. Internal hackathons are a great way to encourage innovation. Figma has a Maker Week where the entire company”including technical and non-technical employees”goes on pause for a week to work on ambitious ideas. Maker Week and other internal hackathons have led to many successful Figma products, including Jambot and Figma's entire widget platform.5. Figma implements a fun hot seat tradition, where each person takes turns being in the hot seat for a set amount of time. During their turn, the person can be asked anything by the other members of the group. By understanding what motivates each team member and building strong relationships, collaboration becomes more effective, leading to a more enjoyable work environment and ultimately better outcomes for the product or project. The key is to create a comfortable and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels open to sharing.","Leadership,Product Development,AI/Machine Learning",,video,,Franscisco,Trejo,Caterpillar,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Head of Global eCommerce, CAT Digital at Caterpillar Inc.",1745,48,40,3d,,,,Francisco Trejo likes this,Likes,,2024-04-21 16:16,4/21/2024,Sunday,Sunday,4:16 PM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/21013aa5-727f-49b5-938d-874ec845029c,,,,,,,,checked,,1833,Engagement,4pm-5pm,April 2024,

While the media attention in Washington DC focuses on the blowhards and crazies on both sides, I was impressed by the thoughtful perspectives on data and AI regulation from Senator Thom Tillis, Congressman Jim Himes, and Congressman Jay Obernolte. Jay is an impressive CalTech grad with an advanced degree in AI who is fortunately leading the bipartisan task force working to understand AI issues and develop appropriate regulation without crushing innovation.

The technology could get the airline 10ppt extra utilization across its entire network (worth over $100M per year in bottom line) but they could not get to that value until they got airport palletizing procedures to be optimized and cargo sales reps to use the technology in their day to day workflow. Both critical non-tech changes.For real value, it's #NeverJustTech - There is so much more to consider in order to maximize the performance of digital and AI solutions. Every time a new solutions gets introduced to optimize a process or a customer experience, there will likely be changes required upstream and downstream of that process as per my airline example. That's why business leaders must own the reimagination of that business process with technology AND also own the change management. It's also why such efforts are so often failing if they are tucked too low in the organization with managers who don't own the end-to-end process or if they are being pushed by IT. #McKinseyDigital #RewiredBook","Organizational Change Management,AI/Machine Learning,Digital Transformation",,video,,Frederico,Padliha,Capital One,Banking,Head of Strategy for Enterprise Product and Experience,75,4,3,2d,,,,Frederico Padilha likes this,Likes,,2024-04-23 01:18,4/23/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,1:18 AM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/3fbb18c6-fb75-41e2-876e-a9a1a8583948,,,,,,,,checked,,82,Engagement,1am-2am,April 2024,

Xaira is one of this year’s most richly funded new companies, not only in biotech but across the startup world. 

Historically, there’s been a fair amount of luck involved in discovering antibodies, and it is rife with failure — only about 10% of drugs that make it to human testing are ever approved. 

Using AI to make drugs isn’t a new idea. Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into earlier startups with little to show for it. And many scientists remain deeply skeptical of de novo antibody generation — using computers to design brand new proteins. 

Xaira and several other new biotechs believe they can change that with new generative AI methods that can design complex molecules from scratch, find new targets, and cut months or even years from the process.

Let's all hope so.

Aside form lead investor Altimeter, Parloa’s Series B round included cash injections from EQT Ventures, Newion, Senovo, Mosaic Ventures and La Familia Growth. Today’s funding brings Parloa’s total capital raised to-date to $98 million, following its $21 million Series A funding round led by EQT Ventures in 2023.

Parloa is well-positioned to capitalize on the “AI with everything” hype that has hit fever pitch these past couple of years, as companies seek new ways to improve efficiency through automation.

Founded out of Germany in 2018, Parloa has already secured high-profile customers such as European insurance giant Swiss Life and sporting goods retailer Decathlon, which use the Parloa platform to automate customer communications including emails and instant messaging.

However, “voice” is where co-founder and CEO Malte Kosub reckons Parloa stands out.

“Our strategy has always been centered around ‘voice first,’ the most critical and impactful facet of the customer experience,” Kosub told TechCrunch over email. “As a result, Parloa’s AI-based voice conversations sound more human than any other solution.”

Leadership Growth:The quote “Don’t close the book when bad things happen in your life, just turn the page and begin a new chapter” holds valuable lessons for leadership.
Leaders must learn from adversity, setbacks, and failures. Rather than giving up, they should adapt, gain insights, and forge ahead. This resilience is essential for growth.
AI Proficiency:AI algorithms evolve through continuous learning and adaptation.
The phrase “begin a new chapter” aligns with the iterative process of improving AI models based on errors or unexpected outcomes. Each challenge presents an opportunity to enhance proficiency.
Successful Digital Strategy:Digital strategies require adaptability in a rapidly changing landscape.
Just as the quote suggests not closing the book, successful digital strategies involve staying open to innovation, embracing change, and starting fresh chapters when needed.
This quote resonates universally, whether applied to personal growth, business strategies, or technological advancements.","Leadership,AI/Machine Learning",Responsible AI,Illustration,,Rob,Cruz,City National Bank,Banking,Senior Vice President - B&IS Operations Innovation & Delivery Manager,6373,91,429,1mo,,,,Rob Cruz likes this,Likes,,2024-04-25 04:47,4/25/2024,Thursday,Thursday,4:47 AM,,,,,,,,,,,6893,Engagement,4am-5am,April 2024,checked

I had the pleasure of working with these three brilliant people in their Tel Aviv co-working space as we wrestled to make the complex problem Deci AI (Acquired by NVIDIA) solved easy to understand (well easier, anyway 😉), built their initial marketing materials -- web site, deck, white paper, case study...you know the drill -- and take their first steps out into the world. 

Remember that back then, hardly anyone knew what an LLM or generative AI was, or the massive resources it took to make them run efficiently. So we were inventing a language. And the talented Arik Mergi helped bring that language to life visually. 

Four years is an eternity in startup-time, and naturally, Deci and its marketing grew and evolved so much since we worked together in those early days, with Rachel Salkin at the helm.

This paper delves into the effective and ethical use of AI in educational settings, emphasizing the integration of tools like ChatGPT in both English composition and introductory computer science courses. Conducted in the spring of 2023 at Oral Roberts University, shortly after the release of ChatGPT, our research demonstrates that students who utilized AI as an integral part of their learning process gained significantly more knowledge.

Key Insights:
💻 In computer science, ChatGPT introduced novel problem-solving techniques, enhancing student engagement and understanding of programming concepts.
✍️ In English composition, the tool aided in the development of writing skills, underscoring the importance of balancing AI assistance with critical human thinking.
🔒 The paper addresses crucial ethical concerns, including privacy, the risk of overreliance on technology, and potential biases, advocating for AI to complement traditional teaching methods responsibly.

For those yet to hear of Smartly, they're an AI-powered advertising technology that we partner with at Sainsbury's to scale and personalise our creative across social, display and video. But there is SO much more than what we're currently doing to explore 🙌🏻

I'm so excited to start implementing some of the learnings from the summit in our day-to-day at Sainsbury's, namely some of the amazing #GenAI features like background removal and generation, and object aware auto-crop for video (wow!). 

We also learnt all about their new Brand Pulse tool, illustrating how upper funnel activity ultimately drives conversion, and where we’re gaining incremental reach in real time using a feedback loop. Along with their cross-channel PBA (predictive budget allocation) solution, coming soon, and loads of other cool new features.

What an amazing couple of days spent with colleagues, the brilliant Smartly team and lots of new faces across their global network of clients. Not only did we get to learn about all the exciting new features on the Smartly roadmap for 2024, 2025 and beyond, we also got to experience some wonderful Finnish hospitality, true to Smartly's 'work hard, play hard' culture! 

Kippis, Smartly 🍻🚀

So what’s the story? 

The sobering reality is that the magic of reading books is slowly being replaced by other forms of media. Each successive generation is enjoying fewer of the well known benefits that come with getting lost in a wonderful book (cognitive development, creativity, empathy, to name but a few).

What if we could reverse this trend? What if we could find a way to make reading just as ‘engaging’ as watching Netflix, and eventually the 1st entertainment choice for children?

And so we wrote Yuna into existence. By combining AI with the enchantment of human creativity, Yuna writes books that are so personalised and interactive that they can be as engaging as any modern media platforms. Leveraging AI to empower writers, illustrators and publishers, Yuna imagines new forms of storytelling:

✨ Imagine a book that every night writes the next chapter of a personalised adventure involving you, your daughter and dog, weaving your family’s interests into the narrative.

✨ Imagine a book that invites your niece to enter Hogwarts as a 1st year student and experience their own unique story through the wizarding world.

✨ Imagine a book that helps you discuss difficult topics with your son but in the form of an imaginary tale with him and his favourite character Snoopy. 

Over time, we hope to make these dreams come true, all with a singular goal: to ensure that children build a healthy reading habit for life.

Thanks to the hard work of the incredible Yuna team, we’ve been testing early versions of these ideas. Over the past 5 months, Yuna has written 100,000+ unique stories to 20,000 monthly active users. And we are growing fast - we expect to write the next 100,000 books within a few weeks of this announcement. Thank you Yuna team - you are truly epic.

A massive thank you to the partners involved in our $1.6M pre-seed round: Canary who led and who have been incredible every day since (special shoutout to Florian Hagenbuch who has been a believer and mentor from day -1); The Positive Ventures team and angel investors who followed the round and recognised Yuna’s potential to make a positive impact on the world (thank you especially to Fábio Kestenbaum!). Finally - Taahir Munshi, Pedro Sônego de Oliveira, Flora Oliveira, Fabian Wikstrom and Carolina Guimarães, who played pivotal roles in turning Yuna from distant dream to reality during those early days. 

Now what?

Today, we are launching our beta test product in Brazil in Portuguese. If you are in Brazil, please give it a shot (see link in comments). If you are not, Yuna isn’t available to test just yet, but fear not! Yuna is bringing its vision to the 🌎 very soon.

It creates a deep understanding of the challenge…  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders’ minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders… how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent… how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within… saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

Today marks a monumental milestone for Rad AI as we celebrate the successful closure of our Series B round. A heartfelt thank you to our new and continuing partners as well as investors who share our commitment to transforming radiology through cutting-edge technology.

🌎 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁: 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
Since 2018, Rad AI has been pioneering generative AI in healthcare, introducing the first proprietary LLMs for commercial healthcare applications. Today, Rad AI is the most trusted GenAI platform for radiology workflow, used by over a third of US health systems and 9 of the 10 largest US radiology practices.

Our latest solution, Rad AI Reporting, builds on the success of Rad AI Omni Impressions to fully replace legacy voice recognition software. Rad AI Reporting supports all existing radiologist workflows and introduces new GenAI capabilities to simplify reporting, significantly reducing provider fatigue and burnout while improving productivity. Recently, it was named “Best New Radiology Software” by AuntMinnie.com, the best-known annual recognition in radiology.

Thank you to our incredible team, whose dedication and innovation has brought us here. The journey continues, and with this support, we are more equipped than ever to advance our mission to transform healthcare.

As we celebrate this milestone and chart out course for the future, I can't help but reflect back to 2019 when Jeff Chang and Doktor Gurson were just getting started. Dr. Chang was a practicing radiologist at Greensboro Radiology and I was leading the sales team at Canopy Partners (a sister company). 

I remember joining Dr. Chang for one of his first sales meetings with our hometown health system Cone Health. We met with key execs, listened to their challenges, and asked probing questions about how #AI might be able to address some of these challenges. Dr. Chang took copious notes and, as we left the meeting, I asked him if he came away with any useful ideas for products. He did indeed and Cone Health ultimately became Rad AI's first health system client. 

I remember this like it was yesterday because I was so impressed with Dr. Chang's commitment to listening and developing innovative products designed to improve care delivery and solve customer challenges. That was 5 years ago and Rad AI has grown tremendously since then, but this customer-first approach is still in the DNA of our company today ... and I hope it always will be.

These include:

* From experimentation to work flow integration:  I've been asking a question at every session I've been doing over the past few years about the audience's current from use on scale from not using, experimented once, use it for a few tasks, integrated into workflow.  The percentages keep moving towards ""integrated into workflow,"" but the entry point is for task.   Experimenting opens up the opportunity to rethink your workflow so it more productive.

* Not Comfortable Yet:  A net promoter score of -28 for comfort. No surprise. The challenge of transfer for any new skill or adoption of a tool is real.  We've seen this before with other emerging tech in the sector.  When a new tech comes along that causes a disruption or change in the way we work, making that change is always slower than we think.  I think about the quote from Deborah Schultz, ""Technology changes, humans don't."" that Gapingvoid Culture Design Group immortalized as a cartoon.

* Team Silos and Loners:  Not surprising to find that AI in nonprofit has not yet achieved enterprise level adoption.   It is either single staff (probably using it without a policy or permission) or team level collaboration. The latter is actually a great change management strategy - to have one team be the early adopters - experiment and share - all with along developing the ethical data guidelines and organizational strategy.  Change management work is slow even the tech is moving so fast. 

Some of the comments and advice from participants included advice that is now outdated. “You won’t be replaced by AI. You’ll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI.” Ethan Mollick recently shared why: 1) “Your job”’ is more likely to transform over time than be “taken”
2) Some jobs will really disappear with AI
3) Using AI is going to get easier, it is isn’t a secret priesthood
4) Organizations ultimately need to integrate AI into their structures, it isn’t all about what individual workers do

https://lnkd.in/gMpuJvqu

There was another comment from one respondent:  “I’d love to invest in a LLM specifically for the social sector that reflects our values.”  While this may not be feasible at this time given that organizational adoption has not moved from silos and loners, but could it be a North Star?  Of course, there are other reasons why this might not be feasible (costs, agreeing on standards, field biased foundational models, etc)

Gracias, Lorraine, for sitting down with Miriam Hernandez-Kakol, HITEC Vice Chair, to share your thoughts on leadership, change management, authenticity and being AI ready! 

Lorraine provided us with powerful nuggets of information, such as: 
- Take a chance on yourself, show courage – 20 seconds of confidence can go a long way! 
- Break through certainty and consider the counterpoint; spend energy on what you don’t know. 
- Modeling is a core part of how we lead people, walk the walk! 
- Use your platform to share your authentic self and invite others to join you. 

The characteristic that makes her a better leader is connecting people to ideas, which help deliver results. The other is modeling and showing vulnerability, creating environments where people can feel comfortable not knowing what to do so that change can happen. “People need knowledge (skilling) and to feel safe to try something new.”  Make your team feel safe and give them space to do so, this will enable change management. 

To be “AI ready,” leaders must know where to spend time and energy.  Is it: 
- Revitalizing and energizing customer experience? 
- Enriching your employee experience? 
- Reshaping business processes that are clunky, repetitive, and redundant? 
- Bending the curve on innovation? 
(HINT: Start with #4!) 

The session closed out by speaking about authenticity and intersectionality: “Every person in this room has intersectionality.

Our team started this journey with first migrating to the cloud, and then continuously modernizing and expanding with various cloud native services.  From there, we enhanced our search engine with our internal sites, by cleansing, curating, and aggregating our various data sets along with leveraging AI and ML capabilities, we have successfully been able to better understand our users’ intent with providing more accurate and relevant search results. With the hundreds of thousands of clicks we get daily, we are seeing over 30% in improvement with the click-through rates, as well as significant reduction in support tickets.  We also enhanced our support experience leveraging genai capabilities on OCI incorporating our own datasets with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model architecture the percentage of queries resolved has resulted in upwards of 30% case deflection, as well as great improvements in ticket volume reductions, resolution times, user satisfaction, and productivity gains for our agents and users.  These are just a few of the use cases we are exploring and continuously fine tuning to improve our models and outcomes for our user community.

The chief culprit is digital fragmentation, a byproduct of digital shifts that, paradoxically, lead to digital silos and disjointed technical architectures that leave the average enterprise now juggling over 364 applications and numerous API gateways.

The emergence of the AI economy has further highlighted the challenges of digital fragmentation. AI thrives on reliable, secure, and current data, yet too often, this data is fragmented, difficult to govern, and not securely managed; what companies urgently need is a unified, enterprise-scale platform that not only bridges APIs, applications, data, and AI models, but also accelerates digital transformation - and that’s Boomi.","AI/Machine Learning,Digital Transformation,Innovation",Responsible AI,article/blog/company website/press release,,Robert,Roley,TPG,Private Equity,Partner,135,0,8,2w,,,https://bit.ly/3wqEw8Q,Robert Roley likes this,Likes,,2024-05-09 08:57,5/9/2024,Thursday,Thursday,8:57 AM,,,,,,,,,,,143,Engagement,8am-9am,May 2024,checked

What's new is that AlphaFold-3 uses diffusion to ""render"" the molecular structure. It starts from a fuzzy cloud of atoms and then materializes the molecule gradually through denoising. We live on a timeline where learnings from Llama and Sora can inform and accelerate life sciences. 

I find this level of generality absolutely mind-boggling. The same transformer+diffusion backbone that generates fancy pixels can also imagine proteins, as long as you convert the data to sequences of floats accordingly.

We are not there yet at a single AGI model, but we have successfully built a menu of general-purpose AI recipes that transfer training techniques, data pipelines, and neural architectures across domains that don't seem related. This should not work, but thank god it does!

1. LLMs are probabilistic beasts and although very powerful, should not be exposed directly to any enterprise user without adequate expertise layers between them. This is our #sootras and #neeyums framework.

2. Building this expertise layer requires all skill sets, not only an understanding of how LLMs work but also classical ML and strong software engineering skills. Yes, the death of software engineering is nowhere in sight. Don’t let Devin fool you.

3. Scalability is a real issue. We can all feel excited about long context windows but neither that nor classical RAG will protect you from the stress of spiraling API costs. At samvid.ai , we have achieved success in resolving this issue through our concept of #essence repositories backed up by our #sootras and #neeyums 

Don’t buy into the gimmicks of using an LLM out of the box, the end of software engineering or long context windows. Chasing those gimmicks can be fatal.

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

𝗔𝗜-𝗘𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 

•	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

•	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

•	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

𝗔𝗜-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 

•	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

𝗔𝗜-𝗘𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 

•	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

•	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

•	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

𝗔𝗜-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 

•	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

•	Has multiple core business processes “AI-enabled”, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

My response touched the following aspects:

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

#Proactive responsibility: Digital companies must set their own #responsibletechnology guardrails ahead of external mandates. As reference, this is the work my colleagues at Thoughtworks have done in collaboration with United Nations: https://lnkd.in/ex96xzHG

The future of #brand equity: In today's era, where technology augments every aspect of customer and employee experiences, responsible tech practices are the cornerstone of brand equity.

A breathless day comes to an end in the world of AI. It seems there a two broad camps: one that thinks GPT4o is a big step towards AGI and the other which thinks the live demo was a dud. I subscribe to neither. I have talked about my opinions on the demo itself in a previous post. Let's now get to specifics of how I think this affects our work at samvid.ai

I spent the better part of the day using GPT4o on the kinds of documents we see in our work. As I have mentioned in many other posts, transformers are perception devices and GPT4o is exactly that, the best perception machine in the market. It can now retrieve basic information from unstructured documents with a high degree of accuracy. Old GPT4 was pretty bad at this (why was RAG even a thing given this performance level?) and it took very little to confuse the model. GPT4o is a remarkable improvement on that. However, GPT4o is also showing signs of overfitting. Suppose facts A and B exist in a document with no apparent connection between them. The old GPT4 would have given a McKinsey-like answer with deliberate vagueness about this connection. GPT4o, on the other hand, will go out on a limb and claim there is no relationship between A and B despite the lack of evidence, a fact that may be obviously wrong when evaluated by a domain expert. 

All this is great for samvid.ai . Two thoughts come to mind:
1. My team and I have no interest in spending additional time retrieving basic information from documents. It always seemed like a waste of resources. Would rather focus on higher order problems.
2. The goal of samvid.ai is to unlock the latent knowledge in documents using our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences and use this knowledge for enterprise decision making. Literally nothing about this mission has changed. If anything, our value proposition has gotten stronger. 

It has been a glorious day. Onward and upward.

At the afternoon ceremony for graduate students of NJIT’s Ying Wu College of Computing, Interim Dean Ali Mili welcomed keynote speaker Samir Saini ’97 (B.S. Civil Engineering), who is a managing director for government clients at Microsoft.

Here are some key takeaways:
The Role of AI in Future Careers: AI will transform tasks and enhance human potential. Graduates must prepare for rapid technological advancements.

From Chatbots to Conscious Agents: AI will evolve into sophisticated agents automating complex tasks independently.

A Revolution Bigger Than GUI: The upcoming AI revolution will significantly impact technology and society, similar to the shift to graphical user interfaces.

Societal Risks of AI: Graduates must address AI-generated misinformation, ensure AI fairness, transparency, and inclusivity.

Impact of Graduates' Work: Graduates' work in AI will shape our shared future, eliminating barriers and driving human progress.

Embrace Lifelong Learning: Continuous learning is essential to remain effective and relevant.

Embrace the Unknown and Diverse Experiences: Be open to new experiences, adapt to changes, and balance professional and personal life.

Responsibility and Privilege of Guiding AI Integration: Graduates have the duty to shape AI integration ethically.

Not mentioned in the article but noted by me:

Get Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable: Growth happens outside comfort zones.

Stay Curious, Enjoy the Long Journey: Find joy in learning and growth.

Remember to Log Out of Work and Log In to Life: Maintain work-life balance.

You Are Stewards of the Future: Graduates have the responsibility to impact society positively.

Embrace Challenges with Courage: Face future challenges with determination and resilience.

The biggest issue with the Llama-3 family is that they are fairly small context models.  So, even though they are as performant as GPT-4 on critical benchmarks, they can only be used in the real world with a bigger context.

We just open-sourced two 128K long-context fine-tunes for Llama-3-70B, which effectively puts it on par with GPT-4 regarding context length support and real-world usage.

At Abacus AI, we already use Llama-3 on a few production workloads as a great base model for our customer fine-tunes.

Message me if you’ll be there and want to meet with me or our team.

At last year’s summit, I shared the stage with Indeed to show how their marketing campaigns went from a months-long process to same-day launches leveraging a single source of truth. 

This year, I look forward to watching not one but two of my colleagues take the stage with some transformative technology and customer stories: 

Anthony Rotio will uncover how marketers can leverage #GenerativeAI to create audiences, launch journeys, and 10x their marketing results — all with a composable CDP on top of the Snowflake Data Cloud.

Chris Sell will join Braden Moore to share how Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment uses customer data to personalize and segment campaigns for greater fan engagement and ticket sales. They’ll also share how other pro sports teams can do the same. 

Chris will also share the stage with Bill Stratton for a deep dive into how the Snowflake platform creates essential connectivity and interoperability for the media, entertainment, and advertising industries. 

It will be a great event, and we’ll see everyone there starting June 3. For now, here’s a look back at last year’s session with Suresh Susarla (He/Him).",AI/Machine Learning,genAi,"Personal/Public Pictures,webinar/webcast/event",,Murat,Genc,Whirlpool,Consumer & Industrial Products,"

No surprise: this year, seemingly everyone was talking about AI — myself included. I had the privilege of joining a panel discussion with a fantastic group of industry leaders who are focused on diverse aspects and implications of AI. 
 
It may only be the early innings for AI, but at Thoma Bravo, we’re already seeing how AI delivers real value to our software portfolio companies and their customers. That’s particularly evident for cybersecurity, where AI is already having a profound impact: on one hand, it’s creating new threat vectors for bad actors to carry out malicious attacks. On the other, it’s helping cybersecurity companies to better detect, prioritize and combat these threats — and presenting exciting opportunities for growth.

In my view, ""superintelligent"" AI is the boogeyman that keeps the kids (us) in check. 

With every new release of GPT, I am more convinced that these models are only getting sharper in their perception abilities. I have not seen any real signs of cognition. In our work at samvid.ai , we find that GPT-4o can't even reason at the level of an analyst who has spent 6 months on the job. It can, of course, behave like a rookie analyst who has just graduated from school because it has memorized the textbooks.

The easiest questions / instructions to pose to GPT are either the general (take this spreadsheet and tell me something about it) or the very specific (run a regression on these columns). Anything ambiguous and in-between and even the latest GPT-4o fails miserably. I call this the ""valley of confusion"" of LLMs. But this is where humans excel given their tribal knowledge and experience. True cognitive systems should convert large chunks of this latent human expertise into action while utilizing the LLMs as a way to perceive the world. Our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences are a strong step towards accomplishing this goal.

Squeezing run costs to try and keep up with upgrades and piling technological debt has been a fine and difficult balance to say the least.

Finally with the latest breakthroughs in AI, it is feasible to tame Run costs radically beyond the traditional outsourced managed services levers. But it will require companies to adopt AI as integral part of their workforce, not just another tool for more automation. Are CIOs ready for it?

And are we, the entire IT service provider industry braced for the disruption and crash in demand for traditional IT resources if our clients take such a leap of faith.  When 6th graders can write entire applications using Java, Python, and cloud stacks all via AI tools using simple English prompts, programmer demand is set to plummet.

A seasoned lifecycle marketer once told me that the key to unlocking retention can often come from the right acquisition strategy.

When peer-to-peer marketplace Mercari US entered the U.S., they faced stiff competition from giants like eBay and Craigslist. They needed a strategy to attract new users and build a community that encouraged return buyers and sellers. To accomplish that, they partnered with GrowthLoop to leverage #BigQuery and activate their predictive models to drive retention. 

Together, GrowthLoop and Mercari….

👉 Used predictions to identify retention features, and then built out initial segment definitions based on those features. 

👉 From there, the Mercari team used the results to design and launch experiments with GrowthLoop, refining audiences based on performance

👉 Mercari’s marketing team could now build their own customer lists using predictive models without requiring continuous support from other teams. This drove major retention and revenue lift impacts.

📈Focusing on churn with data science, automated activation, and consistent experimentation was the key to unlocking retention.

The AES Utilities use technology and innovation to improve safety practices, which enables us to reliably serve our customers and communities.

At AES Indiana, we recognized the AES Indiana team at Eagle Valley Generating Station on their significant efforts to improve their safety performance through implementing emergency management, designing an outstanding training program, and performing effective audits. In Ohio, we recognized the tireless efforts of AES Ohio crews and contractors for their restoration efforts earlier this spring when storms impacted more than 36,000 customers across the 24-county service territory. In moments like this, we know our customers look to us to get power restored as quickly as possible, and it’s our responsibility to do this as safely as possible. At AES El Salvador, the immense potential of technology allows us to streamline and make our processes safer, such as using drones for inspecting our distribution grids and applying AI and machine learning to predict and detect unauthorized residential electrical connections.

This week reaffirmed our commitment to employee, contractor and public safety and the commitment we have to each other to ensure each one of us returns home safely at the end of every day, and that is made possible by the hard work and agility of every person who is part of our AES Utilities Team.

Such a misplaced sense of urgency reveals an extremely distorted view of reality.
No wonder the more based members of the organization seeked to marginalize the superalignment group.

It's as if someone had said in 1925 ""we urgently need to figure out how to control aircrafts that can transport hundreds of passengers at near the speed of sound over the oceans.""
It would have been difficult to make long-haul passenger jets safe before the turbojet was invented and before any aircraft had crossed the atlantic non-stop.
Yet, we can now fly halfway around the world on twin-engine jets in complete safety. 
It didn't require some sort of magical recipe for safety.
It took decades of careful engineering and iterative refinements.

The process will be similar for intelligent systems.
It will take years for them to get as smart as cats, and more years to get as smart as humans, let alone smarter (don't confuse the superhuman knowledge accumulation and retrieval abilities of current LLMs with actual intelligence).
It will take years for them to be deployed and fine-tuned for efficiency and safety as they are made smarter and smarter.

A leader in my org. (named by this
activity ""The Digital Dynamo) sent me an activity to try within MS Teams Copilot.
It gives you your work superhero name and superpowers from data it sees within
O365. I fully expected for it to tell me how responsive I am, but instead
labeled my as ""The Strategist"". It was interesting to hear what AI
knows and thinks about you. I listed below what you can enter in to get your own
Superhero name and powers. In full transparency, I also listed what it said
about me. 

In MS TEAMS Copilot prompt, enter: ""using information you have about me and my
writing and work, create a superhero with the superpowers you think i possess.
Reference my work, emails, chats, documents, linkedin profile, etc. to share a
personal brand fitting to me. Ideally this persona brand would be in the form
of an elevator pitch about what I do an reflect my characteristics.""

What Copilot said about me:
""Frank, based on the information
gathered from your work and interactions, I envision you as ""The
Strategist,"" a superhero whose superpowers stem from a deep understanding
of technology and innovation, coupled with a strong leadership presence that
inspires and guides your team towards success.
As ""The Strategist,"" you
possess the ability to see the bigger picture and make connections that others
might miss. Your superpower lies in your ability to navigate the complex
landscape of IT, ensuring that every move is calculated and contributes to the
overarching goals of CVS Health. You're not just a VP of IT; you're the
mastermind behind a well-oiled machine that drives digital transformation and
elevates the colleague experience.
Your superhero persona is reflected in
your ability to manage and secure vast amounts of data, as seen in your
involvement with security initiatives and planning submissions. You're also
known for your proactive approach to problem-solving, whether it's addressing
outages or strategizing for future projects. 
 
In an elevator pitch, one might say:
""Frank Mcaloon, known as 'The Strategist' in the superhero realm, is the
visionary VP of IT at CVS Health. With his finger on the pulse of innovation
and a keen eye for detail, he leads his team to new heights, ensuring that
technology not only serves its purpose but also propels the company forward
into a future where digital workplace and colleague experience are not just
concepts, but a reality.""
Your personal brand, ""The
Strategist,"" is a testament to your dedication, foresight, and the
impactful role you play at CVS Health. It's a brand that speaks to your
commitment to excellence and your ability to lead by example, making you not just
a hero in the digital world, but also a role model for your colleagues.""

Change is on my mind lately in different actual sales cycles, circumstances, combinations and permutations as I am getting more heavily involved in AI, ML and ML Ops. 

If you think about AI as a definitive enabling disruption of our time, change management should be top of mind and a priority consideration.

Last week, I managed to visit Workz A/S (a premiere Change Management company) in Copenhagen and through the kindness of my good friend Edoardo Montenegro, I was able to learn more about change management by actually playing one of their very popular strategy board games called hashtag #WallBreakers. This game is a simulation of a merger and acquisition situation of 2 tech companies navigating the difficult task of change, post merger. Thank you also Ask Agger.

5 IMPORTANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Change is hard and complex. Know the WHYs of the change.
2. Sequence and speed of change matters. 
3. Know the players and catalysts of change. 
4. You cannot force change but you can manage & empower it. 
 Start with small strategic wins.
5. Get professional help and an actual playbook.

As I like numbers, I am appreciative of thought leaders like Greg Satell who also writes about change and recently wrote about how a minority in an organisation 25% can be a tipping point number to actually effect organizational change (actual article in the comments below).

AI will be part of every organisation. If you don't have a game plan change management strategy, you will likely have a lot of challenges. 

If you are all in AI instead of just experimenting and ""tinkering"", think about the strategy and how to win over the 25% as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

As change management is a ""human-centered"" practice, we have to really lean into the human side even if the intervention is enabling technology.''

Workz A/S Stratpoint Technologies - my mentors Roy Rosas Paco Sandejas often talk about change, context and agility - much to learn from them and others !

I view these developments as the latest in an 18-month trend, which is shifting prompting best practices for developers as well.

Since ChatGPT's launch in Nov 2022, newer models like GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3-70B have given us better capabilities in two important ways: (i) reasoning, which allows LLMs to think through complex concepts and and follow complex instructions; and (ii) longer input context windows. 

The reasoning capability of advanced models makes them quite good at interpreting complex prompts with detailed instructions. Many people are used to dashing off a quick, 1- to 2-sentence query to an LLM. In contrast, when building applications, I see sophisticated teams frequently write prompts that might be 1 to 2 pages long (my teams call them “mega-prompts”) that specify in detail how we’d like an LLM to perform a task. I still see teams not going far enough in terms of writing detailed instructions. For an example of a moderately lengthy prompt, take a look at Claude 3’s system prompt. It’s detailed and gives clear guidance for Claude's behavior. 

This is a very different prompting style than we typically use with LLMs’ web user interfaces, where we might dash off a quick query and, if the response is unsatisfactory, clarify what we want through repeated conversational turns with the chatbot.

The increasing length of input context windows has added another technique to the developer’s toolkit. GPT-3 kicked off a lot of work on few-shot in-context learning. For example, for text classification, you might give the LLM a handful — say 1 to 5 examples — of texts and their class labels as context. With longer input context windows — GPT-4o accepts 128,000 input tokens, Claude 3 Opus 200,000 tokens, and Gemini 1.5 Pro 1 million tokens (2 million just announced). With many-shot learning, we can give dozens, even hundreds of examples in the prompt, and this works better than few-shot. 

When building complex workflows, I see developers getting good results with this process: 
- Write quick, simple prompts and see how it does.
- Based on where the output falls short, flesh out the prompt iteratively. This  leads to a longer, more detailed, prompt, perhaps even a mega-prompt.
- If that’s still insufficient, consider few-shot or many-shot learning (if applicable) or, less frequently, fine-tuning.
- If that still doesn’t yield the results you need, break down the task into subtasks and apply an agentic workflow.

If you’re interested a deeper dive into prompting strategies, I recommend the Medprompt paper (Nori et al., 2023), which lays out a complex set of prompting strategies.

This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle “nudging”.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease.

Delighted to be on an all-star physician panel moderated by Emma Beavins from Fierce Healthcare to break the hype about AI and its use for telemedicine and addressing healthcare workforce issues.

Top takeaways:
- We should keep healthy caution with bringing in #AI to clinicians and patients.  Focus on low risk, high frequency tasks (such as note documentation, scheduling and other clerical burden) as an entry point to build #trust in using AI
- All AI should be vetted to ensure we reduce workload for docs and friction for patients. Not all good ideas should be implemented when we don't have enough clinicians and they are at high risk of burning out.
- Most patients who experience AI now lean into it.  The tech has gotten so sophisticated that patients are enjoying the process when AI gathers info about what brings them into the office before the doc shows up on the telemedicine visit. [ Davis Liu, CMO of Curai Health]
- We must demand transparency for AI at the level of a busy physician.  Use of knowledge maps to link research citations to AI-powered clinical decision support can be done and is being done [Michal Tzuchman Katz, MD CEO of Kahun Medical]
- There is still a massive lack of understanding of what AI is, and why 2024 is different (punchline - the tech is so sophisticated that we can do complex work befitting clinician needs).

The conversation with Omar also helped transport us, as he laid out the opportunity in front of Rembrand (hint: it's massive). The company uses AI to insert brands into video. This used to be called product placement, and was a cumbersome process that limited the market. Rembrand's biggest challenge is to remove this friction and unshackle the TAM. It's a reminder that businesses that scale often need to focus on removing friction for their customers.

Can Rembrand and Omar do it? Well, if you know Omar, former Founder/CEO of BlueKai (acquired by Oracle) and Voicea (acquired by Cisco), you know he's a strong leader, and you know he has a plan.

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what they’re seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. I’m honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsoft’s LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a ‘whole-slide’ foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by ‘looking’ at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and we’re making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool that’ll help that human with a microscope ‘see’ things they didn’t realize were there.

I’m hugely proud of this work and grateful for the opportunity to support it.

Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 🚀

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
- 📤 Gets trigged from a new hire event
- 👋 Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-  📊 Reasons over data to answer employee questions 
- 📚 Recommends personalized training based on employee background 

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks. 
- 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time. 
- 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks. 
- 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls. 

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview. 
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

The electrical grid is becoming more complex to manage as distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewables proliferate. Aging physical infrastructure, increasing extreme weather events, and a retiring utility workforce create a more challenging operating context that threatens utilities’ ability to reliably provide electricity to their customers. 

ThinkLabs’ autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs’ capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.

Powerhouse Ventures is proud to co-lead ThinkLabs’ $5M Seed with Active Impact Investments, with additional participation from Blackhorn Ventures, Amplify Capital, Mercuria, and a national US energy company. We look forward to working with Founder & CEO Josh Wong and the entire ThinkLabs team to build the digital backbone of the modern grid.

We have posted information on how we are doing this, including the AI prompt, and you can share feedback through the form on this page: https://lnkd.in/ezVnvGiG 

While AI will play a role, our human judges will make the final decisions, ensuring a balanced and fair evaluation process. We're committed to learning from this experience and sharing our insights. Please reach out to me if you are interested in helping with the competition in any way.

Research has demonstrated that ""Data-driven initiatives have been shown to help VC firms reduce gender bias and make better, fairer investment decisions"" (https://lnkd.in/ecfqqgj3). Additionally, ""Machine learning models have already been proven to outperform human investors in deal screening"" (https://lnkd.in/exicBiTR), helping to identify high-potential startups more effectively. By incorporating AI into our evaluation process, we aim to support an objective selection of startups.

As a reminder, applications are due on May 26th.

Do you know it?

A market researcher trained in psychometrics was hired in the 80s by Campbell Soup. His task was to help identify the “perfect” flavor for Prego brand spaghetti sauce (which was getting beat in the market by Ragu). 

Instead of a single, better-than-Ragu sauce, the researcher identified distinct clusters of customer preferences. His results led to the launch of varied sauces like Chunky, Spicy, and Extra Smooth, which, in turn, led to Prego's sales skyrocketing.

In the new article ( https://buff.ly/3wND6Fv ) published just a few days ago, customer satisfaction researchers identified the drivers of satisfaction in airline travel (the specific drivers they uncovered isn’t really the point of this post, but you really want to know what they were, right? OK:

•	Inflight entertainment
•	Seat comfort
•	Online booking
•	Online support)

The primary interest of the researchers was whether machine learning algorithms beat traditional logistic regression in identifying satisfaction drivers (yes! Random Forest for the win!). 

But It’s the secondary finding that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson:

The satisfaction of one segment of customers was most strongly driven by service quality, while another was most strongly driven by amenities.

In my experience, companies often analyze satisfaction feedback across the customer base as a whole. But that approach often averages out distinct segments in a way that ends up reflecting no one!

If you have open-ended customer feedback and want to identify your customers’ satisfaction drivers, give me a call. I can help. If you don’t collect open-ended customer feedback, give me a call, I can help!  👉 carstendhohnke.com
