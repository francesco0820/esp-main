"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not AI or Machine Learning
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.

"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not AI or Machine Learning

"There is a special club that no parent ever wants to join""the one where you have lost a child. There is an even smaller club for parents who have lost a child to suicide. While parents who have lost a child to a physical illness openly talk about it, when a parent loses a child to suicide, it is spoken about in hushed tones.What is the difference between losing a child to a physical illness compared to a mental illness? How it is spoken about! But why? They are both illnesses. When I lost my son, Langdon, to suicide, I made a promise to myself and to Langdon that I wouldn't speak in hushed tones.In the last almost 2  12 years since Langdon's death, I have been asked to speak to a friend of a friend or the sibling of a friend who has lost a child to suicide more times than should be allowed. Because of this and because of Langdon, I have changed the direction of my life to helping those who suffer from mental health issues or those who care for them.Why am I posting this today? Today is Langdon's 23rd birthday, and I know he would not want someone to have to talk in hushed tones or feel alone. I don't know who said this, but there are many Suicide loss survivors who need to hear this.

"Ys Achieved Amazon Ads Retail Certification! YsE-commerce and retail media, in particular, have grown incredibly over the past couple of years. At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible. I loved diving deep into the Amazon Ads Retail Certification course where I learned about retail readiness, Amazon's fulfillment solutions, the different aspects of selling on Amazon.com, how to launch a new product on Amazon.com, as well as, navigating Seller Central and Vendor Central.

"Let's recap what appears to be complete BS against Trump. The man wins an election against an unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton
. They pay for a fake dossier and claim it's not the American people who elected him but the Russians. A Special Counsel is appointed, millions of dollars are spent, and the conclusion is that there was never any collusion between Trump and the Russians. It was the American people who elected him. It was complete BS.

Once in the White House, a woman writes a memoir and claims Trump sexually assaulted her several decades ago. Trump says no, I never did what she is accusing me of. New York then changes the law so she could bring charges decades after. She's actually unable to provide any direct evidence because she waited decades to report the alleged assault. The case proceeds anyway; eventually, after back and forth, Trump has to pay her millions of dollars for defamation. In interviews, she says she can't wait to receive the money so that she can go shopping worldwide. She also says the sexual assault was never sexual; claims rape is sexy. The media ignores the inconsistencies because that's not what the so-called deep state wants.

A porn actress also comes out and says she had an affair with Trump decades ago, and Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. The government says, wow! That's such huge information, had the American people known that they would have elected Clinton. Several people say there's no case to be made there; eventually, the case goes to court with the government claiming that he did not specifically disclose that the legal fee was somehow a campaign contribution. Anyway, they convict Trump. Meanwhile, the porn industry exploits all these women and men, paying them only a small fee once to shoot their movies and using them for decades without ever paying them any other fee. One would think a government that cares about porn actresses would try to help them and stop the exploitation. No, they actually don't care.

I can go on and on. When junior journalists receive information from the government in the form of indictments, they often believe everything the government says, that they are just there trying to punish deadly criminals in society, that they are trying to stop a dangerous guy. Meanwhile, the so-called dangerous man has not done all the atrocities others have done in terms of laws that punish ordinary people, including some based on their race, and bombs all over the world that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Of course, Trump is not a perfect man. People attack him; he also attacks people, and so do you.

But the false claim that he's the worst American to have ever lived and that now he's akin to Adolf Hitler and if he's re-elected again, doom and gloom would envelop the United States are simply false. Now they are claiming that he's so crazy he might attack Biden on stage on June 27 when they debate in Atlanta next week. The hypocrisy is really disgusting.

"Modeling the world for action by generating pixel is as wasteful and doomed to failure as the largely-abandoned idea of ""analysis by synthesis"".Decades ago, there was a big debate in ML about the relative advantages of generative methods vs discriminative methods for classification.Learning theorists, such as Vapnik, argued against generative methods, pointing out that training a generative modeling was a way more difficult than classification (from the sample complexity standpoint).Regardless, a whole community in computer vision was arguing that recognition should work by generating pixels from explanatory latent variables. At inference time, one would infer the configuration of latent variables that generated the observed pixels.The inference method would use optimization: e.g. use a 3D model of an object and try to find the pose parameters that reproduce the image.This never quite worked, and it was very slow.Later, some people converted to the Bayesian religion and tried to use Bayesian inference for the latent (e.g. using variational approximations and/or sampling).At some point, when Non-Parametric Bayes and Latent Dirichlet Allocation became the rage in text modeling, some folks heroically attempted to apply that to object recognition from images.>>> THIS WAS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE <<<If your goal is to train a world model for recognition or planning, using pixel-level prediction is a terrible idea.Generation happens to work for text because text is discrete with a finite number of symbols. Dealing with uncertainty in the prediction is easy in such settings. Dealing with prediction uncertainty in high-dimension continuous sensory inputs is simply intractable. That's why generative models for sensory inputs are doomed to failure.",Not AI or Machine Learning

"This year, we celebrate a monumental milestoneBel Fuse Inc.'s 75th anniversary! Founded by my grandfather and now led by my father, Dan Bernstein as CEO, Bel Fuse stands as a testament to enduring success and unwavering commitment to core values.

Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the dedication, resilience, and integrity that fueled the family business. Here are some fundamental principles that have been passed down through generations, shaping not only Bel's journey but also my approach as an Operating Partner in the private equity space:

- Respecting the Team: Bel has always believed in treating employees like family. This deep respect for the team has fostered a culture of loyalty, collaboration, and mutual growth. It's a principle I hold dear, knowing that a company's true strength lies in its people. 

- Running the Business the Right Way: Integrity has always been at the heart of Bel Fuse. My grandfather's mantra of doing business the right wayfairly, ethically, and transparentlyhas been a cornerstone of success. This ethos guides my interactions and decisions as I work with founders to build sustainable and ethical businesses.

- Balancing Conservatism with Aggression: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the art of balancing conservative strategies with calculated risks. My father has and continues to excel at identifying moments to be bold while maintaining a prudent approach. This balance is crucial in driving growth without compromising stability.

- Consistent Leadership and Values: The importance of consistent leadership and adherence to core values cannot be overstated. At Bel Fuse, leadership is not just about steering the company but embodying the values that have been their foundation. I strive to bring this consistency to portcos I partner with, ensuring that the companies I support stay true to their roots while evolving for future success.

As I reflect on these invaluable lessons, I am filled with pride and gratitude. They have not only shaped Bel Fuse's legacy but also equipped me to support other founders on their journeys. In my current role, I leverage these insights to help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and build businesses that stand the test of time.

Here's to 75 years of Bel Fuseand to many more years of leadership, integrity, and success!

"Poor planning on your part, does not constitute an emergency on mine

Those words made me flash back immediately to internal medicine residency, when that was one of my attendings favourite catchphrase. As a senior resident, it taught me accountability and responsibility, and the importance of thinking two steps ahead. In the hospital, it is easier for the team to rally around right thing to do - which is to get the patient feeling better and discharged.

In the informatics world (and upper levels of administration in general), we sometimes lose sight of the patient as the point of singular focus. Its the budget, or team resources, or personal reputation, or political capital, or many other competing priorities.

When introducing DiMe to new people, I often say, ""we're not tech determinists; we're tech enthusiasts. We're not here to shoe-horn technology into every nook and cranny of healthcare and call it success. Rather, we're here to make sure these new tools in the toolbox are deployed to solve the most pressing and persistent challenges in our field.""As our team grows and our remit expands, I'm conscious that this singular focus on harnessing the promise of digital technology to improve lives becomes more challenging. And this is why we must have a patient role on staff. Not a series of patient focus groups paid in stale bagels and indifference, but a paid position that combines a voice in strategic decision-making with tactical input to our programming and influence over our messaging and storytelling. It is hard showing up at work every day and holding yourself and each other to a standard of promoting innovation to improve lives. This team does it brilliantly, even on the hard days, and this Patient-in-Residence role will help us stay focused and help us deliver. Grace will make us better.

My heartfelt gratitude  for the immense efforts  put together by world-renowned MIT faculty, experienced, knowledgeable and passionate mentors  (Vinay Kumar Pallerla, Ishwor Bhusal, Amir Tavasoli, Anuj Saboo, Fred Premji), dedicated and empowering program managers (Jasper Gill, Shweta A.) and program team . I will miss this challenging and fulfilling learning journey where I connected, collaborated and competed with the brightest minds . I highly recommend this program to all Data Science, AI/ML enthusiasts who are looking to dive deeper. Best wishes to all!

Developing a portfolio  (https://lnkd.in/eN_vtVFE) of industry-relevant hands-on Data Science and Machine Learning projects using python and participating in Hackathon , applying all the learning  to increase the accuracy of the model, has been a great motivator and confidence booster . I am really excited to put these skills to innovative work  in real world applications and dive deeper .

None of this would be possible without the unwavering support  of my husband (Ritesh Shrivastava), kids , extended family and friends! Celebrating my graduation from this program along with my daughter's (Prisha Shrivastava) graduation   from high school is an adorable memory to cherish forever :)

"Meet Yulia Miller, St. Jude's pioneering lead Cultural Navigator in the Department of Social Work. This role was created as part of the SAFER Ukraine initiative in 2022 to bridge the gap in providing needed cultural support and care outside the hospital walls. As a native of Ukraine and a former interpreter for St. Jude, Miller was in a unique position to guide patient families through American customs and provide vital support during their time in Memphis. This included helping caregivers get a driver's license or going with family members to a doctor's appointment. On this International Women's Day, we celebrate Yulia Miller and her dedication in guiding international patient families at St. Jude. The work of the Social Work team not only fosters cultural understanding by leading with empathy but highlights the contributions of women's roles in healthcare. To alleviate some of the stresses of navigating a new city, Miller welcomes families upon their arrival, helps familiarize them with housing, and offers resources to ease in their transition. No matter how long she is with them she emphasizes that she is always available to help. In her role, Miller empowers families to participate in their child's care by fostering open communication and trust with providers as part of the St. Jude standard practice. In many international cultures, it is forbidden to question your doctor's opinion and ask questions. Here at St. Jude, we encourage families to interact in their child's care and feel empowered to ask questions. Although she does not always speak the language of every family, she provides empathy and respect in an impactful way, sharing that it is not always what you say but how you say it. hashtag#InternationalWomensDay hashtag#StJudeHeroes",Not AI or Machine Learning

"These 7 mistakes have cost me millions:I paid a hefty tuition at the School of Hard Knocks...Steal my notes and save yourself some time and heartache.(psst... share this if you found it helpful!)Don't mistake:"" Worrying for Planning"" Planning for Action"" Action for Progress"" Hearing for Listening"" Criticism for Feedback"" Net Worth for Self-WorthLet's break this down:1. Worry""Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.""Worry less about what might happen.Plan for what you will do.2. Planning""Plans are useless. Planning is essential.""The true value of a plan is not in its ability to accurately predict what will happen...Its value is in its ability to make you aware of potential OPTIONS so that when something invariably goes off the rails...You won't be taken by surprise.3. ActionThe universe responds to action.Not intentions.You are a catalyst for changing reality itself...But only if you actually DO something.As a general rule:Do More. Think Less.4. Progress""There is no greater waste than to do with excellence that which shouldn't be done at all.""Here's the problem:From where you're currently standing, you don't always know what the right things are you should do to get to your goals.This means you'll probably do a whole lot of wrong things.That's okay, so long as you pivot and adjust accordingly.The key is to avoid mindless action that confuses motion with progress.5. ListeningHearing is an involuntary process.You cannot turn off your ears.Listening, on the other hand, is a voluntary process that requires intention.It only occurs when you focus on a sound.Remember:Hearing is purely physical. Listening requires your mind.6. FeedbackCriticism only cares about the problem.Feedback only cares about the growth that's required to attain the solution.Focus on the one that will move you forward.7. Self-WorthNet Worth is the culmination of your financial endeavors.Self-Worth is the culmination of the opinion you have of yourself.They have nothing to do with one another.But because one is easier to measure, and therefore manage, it's the one we tend to focus on.This is a mistake, because the most important things in life cannot be measured on a spreadsheet.""

"Just yesterday, I attended an inspiring Fireside Chat at Atlas School, hosted by Aaron Smith, M.Ed. The event featured insightful discussions with industry leaders from BOK Financial, including Garrett Guthrie, CDR, Amy Brown, Brent Lewis, and Sean Medlin. It was a fantastic opportunity to network and gain insights into the future of technology and banking.

BOK Financial is a prime example of community-driven banking, with a strong focus on local initiatives in Tulsa. The speakers discussed various innovative projects, emphasizing their commitment to consumer and mobile web development. They highlighted their efforts to introduce features that distinguish them from their competitors and shared their vision for staying modern and effective over the next 15 years. Their focus on modernizing payment processes and API integration strategies, along with their proactive approach to addressing technical debt within the software engineering team, was impressive as well. I value how they highlighted the significance of both soft and technical skills, emphasizing that it goes beyond memorization.

I'm thankful for the chance to attend a school that helps forge connections with top companies like BOK Financial in the Tulsa tech scene. Their groundbreaking work in banking technology truly inspires me, and I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about their company.

"Some people are focused on daily tasks while others are focused on their goals and how to achieve them. I've found these differences to be quite similar to the differences between people who are intuitive vs. sensing. Those who tend to focus on goals and ""visualize"" best can see the big pictures over time and are also more likely to make meaningful changes and anticipate future events. These goal-oriented people can step back from the day-to-day and reflect on what and how they're doing. They are the most suitable for creating new things (organizations, projects, etc.) and managing organizations that have lots of change. They typically make the most visionary leaders because of their ability to take a broad view and see the whole picture.In contrast, those who tend to focus on daily tasks are better at managing things that don't change much or that require processes to be completed reliably. Task-oriented people tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists. They are slower to depart from the status quo and more likely to be blindsided by sudden events. On the other hand, they're typically more reliable. Although it may seem that their focus is narrower than higher-level thinkers, the roles they play are no less critical.

"TIS THE SEASON...In the fall of 1989, I was given an other fun assignment from my client at WB.Cut the trailer for another National Lampoon's Vacation movie.I had cut the previous one, so i was really looking forward to it.Because there were only four or five trailer companies at the time ( imagine that !), the editors had to cut everything. No one really had one specialty, we had to know how to cut every genre and I actually really enjoyed cutting comedy trailers quite a lot, because it was so different.There was also no double vending,( imagine that!), so the client worked with you until they got what they wanted and that made the collaboration special.We were in the trenches together.This was my 8th collaboration with John Hughes, who actually wrote all the National Lampoon Vacation movies.Even though John was just the writer on the movie, he was the producer and everything went thru him.For some reason, I couldn't use the famous Lindsey Buckingham song i had used in the previous trailer I had cut ( European Vacation ), so I had a composer give me something that sounded similar.The movie was as funny and outrageous as the other ones, so I had a blast cutting the trailer.We had the brilliant Percy Rodriguez read the copy for us and it took a few takes to finally get it without laughing.The film performed well at the box office, grossing $73.3 million against a $25 million budget  and it is now regarded as a Christmas classic.Merry Christmas everyone!!",Not AI or Machine Learning

When someone believes in your potential, you begin to believe it too""it permits people to dream big. As a young girl in Morocco, I was privileged to have opportunities that were unheard of for girls at the time. My parents made a bet on education and a bet on me. They instilled in me a belief that everything is possible and the importance of helping others who come after me.When you lift others, you create ripples. The person you uplift may, in turn, help someone else. It's a chain reaction""a legacy of empowerment.I am privileged to have many who have and continue to uplift me which led me to a career that provides such a platform. Few years ago, I joined a small group of peers to embark on a mission of elevating women in technology.

It is with a heart full of gratitude that I announce my departure from Haleon. Looking back, I am filled with pride at what we have accomplished together.  From our earliest days within the GSK family to the bold strides we took to establish Haleon as a standalone entity, each milestone has been a testament to our collective dedication. Standing at the forefront of Haleon's evolution has been one of my life's greatest honors.  Witnessing our transition from a function within GSK to an independent powerhouse has not just been a corporate success story but a personal saga of growth and learning.

"In 2023, Louis Vuitton MoAt Hennessy became the first company in Europe to cross $500 billion in market capitalization Y 3 Here's a look at their impressive business empire & how LVMH became the world's largest luxury group YY14French multinational conglomerate LVMH has mastered the art of acquiring and cultivating iconic luxury brands while allowing each to retain its unique identity. The group's origins trace back to 1987 when Louis Vuitton merged with MoAt Hennessy.But everything started to really take off with Bernard Arnault.Under the leadership of the world's richest man, LVMH then expanded rapidly by acquiring heritage brands and positioning itself at the forefront of innovation.Today, LVMH comprises over 70 prestigious names including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Sephora.It operates in six segments:- Fashion and leather goods- Wines and spirits- Perfumes and cosmetics- Watches and jewelry- Retail, and hospitality.On top of that, it also has a PE firm that has invested in FinTechs like Freetrade, tech startups like Peloton, etc.How did they manage to achieve it all? YLVMH's success stems from its decentralized structure where each brand functions autonomously with its own creative director. This therefore allows the brands to make decisions quickly while benefiting from LVMH's scale.This is perfectly illustrated by record sales of $85.9 billion in 2022, showing that LVMH is a leader in the space and continues to identify growth opportunities. More importantly, the active involvement of Bernard Arnault's family also indicates the group's focus on long-term vision.LVMH's strategic brand acquisitions coupled with operational expertise make it a company like no other.Impressionnante.P.S. check out Ylinas.substack.comY, it's the only newsletter you need for all things when Finance meets Technology.

Age matters (in the bean world) fresher roasted beans really do create a better cup, and when my beans start to get a bit old I do find the pressure on my extracts dramatically decreases.2.)

If you've ever had worked with Carla Hackett, you've definitely heard her say those words.  This is her attitude...day in and day out...no matter the adversity that comes her way.

Carla is one of the best humans I have had the privilege to know.  She is smart and compassionate.  She cares so much for others and it shines through.  And, because those around her know how much she cares, they will go the extra mile to help her be successful.

Since Carla's LinkedIn doesn't tell her full story (Carla, you need to update your LinkedIn), let me tell you a little about her success as part of the Walmart Health team.  Carla and her team are responsible for leading on site implementation.  Her team takes an empty health center and brings it to life with equipment, supplies, technology, etc.  Over the past few years, Carla has taken this program from ""barely getting by"" to ""best in class"".  This year alone, I witnessed her team take a building from bare to fully functional IN 3 DAYS.  This didn't happen by accident.  Carla and her team have worked tirelessly on sequencing and checklists.  She has built strong relationships with vendors who bend over backwards to support her.  She gets it done.

In addition to all this, Carla has extensive experience in construction management.  She has an eye for detail and won't accept shoddy work.

Lastly, and most importantly, Carla is one of my dearest friends.  She is my ""sister from another mother"".  If you don't take the opportunity to hire Carla Hackett, you are missing the chance to hire one of the most talented people I know.",Not AI or Machine Learning

"Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I would like to share with you that on May 20, 2024, our beloved dad, Shan K. Thever, passed away.

Our dad was a vibrant personality, energetic professional and dedicated husband, father and grandfather. He was an inspiration in so many ways and to so many people. 

He came to this country with only a few hundred dollars in his pocket. Through his determination, hard work and tenacity, he successfully completed his undergraduate education at UCLA and received his JD from UCLA School of Law. 

Our dad went on to establish and lead a successful law practice for decades. He was a trailblazer and a pioneer both in and out of the courtroom. He was courageous, took risks and overcame numerous obstacles, and was a preeminent attorney, successfully arguing cases in front of the California Supreme Court. He served as the Director of the Small Law Firm Center at the New York City Bar Association and for the past five years he served as the Deputy County Council for Los Angeles County as a member of the Ethics, Transparency and Legislative Affairs team.

Our dad was a colleague, friend and confidant of Governors, County Supervisors, Council Members and so many others. In addition to numerous awards and appointments, he received the inaugural Trailblazer Award from the South Asian Bar Association and was recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives, receiving a U.S. Congressional Commendation for being an inspiring leader in the South Asian community and a true advocate for political change among the Asian population.

He was an inspiration not only for the professional success he achieved, but also for the way he lived his life. He believed in living a productive and meaningful life, in helping others, in lifting his community and in creating greater opportunity for his children than he had himself. He instilled in us a deep responsibility to, in turn, create greater opportunity for our children and generations to come. He also instilled in us the importance of public service and of being contributing members of society and having a meaningful impact on the world.

In his personal time he loved to be with his family celebrating holidays, cooking together, and discussing politics and current events over a bottle of Cabernet. 

He loved his grandchildren more than anything and was so very proud to see the young people they are and the success they continue to achieve. He was happy to see the wealth of opportunity in front of them. 

While he may not be here in physical form, our dad is always with us. He lived a successful, productive and impactful life, and this world is a better place because of him.

We ask that if you have any special anecdotes, stories or memories about our dad to please share with us via private message.",Not AI or Machine Learning

These testimonies delved deep into the challenges of military service, highlighting the systemic barriers that persist, including sexual harassment, assault, sexual discrimination, and gender bias. These are stark realities that too many of our sisters in arms endure, often in silence. I realized how much I've taken this bond for granted. The shared experiences,  understanding, and unwavering support that come with this sisterhood are invaluable. It's an anchor, a source of strength, and a reminder of the resilience and solidarity that define us.As a proud U.S. Army veteran now with SCE, I am more motivated than ever to advocate for and empower my fellow female veterans.

It's a transition that's both bittersweet and deeply nostalgic, stirring a sea of emotions as I look back on the journey that shaped not just a company, but me.It seems like only yesterday, that I embarked on an entrepreneurial quest. A quest fueled by a dream. That dream took shape in the form of a startup, DocASAP, nurtured from concept to creation with passion, sweat, and perhaps a few too many sleepless nights. Then came the pivotal moment, a leap of faith, as we joined forces with Optum. It was more than a business decision; it was an aspiration to touch lives on a grander scale.Reflecting on the past 10+ years fills my heart with gratitude and nostalgia. Together, we didn't just build a company; we scaled dreams, hopes, and the very essence of possibility. The journey transformed me, pushing the boundaries of what I thought feasible, turning ambitious goals into tangible realities and through the process building a circle of lifelong friends and relationships.Now, as I stand on the precipice of a new chapter, my heart races with the same exhilaration that kept me up at night all those years ago.

"It was fantastic to visit Octopus Energy this week to see some of the exciting work they're doing to roll out low carbon technologies to customers and enable net zero. Domestic engagement is going to be key to meeting net zero targets and heat and transport are the two big-win areas. On our own National Grid Electricity Distribution network, we've seen the number of EVs increase eightfold in the last five years, and heat pumps are following a similar trajectory. Making sure customers can connect these net zero technologies is a priority for both companies and so we've entered into a new partnership to speed up the installation of heat pumps and other technologies. This new way of working allows Octopus engineers to upgrade supply fuses on the incoming network when they are carrying out an installation, reducing the connections process by up to ten weeks for customers. This is a great example of our ongoing collaboration with Octopus and I can't wait to see what comes next. Thank you to Rachel Fletcher, Thomas Root and the Octopus team for such an engaging visit and my team, Ben Godfrey, Oliver Spink, Susan Robson, Josh Cocker ACMA, CGMA !",Not AI or Machine Learning

"On nearly every Mothers or Fathers Day, my girls inevitably ask, When is Kids Day? To which my husband and I predictably respond, Every day is Kids Day. But the truth is, I feel like every day is Mothers Day.

I kept my difficulties with fertility out of work conversations for over a decade.

It was such an important reminder of how powerful our relationships at the office can be, both professionally and personally.

How does it hurt organizations?Using Soroco's Scout work graph, we have quantified, across multiple industries and functions, how un-integrated systems hurt business outcomes. And what can business leaders do about to fix this? As far as I can tell, nobody has been able to quantify, across the board, the impact of these situations on businesses. The work graph can reveal so much more. This is just yet another example.I had the most incredible time brainstorming and writing this with Sandeep Dadlani (of UnitedHealth Group), who immediately saw why this is a problem for every organization on the planet. And also why this is an opportunity for all business leaders to make a difference. And this sort of work takes long periods of incredible R&D, understanding data, and excavating the work graph.

"As a working Mom, I appreciate the flowers, brunch and ""me"" time that comes every year with Mother's Day. But let's be honest. It's quickly back to reality on Monday morning, and we're already juggling the week's agenda....dinner menus, sports schedules, band concerts and squeezing in your kiddo's long overdue dentist appointment.
 
Moms are amazing, but they are also exhausted. We need to take all of the Mother's Day gratitude and appreciation and channel it into reimagining the way we support moms at work.
 
We're doing it at Brillect by leading with our value of taking care of people. And that starts with connecting people with careers that fit their lives. For one of our consultants that means taking the summers off. For another, it's taking a short break from consulting to focus on a home renovation project. To others, it's having Fridays off or a workday that ends at 3.
 
But it also means giving people the space to do what they need to do. Not eyeing the clock when someone leaves early or raising an eyebrow when someone arrives 10 minutes late to your morning meeting. It's about trusting people to do their work. And leaders, it also means walking the talk to show our employees we practice what we preach when it comes to flexibility and putting people first. 
 
We're all in the thick of this dance called life, and it's not easy to juggle it all. But when we give each other grace, flexibility and the freedom of having a career that meets you where you're at...I think we start to reclaim that joy we have on Mother's Day all year round.

"In 2010, I launched Heller Search Associates with two assets: a considerable network of CIOs and a wonderful colleague, Carol Lynn Thistle. Carol Lynn and I were hustling for business for our new executive search firm when I received a call from a procurement leader at Toyota North America. Barbara Cooper, Toyota North America's then-CIO, had nominated Heller Search to be certified by the WBENC as a women-owned business. The certification sounds simple: just be a woman and own a business. But in fact, this was an expensive, protracted process (for what was then a fledgling two-person firm), which Barbara not only funded; she made sure her expert team guided us through. Today, as a much larger firm "" but still woman owned "" we continue to renew our certification and display it proudly in our marketing, and I will always be thankful to Barbara for helping Heller Search so early in our existence. Barbara used her resources and influence to put a woman's network into action, as so many of us women in technology are doing today. This week, in celebration of International Women's Day, I would like to honor this tradition of women helping women by quoting some of the most meaningful pieces of advice from women CIOs, whom I have had the honor to publish in my column and in The Heller Report over the years.First up in our series on inspirational advice from female executives is Penelope Prett, who was CIO of Accenture when I interviewed her back in 2020. Penelope currently leads Accenture's Workday business group. ""We live in a world of publicity and social media, where people are always watching what you are doing. When you live in this world, and represent your company, you need an identifiable personal brand. I'm not talking about writing a lot of white papers.

"Wednesday marked a monumental splash as we installed the first of 176 monopile foundations as part of our Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. These steel, vertical cylinders measure over 272 feet long and tip the scales at nearly 1,500 tons each! 

Anchored into the sea floor 29 miles off the Virginia Beach coast, this foundation is set to support a tower and turbine nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty and Washington Monument combined. 

Now thats a strong foundation for a cleaner energy future!

"Amongst my personal values, fairness is probably the one I feel most strongly about. But is the game really fair? Not yet. But when we all do our part, I personally believe it can and will be. And there are inspiring examples. One comes from the company I joined two years ago: During my interview process, my son fell sick at home and had a crisis right in the middle of my third Zoom interview. I remember feeling like I had blown my chance at the job. However, my interview partner surprised me by showing understanding. She explained that one of the company's core values is being open and true to ourselves, acknowledging that being a parent doesn't stop when work begins. She kindly offered to reschedule, but I requested a couple of minutes to calm my son (and myself) before continuing the interview. That moment of support stuck with me throughout the process, and when I was offered the job, it was one of the reasons I said yes. The company I'm proud to be a part of is Logitech.Thinking about this experience recently, it reminded me about the pivotal role culture plays in creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed, included, and valued  where all people get a fair chance to truly flourish. I feel this way about Logitech's culture. At the heart of it - like for any culture -are its people. It's up to all of us to inspire inclusion and ensure that no one feels left out. Individually and collectively as teams, allies, ERGs etc. If you want to drive change, you need to take action. Every small step counts. As the saying goes, ""If you are not actively including, you might be accidentally excluding."" Let's support, uplift, and empower one another, not just today, but every day.

"In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, the role of a leader has become more crucial than ever before. Many people believe that a leader should have an all-encompassing set of skills, characteristics, and abilities to handle any obstacle, challenge, or opportunity that comes their way. However, the reality is quite different. The most successful and effective leaders don't try to outshine everyone else by being know-it-alls. Instead, they rely on their team's collective knowledge, expertise, and experience to make informed decisions and drive their organization toward success. These leaders understand that they don't have to be the smartest person in the room to lead effectively. They recognize their strengths and weaknesses and work with their team to fill the gaps in their knowledge and skill set. By doing so, they create a culture of collaboration, openness, and mutual respect, which not only boosts morale but also fosters a sense of belonging and ownership among their team.
