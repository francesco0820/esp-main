"What an amazing week last week at Edison Electric Institute's 2024 conference.  It was the first time I attended this conference and will definitely be back!  Special thanks to Pedro Pizarro, Maria Pope, Calvin Butler, Dan R. Brouillette and the rest of the EEI Board for hosting Jensen Huang and me for a very thought-provoking lunch, followed by a great fireside chat between Pedro and Jensen discussing the future of Energy and the role #AI will play. 

So many great discussions with utility leaders and especially enjoyed my panel discussion with Hema Sundaram, Neva Espinoza, Maria Robinson hosted by Mary Sprayregen on AI: The Next Big Opportunity for Collaboration.  It was clear that utilities will benefit from open industry specific generative AI models that can be leveraged to help the entire industry move faster towards meeting our clean energy goals. 

AI is poised to revolutionize the utilities sector in numerous ways. By harnessing the power of AI, utilities can optimize grid management, enhance predictive maintenance, and improve demand forecasting. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, allowing for quicker decision-making and more efficient resource allocation. This leads to increased operational efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced reliability of energy supply. Additionally, AI can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources by predicting their availability and managing their intermittency, thus supporting the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

Generative AI will play a crucial role in this transformation. Gen AI can create advanced predictive models and simulations, enabling utilities to better anticipate and prepare for various scenarios. It can also automate complex processes, reducing human error and freeing up resources for more strategic tasks. Furthermore, Gen AI can enhance customer engagement by providing personalized recommendations and solutions, thus improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. The potential of Gen AI in driving innovation and efficiency in the utilities sector is immense and will be a key factor in achieving our clean energy goals.

Was also excited to see the team from Deloitte and Utilidata announce a partnership to scale the Karmen distributed AI platform.   A software defined grid is a sustainable grid.  An open platform like Karmen allows for third party players to join in helping provide innovative applications that will reduce costs to rate payers while providing more resilient, reliable, secure and sustainable operations.

"A few years ago I worked with an airline to improve the utilization of the commercial cargo with very nifty AI-based Revenue Management solutions. The technology could get the airline 10ppt extra utilization across its entire network (worth over $100M per year in bottom line) but they could not get to that value until they got airport palletizing procedures to be optimized and cargo sales reps to use the technology in their day to day workflow. Both critical non-tech changes.For real value, it's #NeverJustTech - There is so much more to consider in order to maximize the performance of digital and AI solutions. Every time a new solutions gets introduced to optimize a process or a customer experience, there will likely be changes required upstream and downstream of that process as per my airline example. That's why business leaders must own the reimagination of that business process with technology AND also own the change management. It's also why such efforts are so often failing if they are tucked too low in the organization with managers who don't own the end-to-end process or if they are being pushed by IT. #McKinseyDigital #RewiredBook",AI or Machine Learning

"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

"Is your company well-positioned to take advantage of the coming AI wave?

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

AI-Enabled Company 

	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

AI-Centered Company 

	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

	Has multiple core business processes AI-enabled, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

	Has a change management program and employee re-education program to help up-level their knowledge to incorporate AI. 

AI is fast becoming a core driver of innovation, growth and competitive advantage.

"We started Hippocratic AI with a clear mission: to fundamentally transform healthcare by safely harnessing the power of generative AI to improve access, equity, and outcomes. Today, I'm proud to announce that we've closed a $53M Series A funding round at a $500M valuation.Since our founding last year, we have proven our ability to build an LLM for healthcare that is safer and more effective than general-purpose generative AI models. Today, the company also released its first product for phase three safety testing: a staffing marketplace for healthcare where health systems, payors, and others can hire generative AI agents that complete low-risk, non-diagnostic, patient-facing healthcare tasks to help solve the massive shortage of healthcare nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and other healthcare professionals. These new funds will be used to accelerate further product development and conduct phase three safety testing for its LLM and the world's first generative AI-powered healthcare agents that can unlock  Super-Staffing' for healthcare and improve outcomes for patients and providers alike. Importantly, though, generative AI must be developed and deployed safely and responsibly to make a real positive impact. I can confidently say that our investors  Premji Invest - US, General Catalyst, SV Angel and Memorial Hermann Health System, as well as existing investors a16z Bio + Health, share our deep commitment to  do no harm' and focus on responsible innovation.

"This chart about the costs of training AI large language models (LLMs) caught my attention. Economic theoryparticularly in the technology industryhas long suggested that supply-side innovation can cause prices to fall rapidly for critical infrastructure, even with increasing demand. Think of computer hardware and semiconductor chips as prime examples. 

Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, saw that theory in action. Moore observed that as the number of transistors on a computer chip doubled over a period of about 18 months, the price of the chip over the same period fell by about half. That was way back in 1965and the so-called Moores law for chip progress and pricing has continued to hold roughly true for the nearly six decades since (a veritable eon in the tech world). But fast forward to 2024, and generative AI seems to be turning Moores law on its head: costs of training the next generation of LLMs arent halving; instead, prices have roughly doubled every nine months. 

So what explains this reversal? Its all about how LLMs scale.

To date, many of the AI races main drivers have seemed to be hyper-fixated on scaling up the existing architecture. Many LLM champions believe that to get to where AI wants to go, scale is all you need. Just make the transformer models bigger and more powerful, their thinking goes, and LLMs will revolutionize the economy andfor somelead to artificial generalized intelligence. That view is why frontier model company CEOs talk about numbers like $10-billion training costs for a model and a $100-billion supercomputer.
 
But today, Im hearing more and more about scaling down. In stark contrast to LLMs, the small language model (SLM) theory is that smaller models, more tightly engineered for narrower applications and domains, will increasingly supplant LLMs. The same way that fine-tuned four-cylinder engines in a modern BMW 4 series outperform (more horsepower with better gas efficiency) the V8 450-cubic-inch engines that used to power Corvettes. SLMs are also typically trained on finely curated high-quality data setsanalogous to the high-octane gas that the four-cylinder engine needs to use. As such, the costs of SLMs may map more closely to Moores law than their large-language counterparts. 

For the moment, developers and investors are essentially betting on both of these theoriesLLMs and SLMssimultaneously. However, that probably wont continue forever in the same fashion. 

Scale-is-all-you-need LLMs will have to demonstrate extraordinary ROI to justify their $100-billion price tags, while SLMs will have to prove that they are flexible enough to fit multiple use cases and continue to improve their efficiency at domain-specific tasks. Companies adopting AI will also need to decide when they need a fine-tuned BMW and when they need a powerhouse Corvette. 

I believe this is one of the most fascinating and consequential races in the AI world right now...and one to watch closely.",AI or Machine Learning

"Last Friday, I had the immense honor of delivering the keynote speech at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Expo, held at the Challenger Learning Center in the vibrant heart of downtown Tallahassee. My talk, titled ""Harnessing AI to Complete the Bench to Bedside Loop in Healthcare,"" aimed to illuminate the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing healthcare, drawing parallels with the iterative nature of space exploration.In the realm of healthcare, the journey from molecular hypothesis (the bench) to the development of a drug and its validation in the real world (the bedside) is intricate and complex. Yet, this is where the magic happens, and AI steps in to bridge the gap. Through my keynote, I explored how AI not only accelerates this process but also enhances our ability to iterate and optimize continuously, ensuring that real-world evidence feeds back into our molecular hypotheses, thereby refining and advancing our understanding.The bench to bedside loop represents a cornerstone of medical research and development, embodying the essence of iterative optimization. With AI, we stand on the brink of being able to automate, scale, and accelerate these iterations like never before, opening up unprecedented possibilities for healthcare advancements.As we say, ""Per aspera ad astra"" - through hardships to the stars. The path to harnessing AI in healthcare is fraught with challenges, but it is also filled with immense potential and hope. I am thrilled to be a part of this journey, contributing to the efforts that aim to revolutionize healthcare for the betterment of humanity.Thank you Florida State University for the invitation!

"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work. To Raghuveer ., Atmaja Apsangi, Sumit Agrawal, Sombir Kadian, I extend my gratitude for fostering the Shark Idea Tank platform, a catalyst that expedited my innovation journey and exposed me to a realm of other ground-breaking ideas.

"Lots of great stuff in here..In my initial read this final rule seems to lay frameworks for requiring mechanistic interpretability of AI/decision support models embedded withih health IT going forward. I expect in practice we will find that most models will consider all of these source attributes to some extent and the binary disclosure of their use will lack meaning. 

Will this governance framework accelerate or impair the development and adoption of clinical decision support tools native to health IT? 

While the policy is well-intentioned, this may turn health IT vendors into marketplaces for decision support models rather than developers of them...

"Is your company well-positioned to take advantage of the coming AI wave?

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

AI-Enabled Company 

	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

AI-Centered Company 

	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

	Has multiple core business processes AI-enabled, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

	Has a change management program and employee re-education program to help up-level their knowledge to incorporate AI. 

AI is fast becoming a core driver of innovation, growth and competitive advantage.

"Every year at The AES Corporation, we celebrate Safety Day. Safety is our first value and top priority, and this week, our AES Utilities in Indiana and Ohio paused and reflected on our Safety legacy to inform how we can execute our work for the future. The AES Utilities use technology and innovation to improve safety practices, which enables us to reliably serve our customers and communities.

At AES Indiana, we recognized the AES Indiana team at Eagle Valley Generating Station on their significant efforts to improve their safety performance through implementing emergency management, designing an outstanding training program, and performing effective audits. In Ohio, we recognized the tireless efforts of AES Ohio crews and contractors for their restoration efforts earlier this spring when storms impacted more than 36,000 customers across the 24-county service territory. In moments like this, we know our customers look to us to get power restored as quickly as possible, and its our responsibility to do this as safely as possible. At AES El Salvador, the immense potential of technology allows us to streamline and make our processes safer, such as using drones for inspecting our distribution grids and applying AI and machine learning to predict and detect unauthorized residential electrical connections.

This week reaffirmed our commitment to employee, contractor and public safety and the commitment we have to each other to ensure each one of us returns home safely at the end of every day, and that is made possible by the hard work and agility of every person who is part of our AES Utilities Team.

"Can generative image models be good world models?
This work from @Meta FAIR shows that there is a tradeoff between realism and diversity.
The more realistic a generative model becomes, the less diverse it becomes.
Realism comes at the cost of coverage.
In other words, the most realistic systems are mode-collapsed.

My hunch, supported by a growing amount of empirical evidence, is that world models should *not* be generative.
They should make predictions in representation space.
In representation space, unpredictable or otherwise irrelevant information is absent.
This is the main argument in favor of JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures).

It uses a factorized approach that not only allows us to train video generation models more efficiently but also produces higher quality video generations.The outputs of this model were preferred by 96% of respondents over our previous model based on output quality in human evaluations.2i a Emu EditThis new model is capable of free-form editing through text instructions. Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs "" the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"As a working Mom, I appreciate the flowers, brunch and ""me"" time that comes every year with Mother's Day. But let's be honest. It's quickly back to reality on Monday morning, and we're already juggling the week's agenda....dinner menus, sports schedules, band concerts and squeezing in your kiddo's long overdue dentist appointment.
 
Moms are amazing, but they are also exhausted. We need to take all of the Mother's Day gratitude and appreciation and channel it into reimagining the way we support moms at work.
 
We're doing it at Brillect by leading with our value of taking care of people. And that starts with connecting people with careers that fit their lives. For one of our consultants that means taking the summers off. For another, it's taking a short break from consulting to focus on a home renovation project. To others, it's having Fridays off or a workday that ends at 3.
 
But it also means giving people the space to do what they need to do. Not eyeing the clock when someone leaves early or raising an eyebrow when someone arrives 10 minutes late to your morning meeting. It's about trusting people to do their work. And leaders, it also means walking the talk to show our employees we practice what we preach when it comes to flexibility and putting people first. 
 
We're all in the thick of this dance called life, and it's not easy to juggle it all. But when we give each other grace, flexibility and the freedom of having a career that meets you where you're at...I think we start to reclaim that joy we have on Mother's Day all year round.

It's a transition that's both bittersweet and deeply nostalgic, stirring a sea of emotions as I look back on the journey that shaped not just a company, but me.It seems like only yesterday, that I embarked on an entrepreneurial quest. A quest fueled by a dream. That dream took shape in the form of a startup, DocASAP, nurtured from concept to creation with passion, sweat, and perhaps a few too many sleepless nights. Then came the pivotal moment, a leap of faith, as we joined forces with Optum. It was more than a business decision; it was an aspiration to touch lives on a grander scale.Reflecting on the past 10+ years fills my heart with gratitude and nostalgia. Together, we didn't just build a company; we scaled dreams, hopes, and the very essence of possibility. The journey transformed me, pushing the boundaries of what I thought feasible, turning ambitious goals into tangible realities and through the process building a circle of lifelong friends and relationships.Now, as I stand on the precipice of a new chapter, my heart races with the same exhilaration that kept me up at night all those years ago. Only this time, it's not just about what's next""it's about where I can make the most meaningful impact.Stepping into my new role at Optum, I am tasked with leading technology and AI innovation within Optum Insight.

Bruce Lee's famous quote on being ""like water"", showcases his philosophy on his martial art style, to be flexible and adapt. While I'm not saying architects go to combat (although sometimes it feels that way  ), flexibility and the adaptability is also one of the key skillsets to be an effective architect, and is a quality that is foundational to be a Full-stack architect. Architecture is a fluid space and the value we bring to the organization, while immense, hinges on our ability to adjust to change, as we work with a variety of stakeholders across the Enterprise.

"The AI revolution is in full swing, but where are the women? In some of the most recent AI panels, discussions and summits I have been at women are sorely underrepresented. It was so stark that some of the men at these events even made comments about it. Which I really appreciated because we absolutely need their support with remedying this issue. This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

As a data person, I needed some baseline data!! A survey by Junior Achievement (JA) conducted by the research group Engine shows that only 9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle nudging.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease. 

Interested in thoughts on how we can get ahead of this issue before its too late. This is a real problem..

"""We'll figure it out!""

If you've ever had worked with Carla Hackett, you've definitely heard her say those words.  This is her attitude...day in and day out...no matter the adversity that comes her way.

Carla is one of the best humans I have had the privilege to know.  She is smart and compassionate.  She cares so much for others and it shines through.  And, because those around her know how much she cares, they will go the extra mile to help her be successful.

Since Carla's LinkedIn doesn't tell her full story (Carla, you need to update your LinkedIn), let me tell you a little about her success as part of the Walmart Health team.  Carla and her team are responsible for leading on site implementation.  Her team takes an empty health center and brings it to life with equipment, supplies, technology, etc.  Over the past few years, Carla has taken this program from ""barely getting by"" to ""best in class"".  This year alone, I witnessed her team take a building from bare to fully functional IN 3 DAYS.  This didn't happen by accident.  Carla and her team have worked tirelessly on sequencing and checklists.  She has built strong relationships with vendors who bend over backwards to support her.  She gets it done.

In addition to all this, Carla has extensive experience in construction management.  She has an eye for detail and won't accept shoddy work.

Lastly, and most importantly, Carla is one of my dearest friends.  She is my ""sister from another mother"".  If you don't take the opportunity to hire Carla Hackett, you are missing the chance to hire one of the most talented people I know.",Not AI or Machine Learning

"It's a big week for Rad AI with the announcement of our $50M Series B Funding round led by Khosla Ventures. 

As we celebrate this milestone and chart out course for the future, I can't help but reflect back to 2019 when Jeff Chang and Doktor Gurson were just getting started. Dr. Chang was a practicing radiologist at Greensboro Radiology and I was leading the sales team at Canopy Partners (a sister company). 

I remember joining Dr. Chang for one of his first sales meetings with our hometown health system Cone Health. We met with key execs, listened to their challenges, and asked probing questions about how #AI might be able to address some of these challenges. Dr. Chang took copious notes and, as we left the meeting, I asked him if he came away with any useful ideas for products. He did indeed and Cone Health ultimately became Rad AI's first health system client. 

I remember this like it was yesterday because I was so impressed with Dr. Chang's commitment to listening and developing innovative products designed to improve care delivery and solve customer challenges. That was 5 years ago and Rad AI has grown tremendously since then, but this customer-first approach is still in the DNA of our company today ... and I hope it always will be.

"What a great conference hosted by American Telemedicine Association this year in phoenix.  Delighted to be on an all-star physician panel moderated by Emma Beavins from Fierce Healthcare to break the hype about AI and its use for telemedicine and addressing healthcare workforce issues.

Top takeaways:
- We should keep healthy caution with bringing in #AI to clinicians and patients.  Focus on low risk, high frequency tasks (such as note documentation, scheduling and other clerical burden) as an entry point to build #trust in using AI
- All AI should be vetted to ensure we reduce workload for docs and friction for patients. Not all good ideas should be implemented when we don't have enough clinicians and they are at high risk of burning out.
- Most patients who experience AI now lean into it.  The tech has gotten so sophisticated that patients are enjoying the process when AI gathers info about what brings them into the office before the doc shows up on the telemedicine visit. [ Davis Liu, CMO of Curai Health]
- We must demand transparency for AI at the level of a busy physician.  Use of knowledge maps to link research citations to AI-powered clinical decision support can be done and is being done [Michal Tzuchman Katz, MD CEO of Kahun Medical]
- There is still a massive lack of understanding of what AI is, and why 2024 is different (punchline - the tech is so sophisticated that we can do complex work befitting clinician needs).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another. 

During our first 2024 Innovation Open House session last week, we hosted 20+ attendees from 7 healthcare organizations across the country. We would love to have you join us for future sessions.

"As the sun sets on my incredible journey with GSK/Haleon, a journey that has spanned nearly 22 years, I find myself reflecting on the moments that have shaped not just my career but my very character.  It is with a heart full of gratitude that I announce my departure from Haleon. Looking back, I am filled with pride at what we have accomplished together.  From our earliest days within the GSK family to the bold strides we took to establish Haleon as a standalone entity, each milestone has been a testament to our collective dedication. Standing at the forefront of Haleon's evolution has been one of my life's greatest honors.  Witnessing our transition from a function within GSK to an independent powerhouse has not just been a corporate success story but a personal saga of growth and learning.  Our triumphs have not only been in the balance sheets, but in the lives we've touched and the standards we've set in the consumer health industry. I am indebted to the multitude of mentors who have generously shared their wisdom with me over the years.  Your guidance has been the compass that navigated me through challenges and helped chart a course that we have all journeyed together.  I am humbly thankful for every lesson learned, every bit of encouragement received and your trust in me.

"One of the biggest problems with trying to use generative AI today is that AI is only capable of generating things that ""look like"" other things. 

This morning I was creating a framework in Miro and I just needed an arc line to draw something. They didn't have that shape, so I asked their AI to draw me one... and got a very unexpected result. Why would Miro think that I would want it to draw me a whole flow chart?

I think this is reflective of a larger issue with AI in the industry: tools trying to make things that ""look like"" deliverables rather than things that facilitate the design process. 

It is an important distinction. I have a friend who was subcontracting for another consultant working on a design project. This consultant, I think, really believed in the power of generative AI, but there were other flaws in his thinking. For example, he wanted my friend to draw a Theory of Change diagram, but she didn't have enough context for the client and capabilities. It eventually became very clear that this consultant didn't think about a Theory of Change diagram as a part of the design PROCESS, but actually thought of it as a ""deliverable."" What he really wanted was something that ""looked like"" a Theory of Change diagram.

We see the same thing when the hottest AI tool uses Figma to draw an interface. What we're seeing isn't an interface design, it is something that ""Looks like"" an interface design. The design PROCESS isn't about producing something that looks like an interface and throwing it over the wallwhen we draw things in Figma, we're creating centerpieces for conversations on a team. The team is full of brains that have context-specific knowledge, and the picture / diagram we're drawing is a way for us to synthesize that knowledge. 

I do draw a lot of flow charts, but Miro can't possible know what needs to be in my flow chart because usually I don't know. Flow charts are something that me and a team go back and forth on refining and refiningdiscovering questions and then tracking down answers, then updating the chart. When we get to the ""end,"" what we have is a composite of contextual knowledge that had probably never been synthesized before. 

It is just an odd thing. 

 
There might be a market for this. This consultant I mentioned might be happy with the outputs of AI generated thingsbut I think that this is something holey different from the design process.",AI or Machine Learning

"The AI revolution is in full swing, but where are the women? In some of the most recent AI panels, discussions and summits I have been at women are sorely underrepresented. It was so stark that some of the men at these events even made comments about it. Which I really appreciated because we absolutely need their support with remedying this issue. This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

As a data person, I needed some baseline data!! A survey by Junior Achievement (JA) conducted by the research group Engine shows that only 9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle nudging.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease. 

Interested in thoughts on how we can get ahead of this issue before its too late. This is a real problem..

Carol Lynn and I were hustling for business for our new executive search firm when I received a call from a procurement leader at Toyota North America. Barbara Cooper, Toyota North America's then-CIO, had nominated Heller Search to be certified by the WBENC as a women-owned business. The certification sounds simple: just be a woman and own a business. But in fact, this was an expensive, protracted process (for what was then a fledgling two-person firm), which Barbara not only funded; she made sure her expert team guided us through. Today, as a much larger firm "" but still woman owned "" we continue to renew our certification and display it proudly in our marketing, and I will always be thankful to Barbara for helping Heller Search so early in our existence. Barbara used her resources and influence to put a woman's network into action, as so many of us women in technology are doing today.

"Phew! A breathless day comes to an end in the world of AI. It seems there a two broad camps: one that thinks GPT4o is a big step towards AGI and the other which thinks the live demo was a dud. I subscribe to neither. I have talked about my opinions on the demo itself in a previous post. Let's now get to specifics of how I think this affects our work at samvid.ai

I spent the better part of the day using GPT4o on the kinds of documents we see in our work. As I have mentioned in many other posts, transformers are perception devices and GPT4o is exactly that, the best perception machine in the market. It can now retrieve basic information from unstructured documents with a high degree of accuracy. Old GPT4 was pretty bad at this (why was RAG even a thing given this performance level?) and it took very little to confuse the model. GPT4o is a remarkable improvement on that. However, GPT4o is also showing signs of overfitting. Suppose facts A and B exist in a document with no apparent connection between them. The old GPT4 would have given a McKinsey-like answer with deliberate vagueness about this connection. GPT4o, on the other hand, will go out on a limb and claim there is no relationship between A and B despite the lack of evidence, a fact that may be obviously wrong when evaluated by a domain expert. 

All this is great for samvid.ai . Two thoughts come to mind:
1. My team and I have no interest in spending additional time retrieving basic information from documents. It always seemed like a waste of resources. Would rather focus on higher order problems.
2. The goal of samvid.ai is to unlock the latent knowledge in documents using our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences and use this knowledge for enterprise decision making. Literally nothing about this mission has changed. If anything, our value proposition has gotten stronger. 

It has been a glorious day. Onward and upward.

Representing SCE at this event was more than just a professional opportunity; it was a profound journey back to the roots of a community I hold dear""the sisterhood of female veterans.The conference was filled with powerful conversations, but the stories shared in a breakout session exclusively for women veterans particularly resonated with me. These testimonies delved deep into the challenges of military service, highlighting the systemic barriers that persist, including sexual harassment, assault, sexual discrimination, and gender bias. These are stark realities that too many of our sisters in arms endure, often in silence. I realized how much I've taken this bond for granted. The shared experiences,  understanding, and unwavering support that come with this sisterhood are invaluable. It's an anchor, a source of strength, and a reminder of the resilience and solidarity that define us.As a proud U.S. Army veteran now with SCE, I am more motivated than ever to advocate for and empower my fellow female veterans.

"Modeling the world for action by generating pixel is as wasteful and doomed to failure as the largely-abandoned idea of ""analysis by synthesis"".Decades ago, there was a big debate in ML about the relative advantages of generative methods vs discriminative methods for classification.Learning theorists, such as Vapnik, argued against generative methods, pointing out that training a generative modeling was a way more difficult than classification (from the sample complexity standpoint).Regardless, a whole community in computer vision was arguing that recognition should work by generating pixels from explanatory latent variables. At inference time, one would infer the configuration of latent variables that generated the observed pixels.The inference method would use optimization: e.g. use a 3D model of an object and try to find the pose parameters that reproduce the image.This never quite worked, and it was very slow.Later, some people converted to the Bayesian religion and tried to use Bayesian inference for the latent (e.g. using variational approximations and/or sampling).At some point, when Non-Parametric Bayes and Latent Dirichlet Allocation became the rage in text modeling, some folks heroically attempted to apply that to object recognition from images.>>> THIS WAS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE <<<If your goal is to train a world model for recognition or planning, using pixel-level prediction is a terrible idea.Generation happens to work for text because text is discrete with a finite number of symbols. Dealing with uncertainty in the prediction is easy in such settings. Dealing with prediction uncertainty in high-dimension continuous sensory inputs is simply intractable.

Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by. I look forward to sharing more about this journey after I make my transition. For now, I'd like to say another big thank you to friends and colleagues at Accel-KKR and its many portfolio companies for an amazing couple of years. Thank you AKKR, it's been a joy!Team Basware....

"The growing acceptance of generative AI among U.S. doctors marks a significant shift, especially considering their traditional reluctance toward adopting new technologies. This shift underscores the potential benefits perceived by physicians, such as improved patient interactions and time savings. 

However, despite their openness, physicians remain cautious, emphasizing the importance of transparency regarding data sources and the need for professional oversight. The findings below also reveal a gap in organizational readiness, with many physicians indicating a lack of guidelines for using GenAI within their institutions. This highlights the need for healthcare organizations to develop clear protocols to ensure the responsible and effective implementation of AI tools in patient care.

Ever caught yourself nodding at abstracts and glossing over diagrams, all the while feeling that pang of missing out on the real essence of a research paper? You're not alone!I remember a time when ML research papers felt like deciphering a third language (and not in a fun way). Abstract? Easy. Intro and related works? Smooth sailing. But by the time I dove deep into the techniques and mathematical proofs, I felt more like an amateur detective looking for clues than a confident ML enthusiast.  But to truly wield the power of these papers and evolve as an exceptional ML engineer, you don't just need to READ, you need to IMPLEMENT. And that's where the magic happens.   On today's agenda: Transforming all that abstract understanding into tangible skills! I've decoded and broken down the process of implementing a model end-to-end, using the LLaMA paper as a reference. The cherry on top?

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"".

Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance."" Public perception goes through discontinuities when lots of people suddenly become aware of a technology -- maybe one that's been developing for a long time --  leading to a surprise.

"It's been 9 months since ChatGPT was released and 7 months since it became the fastest consumer application to reach 100 million monthly active users, ushering in a new era of generative AI. But other than ChatGPT, how are consumers interacting with generative AI products?To begin to answer this question, Olivia Moore and team looked at traffic data from internet-tracking analytics company SimilarWeb to rank the top 50 generative AI web products by monthly visits and analyzed how these products have grown over time, and where growth is coming from. While not an exhaustive ranking of all consumer AI platforms, this list serves as a tool to identify and understand category trends. Here are the top 6 takeaways:1. Most leading products are built from the ""ground up"" around generative AI2. ChatGPT has a massive lead, for now""3. LLM assistants (like ChatGPT) are dominant, but companionship and creative tools are on the rise4. Early ""winners"" have emerged, but most product categories are up for grabs5.

"Ys Achieved Amazon Ads Retail Certification! YsE-commerce and retail media, in particular, have grown incredibly over the past couple of years. At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible. I loved diving deep into the Amazon Ads Retail Certification course where I learned about retail readiness, Amazon's fulfillment solutions, the different aspects of selling on Amazon.com, how to launch a new product on Amazon.com, as well as, navigating Seller Central and Vendor Central.

"Let's recap what appears to be complete BS against Trump. The man wins an election against an unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton
. They pay for a fake dossier and claim it's not the American people who elected him but the Russians. A Special Counsel is appointed, millions of dollars are spent, and the conclusion is that there was never any collusion between Trump and the Russians. It was the American people who elected him. It was complete BS.

Once in the White House, a woman writes a memoir and claims Trump sexually assaulted her several decades ago. Trump says no, I never did what she is accusing me of. New York then changes the law so she could bring charges decades after. She's actually unable to provide any direct evidence because she waited decades to report the alleged assault. The case proceeds anyway; eventually, after back and forth, Trump has to pay her millions of dollars for defamation. In interviews, she says she can't wait to receive the money so that she can go shopping worldwide. She also says the sexual assault was never sexual; claims rape is sexy. The media ignores the inconsistencies because that's not what the so-called deep state wants.

A porn actress also comes out and says she had an affair with Trump decades ago, and Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. The government says, wow! That's such huge information, had the American people known that they would have elected Clinton. Several people say there's no case to be made there; eventually, the case goes to court with the government claiming that he did not specifically disclose that the legal fee was somehow a campaign contribution. Anyway, they convict Trump. Meanwhile, the porn industry exploits all these women and men, paying them only a small fee once to shoot their movies and using them for decades without ever paying them any other fee. One would think a government that cares about porn actresses would try to help them and stop the exploitation. No, they actually don't care.

I can go on and on. When junior journalists receive information from the government in the form of indictments, they often believe everything the government says, that they are just there trying to punish deadly criminals in society, that they are trying to stop a dangerous guy. Meanwhile, the so-called dangerous man has not done all the atrocities others have done in terms of laws that punish ordinary people, including some based on their race, and bombs all over the world that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Of course, Trump is not a perfect man. People attack him; he also attacks people, and so do you.

But the false claim that he's the worst American to have ever lived and that now he's akin to Adolf Hitler and if he's re-elected again, doom and gloom would envelop the United States are simply false. Now they are claiming that he's so crazy he might attack Biden on stage on June 27 when they debate in Atlanta next week. The hypocrisy is really disgusting. May God help us all.",Not AI or Machine Learning

Cultural growth and change emerge from the collective actions, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals across all levels of the organization.

of technology and innovation, coupled with a strong leadership presence that
inspires and guides your team towards success.

"The AI revolution is in full swing, but where are the women? In some of the most recent AI panels, discussions and summits I have been at women are sorely underrepresented. It was so stark that some of the men at these events even made comments about it. Which I really appreciated because we absolutely need their support with remedying this issue. This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

As a data person, I needed some baseline data!! A survey by Junior Achievement (JA) conducted by the research group Engine shows that only 9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle nudging.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease. 

Interested in thoughts on how we can get ahead of this issue before its too late. This is a real problem..

"What does Bruce Lee, the greatest martial artist of all time, have to do with Enterprise Architecture? Last week, I had the honor to be the keynote speaker at IQPC's Chief AI Officer Exchange in Fort Lauderdale, where I explored the evolution of Enterprise Architecture and the skillset required to be a ""Full-stack"" Architect. 
 
Bruce Lee's famous quote on being ""like water"", showcases his philosophy on his martial art style, to be flexible and adapt. While I'm not saying architects go to combat (although sometimes it feels that way  ), flexibility and the adaptability is also one of the key skillsets to be an effective architect, and is a quality that is foundational to be a Full-stack architect. Architecture is a fluid space and the value we bring to the organization, while immense, hinges on our ability to adjust to change, as we work with a variety of stakeholders across the Enterprise.

"I continue to hold two different views of AI - I see the benefits and potential but also the downside.  If you only see the benefits and get sucked into the hype, you can run into trouble.  If you only focus on the downside, you potentially miss out on the benefits.  I want to leverage the good while mitigating the downsides - which means understanding it and making sure your staff understand it and have formal responsible use guidelines and training.

That's why I read both critical and praising articles/reviews about AI, especially AI product releases. And, also put my hands on it myself to experience with benefits and drawbacks.

This a critical review of chatGPT4o and worth a read. The author points out the demo was a ""preview"" of advanced features being tested in controlled ways. The actual product release did not have all the features calling it a ""bait and switch.""  That's hype.  He compared it to product releases like mobile phones that show features in release demos that are actually in the product release.

""This tactic, in which A.I. companies promise wild new features and deliver a half-baked product, is becoming a trend that is bound to confuse and frustrate people . . . With artificial intelligence, companies are giving a preview of a potential future, demonstrating technologies that are being developed and working only in limited, controlled conditions. A mature, reliable product might arrive  or might not.""

He goes onto review the new features or ""improvements"" that were in the product release.He shares a couple of detailed examples of the common problem with LLMs, even this new improved version: hallucinations.  The models provide outright or subtle wrong answers or made up answers reinforcing the need to really check its work and not fall asleep at the wheel.

This article reminds us that when companies rush to release half-baked product, users are the product.  OpenAI said its iterative approach to updating ChatGPT allowed it to gather feedback to make improvements. We believe its important to preview our advanced models to give people a glimpse of their capabilities and to help us understand their real-world applications, the company said in a statement.

The bottom line from this review:

A major thing OpenAI got right with ChatGPT-4o is making the technology free for people to try. Free is the right price: Since we are helping to train these A.I. systems with our data to improve, we shouldnt be paying for them.
The best of A.I. has yet to come, and it might one day be a good math tutor that we want to talk to. But we should believe it when we see it  and hear it.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

 ""do we think there exists at least one design of an AI system that is simultaneously safe/controllable, and can fulfill objectives in more intelligent ways than humans ?""
If the answer is yes, we'll be fine.
If the answer is no, we won't build it.
Right now, we don't even have a hint of a design of a human-level intelligent system.

So it's too early to worry about it.
And it's way too early to regulate it to prevent ""existential risk.""",AI or Machine Learning

Despite his concerns about AI being one of the biggest threats to humanity, he believes in harnessing its power for good. Grok is a step in that direction, offering a playful and informative chatbot experience.Key highlights of Grok include:YY Playful Wit: Grok is designed to answer questions with a touch of humor and a rebellious streak, making interactions more engaging.YY Access to X Posts: Grok has access to user posts on the X platform, providing tailored and relevant responses to its users.YY Early Testing: While Grok is currently in early testing and not available to the general public, it will eventually be released to subscribers of X's top-tier subscription service, Premium+.To give you a taste of Grok's personality, Musk shared an example of a user query, where Grok humorously responded to a request for a ""step-by-step"" guide to making cocaine, ending with a responsible message against illegal activities.Grok's development is spearheaded by Musk's new AI company, xAI. It's powered by Grok-1, a large language model that surpasses GPT-3.5 in certain benchmarks. However, it's important to note that Grok-1 lags behind the most powerful hashtag#chatgpt model, hashtag#gpt4.According to the xAI team, Grok is currently available as a prototype for a limited number of users in the US, with plans for new capabilities and features in the pipeline.Grok embodies the idea of understanding thoroughly and intuitively, making it an exciting addition to the world of AI.

The group's origins trace back to 1987 when Louis Vuitton merged with MoAt Hennessy.But everything started to really take off with Bernard Arnault.Under the leadership of the world's richest man, LVMH then expanded rapidly by acquiring heritage brands and positioning itself at the forefront of innovation.Today, LVMH comprises over 70 prestigious names including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Sephora.It operates in six segments:- Fashion and leather goods- Wines and spirits- Perfumes and cosmetics- Watches and jewelry- Retail, and hospitality.On top of that, it also has a PE firm that has invested in FinTechs like Freetrade, tech startups like Peloton, etc.How did they manage to achieve it all? YLVMH's success stems from its decentralized structure where each brand functions autonomously with its own creative director. This therefore allows the brands to make decisions quickly while benefiting from LVMH's scale.This is perfectly illustrated by record sales of $85.9 billion in 2022, showing that LVMH is a leader in the space and continues to identify growth opportunities. More importantly, the active involvement of Bernard Arnault's family also indicates the group's focus on long-term vision.LVMH's strategic brand acquisitions coupled with operational expertise make it a company like no other.Impressionnante.P.S. check out Ylinas.substack.comY, it's the only newsletter you need for all things when Finance meets Technology.

This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum.

Worry""Don't worry about the future.

Planning""Plans are useless. Planning is essential.""The true value of a plan is not in its ability to accurately predict what will happen...Its value is in its ability to make you aware of potential OPTIONS so that when something invariably goes off the rails...You won't be taken by surprise.3. ActionThe universe responds to action.Not intentions.You are a catalyst for changing reality itself...But only if you actually DO something.As a general rule:Do More. Think Less.4. Progress""There is no greater waste than to do with excellence that which shouldn't be done at all.""Here's the problem:From where you're currently standing, you don't always know what the right things are you should do to get to your goals.This means you'll probably do a whole lot of wrong things.That's okay, so long as you pivot and adjust accordingly.The key is to avoid mindless action that confuses motion with progress.5. ListeningHearing is an involuntary process.You cannot turn off your ears.Listening, on the other hand, is a voluntary process that requires intention.It only occurs when you focus on a sound.Remember:Hearing is purely physical. Listening requires your mind.6. FeedbackCriticism only cares about the problem.Feedback only cares about the growth that's required to attain the solution.Focus on the one that will move you forward.7. Self-WorthNet Worth is the culmination of your financial endeavors.Self-Worth is the culmination of the opinion you have of yourself.They have nothing to do with one another.But because one is easier to measure, and therefore manage, it's the one we tend to focus on.This is a mistake, because the most important things in life cannot be measured on a spreadsheet.""

ThinkLabs autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.

Powerhouse Ventures is proud to co-lead ThinkLabs $5M Seed with Active Impact Investments, with additional participation from Blackhorn Ventures, Amplify Capital, Mercuria, and a national US energy company.

"It was fantastic to visit Octopus Energy this week to see some of the exciting work they're doing to roll out low carbon technologies to customers and enable net zero. Domestic engagement is going to be key to meeting net zero targets and heat and transport are the two big-win areas.

Making sure customers can connect these net zero technologies is a priority for both companies and so we've entered into a new partnership to speed up the installation of heat pumps and other technologies. This new way of working allows Octopus engineers to upgrade supply fuses on the incoming network when they are carrying out an installation, reducing the connections process by up to ten weeks for customers. This is a great example of our ongoing collaboration with Octopus and I can't wait to see what comes next.

By integrating SAP, we are equipped to scale effectively, enhance our data-driven decision-making, accelerate month-end closures, and harness the power of AI.

A major milestone for us has been the on-schedule launch of our SAP S/4HANA system. This success was not solely technological; it was a collective effort underpinned by adherence to best practices and, crucially, the unwavering support from senior leadership, our user groups, and the project team.

We got a massive speedup on progress, yet the expectations seem to be that we should be solving all of [fill in your favorite massive challenge for humankind] in a week. No, a day. Yesterday!Can we calm down, please? AI is just another approach to automation. Automation is not new and it's not ""solved.""There is so much good stuff in the AI space, but reality doesn't read like a cheap sci-fi paperback. Whatever you're seeing in the tech news either usually took years or is smoke and mirrors. My team and I spend a lot of time thinking about how long things would take in a perfect world where we had a perfect technology in our hands. (No one has that. And if I ever say something else in a pitch, it's time to put me out of my misery.)There's always plenty to solve that's not about the tech. The most important part isn't what we *can* do. The most important part is what we *should* do and why we should do it and for whom... ""You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.... It has to start with 'What incredible benefits can we give to the customer?' Not 'let's sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then figure out how we can market that.""

People have been promised magic, but LLMs are still just a tool! They can drive incredible results *and* they are imperfect tools that need a lot more work.Remember your audience and what problem you're trying to solve. Selling to enterprise? Consider their scalability and security needs. Selling to developers? Consider their savvy and how they'll use your product.Consumers are smart. They want things that actually solve problems.

" At Lumos, we raised a $35m Series B from Scale Venture Partners with Andreessen Horowitz, Neo and Harpoon Ventures participating. 

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

However, the reality is quite different. The most successful and effective leaders don't try to outshine everyone else by being know-it-alls. Instead, they rely on their team's collective knowledge, expertise, and experience to make informed decisions and drive their organization toward success. These leaders understand that they don't have to be the smartest person in the room to lead effectively. They recognize their strengths and weaknesses and work with their team to fill the gaps in their knowledge and skill set.

Rather, we're here to make sure these new tools in the toolbox are deployed to solve the most pressing and persistent challenges in our field.""As our team grows and our remit expands, I'm conscious that this singular focus on harnessing the promise of digital technology to improve lives becomes more challenging. And this is why we must have a patient role on staff. Not a series of patient focus groups paid in stale bagels and indifference, but a paid position that combines a voice in strategic decision-making with tactical input to our programming and influence over our messaging and storytelling. It is hard showing up at work every day and holding yourself and each other to a standard of promoting innovation to improve lives. This team does it brilliantly, even on the hard days, and this Patient-in-Residence role will help us stay focused and help us deliver. Grace will make us better.

"Pea in a pod? Chickpea! hashtag#WeekendVibesI must admit, for someone who enjoys Chole/Chana Masala and Hummus/Falafel I had never seen green Chickpeas in the pod. The desi "" kala chana' yes - but "" kabuli chana' - no. Dried yes, canned yes, but green - not until today. Figuring out how we are going to use it led to a discussion about the times in hashtag#India when dried chickpeas weren't as readily available - due to entire crops being wiped out by disease. Chickpeas are an excellent source of carbohydrate, protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and a nutritious staple in many diets around the world which makes them key to global nutritional security. Worldwide productivity of pulses has been stagnant for the last five decades, contributing to low availability of these foods. Can the disease resistance be bolstered? And resistance to changing climate? Will the coming generations be able to enjoy them? A little digging shows that work has begun - hashtag#scientists are assembling the genome at sequence level and recommending genomic breeding strategies. hashtag#Diversity matters - it's a matter of survival.

Without it, you will lose control of your application and will struggle to debug any arising issues.Luckily, a number of companies have realized this and started building LLMOps platforms. While they all try to help you improve your applications, they vary in their approaches and the features they deliver.Below I am comparing 4 popular LLMOps platforms to help you find out which is best for you: LangSmith, Langfuse (YC W23), orq.ai, and Comet.YY i  Y o : The LLMOps platform by the popular LLM framework LangChain. As you would expect, if you are using LangChain, this platform integrates very seamlessly and provides great analytics. The main downside in my opinion is its lack of customizability, when it comes to versioning and reporting metrics.Ya Y 3  2: An open-source LLMOps platform that focuses on open integration with all kinds of frameworks (e.g., langflow, litellm, langchain etc.). It is most developer-focused out of the 4. It is developing rapidly with new features being added on a weekly basis.Y 34 2  : A fully enterprise-focused solution. Orquesta is a no-code solution that natively integrates with vector databases and LLM providers to make experimentation and monitoring even easier. They currently do not support all open-source models.a i  14o2  Y: An established platform that also handles traditional MLOps. It is the most customizable as you have all the custom graphs and experiments you could use in MLOps. However, it has the fewest LLM-focused features making it more difficult to quickly get started and run experiments.Bear in mind, that all these applications are very novel and are developing rapidly. Moreover, there are more LLMOps tools popping up every day and it will be exciting to see how this field develops.What are you experiences with LLMOps?

She was an early PM of FigJam, is currently leading a new (undisclosed) product that's launching at Figma's Config conference this year, and is beloved by everyone who works with her.In our conversation, we discuss:  Advice for taking ideas from 0 to 1 at larger companies  How to craft a compelling vision  How to tactically communicate your vision  The importance of vulnerability and feedback  Advice for building a strong team culture  Pivoting priorities with grace and enthusiasm  AI and its impact on PMs  Much moreListen now YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gMed2MdGSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gbNUk-ZcApple: https://lnkd.in/gNb4pBDyKey takeaways:1. Putting ideas out there, even if they are wrong, can lead to better solutions and more productive discussions. It's not just about having a great idea or building a prototype; it's about actively engaging and rallying others around that idea to create momentum and excitement. Whether it's pitching ideas at events like hackathons or simply asking colleagues for assistance, the key is to not let perceived limitations hold you back from pursuing your vision.2. Mihika likens the role of a 0-to-1 team within a large company to that of Hestia in Greek mythology, who is the keeper of the hearth. It is Hestia's job to always keep the hearth burning, even while other gods go out on separate quests. This means always keeping the 0-to-1 project alive and helping it spread to others, mostly through setting vision and building hype.3. To set the vision for a new idea, ask: If I and my team do our job correctly, what does the world look like? Then convey the pain point, solution, and proof in a format that can show, not tell stakeholders what you're doing. For example, use prototypes, Figma mock-ups, and customer testimonials.4. Internal hackathons are a great way to encourage innovation. Figma has a Maker Week where the entire companyincluding technical and non-technical employeesgoes on pause for a week to work on ambitious ideas. Maker Week and other internal hackathons have led to many successful Figma products, including Jambot and Figma's entire widget platform.5. Figma implements a fun hot seat tradition, where each person takes turns being in the hot seat for a set amount of time. During their turn, the person can be asked anything by the other members of the group. By understanding what motivates each team member and building strong relationships, collaboration becomes more effective, leading to a more enjoyable work environment and ultimately better outcomes for the product or project.

I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection.

Aside form lead investor Altimeter, Parloas Series B round included cash injections from EQT Ventures, Newion, Senovo, Mosaic Ventures and La Familia Growth. Todays funding brings Parloas total capital raised to-date to $98 million, following its $21 million Series A funding round led by EQT Ventures in 2023.

Parloa is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI with everything hype that has hit fever pitch these past couple of years, as companies seek new ways to improve efficiency through automation.

Founded out of Germany in 2018, Parloa has already secured high-profile customers such as European insurance giant Swiss Life and sporting goods retailer Decathlon, which use the Parloa platform to automate customer communications including emails and instant messaging.

However, voice is where co-founder and CEO Malte Kosub reckons Parloa stands out.

Our strategy has always been centered around voice first, the most critical and impactful facet of the customer experience, Kosub told TechCrunch over email. As a result, Parloas AI-based voice conversations sound more human than any other solution.

It's not about being data driven, it's about being value driven.2. Design thinking and data science are 2 sides of the same coin. By applying design thinking methodologies, such as empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration, organizations can develop data-driven solutions that truly resonate with users and deliver value.3. Focus on 10% of your data that has 90% of the value. When breaking down business problems into desired outcomes and KPI's, you will start to notice the same KPI's coming up over and over again. Focus on those KPI's.4. AI initiatives need to start small and address a real business problem. 5. Let your voice be heard as the world of AI evolves. It's not too late to affect change. Write to legislators. Stay educated. Highly recommend Bill's books especially "" The Economics of Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation'.

"With the disbanding of the ""superalignment"" team at OpenAI, there is now doomsday talk of a ""superintelligent"" AI. In my view, ""superintelligent"" AI is the boogeyman that keeps the kids (us) in check. 

With every new release of GPT, I am more convinced that these models are only getting sharper in their perception abilities. I have not seen any real signs of cognition. In our work at samvid.ai , we find that GPT-4o can't even reason at the level of an analyst who has spent 6 months on the job. It can, of course, behave like a rookie analyst who has just graduated from school because it has memorized the textbooks.

The easiest questions / instructions to pose to GPT are either the general (take this spreadsheet and tell me something about it) or the very specific (run a regression on these columns). Anything ambiguous and in-between and even the latest GPT-4o fails miserably. I call this the ""valley of confusion"" of LLMs. But this is where humans excel given their tribal knowledge and experience. True cognitive systems should convert large chunks of this latent human expertise into action while utilizing the LLMs as a way to perceive the world. Our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences are a strong step towards accomplishing this goal.

"Could machine learning help predict outcomes in kidney cancer treatment? Although a combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapies show promise in managing metastatic renal cell carcinoma, Yale Medicine describes, accurately predicting responses to these treatments poses a significant challenge. Building upon a clinical trial that identified seven distinct molecular subtypes with unique biological characteristics, Yale Cancer Center investigators are working to differentiate the molecular subgroups of RCC tumors to better understand how their makeup could impact treatment responses. Harnessing artificial intelligence, researchers could determine the distinct biological states for each molecular subtype, and observed that some patients had a different response to the immunotherapy based on their molecular subtype.

"Having started out as an engineer but built my career as an architect, I often come across the question, how technical should enterprise architects be? The answer is...YES! Enterprise Architecture isn't just about strategic alignment, technology vision, efficiency/cost reduction, and managing risk. We also have to be deeply knowledgeable about the tech stacks that drive our enterprise strategy. Case in point, take a look at how the ChatGPT team tackled scaling.
 
If you throw a rock on Linkedin, you're bound to hit a post on #GenAI. Most of these showcase the potential of the buzzworthy technology, but few actually dig into the details on what makes it work. Evan Morikawa from OpenAI presents a refreshing overview of the technical scaling challenges the ChatGPT team had to overcome to create the ""magic"" that everybody is so excited about. Traditional cloud scaling techniques and practices no longer apply since GPU hardware availability is a bottleneck and roundtrip latency is less important. Optimizing batch-sizes and balancing cache and GPU utilization is crucial to optimize efficiency. The architecture needs to continually evolve as demand rises and hardware remains a limiter. 
 
I can't help but find parallels between this and how I think about Enterprise Architecture. The lowest implementation details really does matter to the higher level architecture and approaches. Without understanding exactly why traditional scaling practices no longer applied, we cannot draw up a proper solution and system architecture. In turn, it affects our Enterprise Data and Cloud strategies, which then informs our investment and budget areas, risk...etc, you get the idea. ",AI or Machine Learning

"Today we are announcing that we are the first observability platform to integrate with NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices). This announcement continues our strategy of extending our AI investment, and follows previous announcements of AI monitoring, New Relic (our GenAI Assistant), and AIOps.
 
Several organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI for a variety of use cases, and whether they are in experimentation, limited testing or full scale production, understanding how their AI investment is performing and returning value is critical. That is because running and deploying AI applications is costly and hard to get right. NIM helps this, but often LLMs are a part of the overall application, so New Relic allows you to observe all parts of the application, both AI and non-AI portions. Our investment in NVIDIA NIM allows customers to extend observability to NVIDIAs microservices architecture.

Observability is uniquely suited to solving these challenges for business. This integration further reduces complexity and costs of developing, deploying, and monitoring AI applications. 

Customers can use New Relic AI monitoring to gain a comprehensive view of AI applications built with NVIDIA NIM, along with key metrics on throughput, latency, and costs while ensuring data privacy. 

I am proud that our team is always anticipating and solving for our customers' needs ahead of the market. And there is still so much more to come.

"I'll be publishing my annual predictions for data + AI in hashtag#retail in the next few weeks. One area I predicted - but admittedly nowhere near as strong as we've seen - was the interest in AI such as LLMs. It's on fire because it makes more robust information more accessible to the masses, without technical knowledge. One of the reasons I was hesitant - and still am - has nothing to do with technology. It has to do with data governance, legal rights to data, and control over what is presented to users.OpenAI is highlighting why this is so important.

"We had the privilege of spending the day immersed in the world of data economics with the Dean of Big Data himself Bill Schmarzo. To say we learned a lot is an understatement. Some key takeaways:1. It's not about being data driven, it's about being value driven.2. Design thinking and data science are 2 sides of the same coin. By applying design thinking methodologies, such as empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration, organizations can develop data-driven solutions that truly resonate with users and deliver value.3. Focus on 10% of your data that has 90% of the value. When breaking down business problems into desired outcomes and KPI's, you will start to notice the same KPI's coming up over and over again. Focus on those KPI's.4. AI initiatives need to start small and address a real business problem. 5. Let your voice be heard as the world of AI evolves. It's not too late to affect change. Write to legislators. Stay educated. Highly recommend Bill's books especially "" The Economics of Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation'.

"Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I would like to share with you that on May 20, 2024, our beloved dad, Shan K. Thever, passed away.

Our dad was a vibrant personality, energetic professional and dedicated husband, father and grandfather. He was an inspiration in so many ways and to so many people. 

He came to this country with only a few hundred dollars in his pocket. Through his determination, hard work and tenacity, he successfully completed his undergraduate education at UCLA and received his JD from UCLA School of Law. 

Our dad went on to establish and lead a successful law practice for decades. He was a trailblazer and a pioneer both in and out of the courtroom. He was courageous, took risks and overcame numerous obstacles, and was a preeminent attorney, successfully arguing cases in front of the California Supreme Court. He served as the Director of the Small Law Firm Center at the New York City Bar Association and for the past five years he served as the Deputy County Council for Los Angeles County as a member of the Ethics, Transparency and Legislative Affairs team.

Our dad was a colleague, friend and confidant of Governors, County Supervisors, Council Members and so many others. In addition to numerous awards and appointments, he received the inaugural Trailblazer Award from the South Asian Bar Association and was recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives, receiving a U.S. Congressional Commendation for being an inspiring leader in the South Asian community and a true advocate for political change among the Asian population.

He was an inspiration not only for the professional success he achieved, but also for the way he lived his life. He believed in living a productive and meaningful life, in helping others, in lifting his community and in creating greater opportunity for his children than he had himself. He instilled in us a deep responsibility to, in turn, create greater opportunity for our children and generations to come. He also instilled in us the importance of public service and of being contributing members of society and having a meaningful impact on the world.

In his personal time he loved to be with his family celebrating holidays, cooking together, and discussing politics and current events over a bottle of Cabernet. 

He loved his grandchildren more than anything and was so very proud to see the young people they are and the success they continue to achieve. He was happy to see the wealth of opportunity in front of them. 

While he may not be here in physical form, our dad is always with us. He lived a successful, productive and impactful life, and this world is a better place because of him.

We ask that if you have any special anecdotes, stories or memories about our dad to please share with us via private message.",Not AI or Machine Learning

"A new research article just came out that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson. Do you know it?

A market researcher trained in psychometrics was hired in the 80s by Campbell Soup. His task was to help identify the perfect flavor for Prego brand spaghetti sauce (which was getting beat in the market by Ragu). 

Instead of a single, better-than-Ragu sauce, the researcher identified distinct clusters of customer preferences. His results led to the launch of varied sauces like Chunky, Spicy, and Extra Smooth, which, in turn, led to Prego's sales skyrocketing.

In the new article ( https://buff.ly/3wND6Fv ) published just a few days ago, customer satisfaction researchers identified the drivers of satisfaction in airline travel (the specific drivers they uncovered isnt really the point of this post, but you really want to know what they were, right? OK:

	Inflight entertainment
	Seat comfort
	Online booking
	Online support)

The primary interest of the researchers was whether machine learning algorithms beat traditional logistic regression in identifying satisfaction drivers (yes! Random Forest for the win!). 

But Its the secondary finding that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson:

The satisfaction of one segment of customers was most strongly driven by service quality, while another was most strongly driven by amenities.

In my experience, companies often analyze satisfaction feedback across the customer base as a whole. But that approach often averages out distinct segments in a way that ends up reflecting no one!

If you have open-ended customer feedback and want to identify your customers satisfaction drivers, give me a call. I can help. If you dont collect open-ended customer feedback, give me a call, I can help!   carstendhohnke.com

 While India has more than 20 official languages and a multitude of regional languages and dialects, AI holds immense potential for preserving and revitalizing endangered languages. This technology can be used to create language learning tools, analyze historical texts, and even generate new content in these languages.

 Additionally, we explored how AI can help revolutionize spiritual content based on our rich cultural legacy and a vast collection of manuscripts. We also delved into the question of whether AI can truly help mankind, particularly in the realm of emotional or spiritual intelligence.

"AI is coming for drug discovery in a big way.

Xaira is one of this years most richly funded new companies, not only in biotech but across the startup world. 

Historically, theres been a fair amount of luck involved in discovering antibodies, and it is rife with failure  only about 10% of drugs that make it to human testing are ever approved. 

Using AI to make drugs isnt a new idea. Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into earlier startups with little to show for it. And many scientists remain deeply skeptical of de novo antibody generation  using computers to design brand new proteins. 

Xaira and several other new biotechs believe they can change that with new generative AI methods that can design complex molecules from scratch, find new targets, and cut months or even years from the process.

"It seems to me that before ""urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us"" we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat.

Such a misplaced sense of urgency reveals an extremely distorted view of reality.
No wonder the more based members of the organization seeked to marginalize the superalignment group.

It's as if someone had said in 1925 ""we urgently need to figure out how to control aircrafts that can transport hundreds of passengers at near the speed of sound over the oceans.""
It would have been difficult to make long-haul passenger jets safe before the turbojet was invented and before any aircraft had crossed the atlantic non-stop.
Yet, we can now fly halfway around the world on twin-engine jets in complete safety. 
It didn't require some sort of magical recipe for safety.
It took decades of careful engineering and iterative refinements.

The process will be similar for intelligent systems.
It will take years for them to get as smart as cats, and more years to get as smart as humans, let alone smarter (don't confuse the superhuman knowledge accumulation and retrieval abilities of current LLMs with actual intelligence).
It will take years for them to be deployed and fine-tuned for efficiency and safety as they are made smarter and smarter.

"Have you connected your acquisition campaigns to retention/churn rates? You may be surprised by the results.

A seasoned lifecycle marketer once told me that the key to unlocking retention can often come from the right acquisition strategy.

They needed a strategy to attract new users and build a community that encouraged return buyers and sellers. To accomplish that, they partnered with GrowthLoop to leverage #BigQuery and activate their predictive models to drive retention. 

Together, GrowthLoop and Mercari....

 Used predictions to identify retention features, and then built out initial segment definitions based on those features. 

 From there, the Mercari team used the results to design and launch experiments with GrowthLoop, refining audiences based on performance

 Mercaris marketing team could now build their own customer lists using predictive models without requiring continuous support from other teams. This drove major retention and revenue lift impacts.

Focusing on churn with data science, automated activation, and consistent experimentation was the key to unlocking retention.

"What a fantastic Fireside chat with Lorraine Bardeen, Corporate VP and CTO of Microsoft! 

Gracias, Lorraine, for sitting down with Miriam Hernandez-Kakol, HITEC Vice Chair, to share your thoughts on leadership, change management, authenticity and being AI ready! 

Lorraine provided us with powerful nuggets of information, such as: 
- Take a chance on yourself, show courage  20 seconds of confidence can go a long way! 
- Break through certainty and consider the counterpoint; spend energy on what you dont know. 
- Modeling is a core part of how we lead people, walk the walk! 
- Use your platform to share your authentic self and invite others to join you. 

The characteristic that makes her a better leader is connecting people to ideas, which help deliver results. The other is modeling and showing vulnerability, creating environments where people can feel comfortable not knowing what to do so that change can happen. People need knowledge (skilling) and to feel safe to try something new.  Make your team feel safe and give them space to do so, this will enable change management. 

To be AI ready, leaders must know where to spend time and energy.  Is it: 
- Revitalizing and energizing customer experience? 
- Enriching your employee experience? 
- Reshaping business processes that are clunky, repetitive, and redundant? 
- Bending the curve on innovation? 
(HINT: Start with #4!) 

The session closed out by speaking about authenticity and intersectionality: Every person in this room has intersectionality. The bigger your platform, the more you talk out loud and pull people with you to create psychological safety. Our hope is that no one needs to wait to have a platform to show constant authenticity and claim their identity.

"What does Bruce Lee, the greatest martial artist of all time, have to do with Enterprise Architecture? Last week, I had the honor to be the keynote speaker at IQPC's Chief AI Officer Exchange in Fort Lauderdale, where I explored the evolution of Enterprise Architecture and the skillset required to be a ""Full-stack"" Architect. 
 
Bruce Lee's famous quote on being ""like water"", showcases his philosophy on his martial art style, to be flexible and adapt. While I'm not saying architects go to combat (although sometimes it feels that way  ), flexibility and the adaptability is also one of the key skillsets to be an effective architect, and is a quality that is foundational to be a Full-stack architect. Architecture is a fluid space and the value we bring to the organization, while immense, hinges on our ability to adjust to change, as we work with a variety of stakeholders across the Enterprise.

"BIG NEWS - The AI Act has been agreed! AI Act implications:1. Risk-Based Tiered System: For AI systems classified as high-risk, clear obligations were agreed. A mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment will now be required. 2. Foundation models will be regulated, following President Biden's Executive Order approach, it will apply to models whose training required 10^25 flops of compute power - basically the largest of the large language models. 3. The following systems will be prohibited with just six months for companies to ensure compliance:aai biometric categorisation systems that use sensitive characteristics (e.g. political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race);aai untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases;aai emotion recognition in the workplace and educational institutions;aai social scoring based on social behaviour or personal characteristics;aai AI systems that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent their free will;aai AI used to exploit the vulnerabilities of people (due to their age, disability, social or economic situation).4: High Risk AI systems are subject to transparency requirements.5. High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to manage biases effectively, ensuring that they are non-discriminatory and respect fundamental rights.6. Providers of high-risk AI systems must maintain thorough documentation to demonstrate their compliance with the regulation. This includes records of programming and training methodologies, data sets used, and measures taken for oversight and control.7. The AI Act requires human oversight for high-risk systems to minimise risks, ensuring that human discretion is part of the AI system's deployment.8. Sanctions: Non-compliance can lead to substantial fines, ranging from a35 million or 7% of global turnover to a7.5 million or 1.5% of turnover, depending on the infringement and company size.Businesses heavily invested in technologies now deemed prohibited, such as biometric categorisation and emotion recognition, may face the need for major strategic shifts. Additionally, enhanced transparency requirements might challenge the protection of intellectual property, necessitating a balance between disclosure and maintaining trade secrets.Companies may also need to invest in higher-quality data and advanced bias management tools, potentially increasing operational costs but enhancing AI system fairness and quality.The documentation and record-keeping requirements will impose a significant administrative burden, potentially affecting the time to market for new AI products.Integrating human oversight into high-risk AI systems will require system design and deployment changes, along with potential staff training.The substantial fines for non-compliance represent a significant financial risk.The rubber has hit the road.

Spoiler alert!!  most of the conversations were centered around how to properly adopt GenAI and discussions about Cybersecurity.  Big focus as well on the CIO's role to foster more cross-team collaboration which I thought was excellent to hear!  Here are some of the key points discussed in most of the talks given.  Enjoy!1. 2z zYzz s s zs   -   John Russell emphasized the necessity of collaborative cyber defense, framing it as a team sport. This concept highlights the importance of working together for effective cybersecurity.2. s s 2z      zz - Jonny LeRoy discussed the synergy between humans and systems in both offense and defense. The combination of human expertise and technology was highlighted as a powerful approach.Y. sz s  z z z - Monica Caldas emphasized the importance of talent development, describing it in terms of moving from ladders to jungle gyms. She also stressed the need to focus on specific skill areas.  She had the most innovative thoughts(from my perspective) on how to retrain employees to enable the existing teams to level up and move into new roles that are being created because of AI. Y. Yz z s   s  - Katya Andresen has taken the time to study Generative AI and came up with an analogy that we all felt makes a lot of sense.  She mentioned ChatGPT is like having access to ""infinite interns"" and learning to treat GenAI tools as you would having unlimited interns working for you.Y. ' zz -s    zs - Paul Beswick discussed how AI can change the perception of technology organizations by quickly delivering surprising value, focusing on mechanisms to achieve this effectively.  He talked about how they have built their own private GenAI tool and have rolled it out to all 90K employees which allows them to know exactly where the data is being stored and allows their employees to play around with this tool in a safe place and innovate without putting security at risk.Y. ss z 2 zz s  - Cynthia (Cindy) Stoddard talked about the idea of ""nutrition labels"" for data assets, emphasizing the need for data hygiene and building trust in AI-driven decision-making processes.Y.   2z  Y  2zz s  z zzz- Prakash Kota highlighted the relationship between employee and customer experiences, emphasizing the importance of this virtuous cycle.Y. s-zzz  s - Nicholas Parrotta emphasized keeping humans at the center of the conversation and the value of domain experts in technology decisions.Going to add 4 more key points later as I ran out of room! hashtag#forbes hashtag#cioinfluence hashtag#cybersecurity",AI or Machine Learning

I had the pleasure of working with these three brilliant people in their Tel Aviv co-working space as we wrestled to make the complex problem Deci AI (Acquired by NVIDIA) solved easy to understand (well easier, anyway ), built their initial marketing materials -- web site, deck, white paper, case study...you know the drill -- and take their first steps out into the world. 

Remember that back then, hardly anyone knew what an LLM or generative AI was, or the massive resources it took to make them run efficiently. So we were inventing a language. And the talented Arik Mergi helped bring that language to life visually. 

Four years is an eternity in startup-time, and naturally, Deci and its marketing grew and evolved so much since we worked together in those early days, with Rachel Salkin at the helm.

"This week, Google announced a doubling of Gemini Pro 1.5's input context window from 1 million to 2 million tokens, and OpenAI released GPT-4o, which generates tokens 2x faster and 50% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo and natively accepts and generates multimodal tokens. I view these developments as the latest in an 18-month trend, which is shifting prompting best practices for developers as well.

Since ChatGPT's launch in Nov 2022, newer models like GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3-70B have given us better capabilities in two important ways: (i) reasoning, which allows LLMs to think through complex concepts and and follow complex instructions; and (ii) longer input context windows. 

The reasoning capability of advanced models makes them quite good at interpreting complex prompts with detailed instructions. Many people are used to dashing off a quick, 1- to 2-sentence query to an LLM. In contrast, when building applications, I see sophisticated teams frequently write prompts that might be 1 to 2 pages long (my teams call them mega-prompts) that specify in detail how wed like an LLM to perform a task. I still see teams not going far enough in terms of writing detailed instructions. For an example of a moderately lengthy prompt, take a look at Claude 3s system prompt. Its detailed and gives clear guidance for Claude's behavior. 

This is a very different prompting style than we typically use with LLMs web user interfaces, where we might dash off a quick query and, if the response is unsatisfactory, clarify what we want through repeated conversational turns with the chatbot.

The increasing length of input context windows has added another technique to the developers toolkit. GPT-3 kicked off a lot of work on few-shot in-context learning. For example, for text classification, you might give the LLM a handful  say 1 to 5 examples  of texts and their class labels as context. With longer input context windows  GPT-4o accepts 128,000 input tokens, Claude 3 Opus 200,000 tokens, and Gemini 1.5 Pro 1 million tokens (2 million just announced). With many-shot learning, we can give dozens, even hundreds of examples in the prompt, and this works better than few-shot. 

When building complex workflows, I see developers getting good results with this process: 
- Write quick, simple prompts and see how it does.
- Based on where the output falls short, flesh out the prompt iteratively. This  leads to a longer, more detailed, prompt, perhaps even a mega-prompt.
- If thats still insufficient, consider few-shot or many-shot learning (if applicable) or, less frequently, fine-tuning.
- If that still doesnt yield the results you need, break down the task into subtasks and apply an agentic workflow.

If youre interested a deeper dive into prompting strategies, I recommend the Medprompt paper (Nori et al., 2023), which lays out a complex set of prompting strategies.

"The AI revolution is in full swing, but where are the women? In some of the most recent AI panels, discussions and summits I have been at women are sorely underrepresented. It was so stark that some of the men at these events even made comments about it. Which I really appreciated because we absolutely need their support with remedying this issue. This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

As a data person, I needed some baseline data!! A survey by Junior Achievement (JA) conducted by the research group Engine shows that only 9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle nudging.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease.

"There is a special club that no parent ever wants to join""the one where you have lost a child. There is an even smaller club for parents who have lost a child to suicide. While parents who have lost a child to a physical illness openly talk about it, when a parent loses a child to suicide, it is spoken about in hushed tones.What is the difference between losing a child to a physical illness compared to a mental illness? How it is spoken about! But why? They are both illnesses. When I lost my son, Langdon, to suicide, I made a promise to myself and to Langdon that I wouldn't speak in hushed tones.In the last almost 2  12 years since Langdon's death, I have been asked to speak to a friend of a friend or the sibling of a friend who has lost a child to suicide more times than should be allowed. Because of this and because of Langdon, I have changed the direction of my life to helping those who suffer from mental health issues or those who care for them.Why am I posting this today?

"BS-Meter for GenerativeAI (in enterprise setting) - an attempt at calling the bluff Y Z3 weeks of whirlwind conversations with CIOs (thankful and gasping for breath!). Sharing early rushesA. The hype is real but this wave (we are calling it Wave 1) of investments are being channeled primarily into 2 buckets 1. Embedded stacks (offered by stack providers - MSFT, SFDC, and others) 2. Micro-utilities (Customized proofs of concept focused on company-specific use cases, largely in walled-garden secured ""lab environments"")B. Some suppliers and buyers are throwing caution to the wind when it comes to using GenAI as a motherhood term for AI. Here is a quick way to spot BS in the claims that you see floating around YZ GenAI output is probabilisticWhenever you see anyone claim that it can solve a deterministic (that requires accuracy, a decision tree) use case, call out the BS. For example, ""GenAI to craft regulatory submissions"". Note: Most deterministic use cases are best suited for machine learning, not GenAI YZ  GenAI requires human in the loopGenAI creates (text, images, and even voice). However, end products need human ownership (creator for emails, doctor for clinical notes, presenter for powerpoints) for both legal liability and accuracy check. BS example: ""You can use our GenAI product to replace your customer agent"".  YZ  GenAI productivity is proportional to digital maturityGenAI can significantly improve cycle times in product engineering (code generation, testing, refactoring of applications). However, this productivity is true only for stacks that have ""agility"", ""time to market"", etc. as key goals. For legacy engineering stacks and legacy organizations, GenAI is just like a Ferrari on potholed country roads. YZ  GenAI has ""creative potential""How many workflows and tasks in enterprise scenario actually require creativity? Enterprises prefer to work within defined guardrails of legal and compliance. Sure creativity is needed but in context. For example, its a win for a fiction author if the tool shapes the story of a drug extension to solve for ageing; it could be legal liability if the tool writes the marketing collateral for a drug on clinical trial YZ  GenAI needs a value equation (soon!)GenAI is great. However, the hype is being confused for value. As clients expand on micro-utilities (see above) it is clear that they have questions on opportunity cost, value calculation, and better price/solution discovery through specialized procurement. None of these questions have ready answers yetAll you folks (yes, you too!) claiming things about GenAI, I am watching you!

"AI was at the forefront of many conversations at hashtag#ViVE2024. As an industry, we've moved beyond talking about the potential of AI to experimenting with the practical applications. Some insights from the conference: 1. As AI solutions continue to evolve, we can't afford to let governance take a backseat. Many enterprise healthcare organizations are using AI, with some managing more than 100 different AI-related programs and use cases.Having a consistent framework for managing AI applications is essential. Health2047 Managing Director Judy Barkal is currently taking questions on AI governance for our Ask an Expert series. Submit them here: https://lnkd.in/ey7_hZWa. 2. Nearly a year has passed since the launch of GPT-4 and the explosion of AI solutions across industries. The takeaway at ViVE was loud and clear: now is the time to start evaluating the value and performance of these solutions.Health2047 portfolio company Evidium recently was invited along with other tech companies by a prospective customer to test how AI could be used to understand thousands of chart snippets and map clinical knowledge found to the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model. In 82% of instances, Evidium outperformed the three other solutions evaluated. We need more tools for public validation. 3. AI has tremendous potential to improve productivity and reduce burnout for healthcare practitioners. At the American Medical Association's Physician Innovation Network panel, panelists talked about the importance of viewing burnout as a systemic problem, rather than an individual shortcoming. AI solutions can help augment decision support across the continuum of care and address these issues at scale, but it's important for them to keep the physician at the center.The Health2047 team is at booth 1038.

"Ready, Set, AI!

Approximately eighteen months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, we are witnessing the rapid ascension of artificial intelligence across various sectors. The term AI has become a ubiquitous buzzword in technology, frequently appearing in pitch decks, management meetings, and boardrooms globally. Recent reports indicating that OpenAI is generating approximately $3.4 billion in annual revenue underscore the profound impact and economic potential of this technology.

At Aliya Capital Partners, we are optimistic about the future of AI, though we remain judicious in our investment selections. We believe AI holds transformative potential, heralding a paradigm shift in multiple facets of life and business. The global AI market is projected to grow from $94 billion in 2021 to $998 billion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40%. Major industries, including healthcare, finance, and logistics, are increasingly integrating AI to enhance efficiency and innovation. We are already seeing how AI-driven diagnostics in healthcare are improving patient outcomes, while algorithmic trading in finance is optimizing investment strategies.

Moreover, AI advancements are contributing to significant cost savings and productivity gains. A McKinsey report suggests that AI could deliver up to $13 trillion in additional global economic activity by 2030, boosting global GDP by about 1.2% annually.",AI or Machine Learning
"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

"Every successful startup I've been a part of had a 10x coder. (Despite my best efforts, I was not one.)These elite programmers are hard to find and even harder to hire. Yet everyday engineers are now completing tasks much faster as generative AI-assisted coding has spread like wildfire. Half of developers in 2023 used tools like GitHub Copilot X  and Meta just released a major update to its code generation AI model Code Llama.It raises the question: Can anyone become a 10x coder now? The answer: Not yet.A new four-year study analyzed 150+ million changed lines of code and found code churn (i.e., the % of lines reverted or updated <2 weeks weeks after being authored) is projected to double in 2024 compared to the pre-AI baseline in 2021.In short, productivity is up, but quality is down.At Kyber Knight Capital, we believe we've entered a new era of ""augmented intelligence"" where companies can leverage software to enhance the capabilities of human workers.As you'd expect at the dawn of any new paradigm shift, there will be bumps in the road. But I am still bullish on GenAI as the future of software development,  especially as free tools like Code Llama democratize access to AI-powered programming.As LLMs improve the code they spit out over time, and developers become better acquainted with the optimal use cases (and limitations) of these tools, I expect the adoption of augmented coding to continue to rise.",AI or Machine Learning

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what theyre seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. Im honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsofts LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a whole-slide foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by looking at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and were making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool thatll help that human with a microscope see things they didnt realize were there.

Im hugely proud of this work and grateful for the opportunity to support it.

I covered four key points.
 
First  Common cases for AI. These include improving the customer experience, better network planning and response to issues, and supporting employees by, for example, generating code.
 
Second  Prepare for AI. Create a data strategy and an investment case. Start with pilot projects and ensure seamless integration with existing systems and processes. And most importantly, implement ethical guidelines and monitor AI performance and outcomes.
 
Third  Partnerships. Work with hyperscalers to gain access to the latest AI tech, improve cost efficiency, focus on core business functions, and accelerate innovation, all while ensuring robust security and compliance.
 
Fourth  Balance the risk of being too early vs too late. Thoroughly evaluate pilot programs, collaborate, and share experiences with partners.
 
Ultimately AI must meet our purpose, which is to connect people securely, safely and with their privacy as a priority.

"What are 2 2 1   o2 2 s22 14 (s)    2o ?Here is an example of a simple RAG based Chatbot to query your Private Knowledge Base.First step is to store the knowledge of your internal documents in a format that is suitable for querying. We do so by embedding it using an embedding model:Y: Split text corpus of the entire knowledge base into chunks - a chunk will represent a single piece of context available to be queried. Data of interest can be from multiple sources, e.g. Documentation in Confluence supplemented by PDF reports.Y: Use the Embedding Model to transform each of the chunks into a vector embedding.Y : Store all vector embeddings in a Vector Database.Y: Save text that represents each of the embeddings separately together with the pointer to the embedding (we will need this later).Next we can start constructing the answer to a question/query of interest:Y: Embed a question/query you want to ask using the same Embedding Model that was used to embed the knowledge base itself.Y2: Use the resulting Vector Embedding to run a query against the index in the Vector Database. Choose how many vectors you want to retrieve from the Vector Database - it will equal the amount of context you will be retrieving and eventually using for answering the query question.Y3: Vector DB performs an Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search for the provided vector embedding against the index and returns previously chosen amount of context vectors. The procedure returns vectors that are most similar in a given Embedding/Latent space. Y : Map the returned Vector Embeddings to the text chunks that represent them.Y: Pass a question together with the retrieved context text chunks to the LLM via prompt. Instruct the LLM to only use the provided context to answer the given question. This does not mean that no Prompt Engineering will be needed - you will want to ensure that the answers returned by LLM fall into expected boundaries, e.g. if there is no data in the retrieved context that could be used make sure that no made up answer is provided.To make it a real Chatbot - face the entire application with a Web UI that exposes a text input box to act as a chat interface. After running the provided question through steps 1. to 9. - return and display the generated answer. This is how most of the chatbots that are based on a single or multiple internal knowledge base sources are actually built nowadays.There are many caveats you might face while building RAG Systems, I'll cover them in the following weeks.--------Follow me to upskill in hashtag#MLOps, hashtag#MachineLearning, hashtag#DataEngineering, hashtag#DataScience and overall hashtag#Data space.14'  314 2   14 1 2 Y,  2  14oo2 !Join a growing community of Data Professionals by subscribing to my 2  12  2/114 .",AI or Machine Learning
"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not AI or Machine Learning

"Falling in love with the problem, before jumping into solutions, helps you go slow to go fast. It creates a deep understanding of the challenge...  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders... how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent... how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within... saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

"""Lost in Translation"" with ML Papers? Let's Train a Baby LLaMA TM from Scratch! Ever caught yourself nodding at abstracts and glossing over diagrams, all the while feeling that pang of missing out on the real essence of a research paper? You're not alone!I remember a time when ML research papers felt like deciphering a third language (and not in a fun way). Abstract? Easy. Intro and related works? Smooth sailing. But by the time I dove deep into the techniques and mathematical proofs, I felt more like an amateur detective looking for clues than a confident ML enthusiast.  But to truly wield the power of these papers and evolve as an exceptional ML engineer, you don't just need to READ, you need to IMPLEMENT. And that's where the magic happens.   On today's agenda: Transforming all that abstract understanding into tangible skills! I've decoded and broken down the process of implementing a model end-to-end, using the LLaMA paper as a reference. The cherry on top?

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process.

"Earlier this year, some AWS developers created an internal tool for Amazonians to experiment with Foundation Models from Amazon Bedrock, and it quickly became a word-of-mouth hit across AWS.Because the interface only required a user to add in a description of the app they wanted to build in a prompt box, the tool could be used by teammates across a wide spectrum of roles and technical expertise.Some built apps for productivity, while others made ones for amusement, or that tapped into personal passions. It was cool to see builders get inspired by using generative AI in a more hands on way, and by sharing their apps with each other, they were actually sharing key generative AI techniques in action.Based on the popularity and feedback, we launched this simple to use but powerful app to the world for free, naming it PartyRock (in reference to it being a fun and collaborative  way to experience Amazon Bedrock). It is built on the belief that everyone should have access to a fun and easy tool to help get started with generative AI.Since launching it last week, tens of thousands of apps have been built and shared, and the creativity has been really cool to see (including apps to organize your re:Invent schedule, plan a Formula 1 trip, and find the best coffee in Vegas).
