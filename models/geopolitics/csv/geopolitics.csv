"Over the past few days, the scope of the atrocities carried out against Israel and its citizens have become clearer and more horrific. I know I am not alone when I express my shock and grief about the ongoing situation. I can scarcely imagine the full magnitude of what people are experiencing there: civilians of all ages targeted and killed in cold blood, hostages taken and tortured, victims paraded through the streets, and so much more. It is not enough to condemn these actionsâ€”we ourselves must take action.
To help support urgent and humanitarian health needs in the region, The Pfizer Foundation has launched a donation campaign to support several key organizations that are working to provide critical emergency assistance in the region, and Pfizer will match all colleague donations made through this campaign. The Pfizer Foundation is also in active discussions with our partner NGOs on the ground to determine if additional financial support is required. And we continue to work with our global network of humanitarian and logistics partners to assess the need for medicines and vaccines, and are ready to provide support where needed.
Personally, I am heartbroken by the atrocities we have witnessed, and over the last few days, I have been on the phone constantly with friends and relatives in Israel. My prayers continue to be with them and with the people of Israel.

"Iâ€™m heartbroken to hear the terrible news of war in Israel and grief-stricken by the loss of life, the threat to safety, and the fear and uncertainty that has invaded our shared community.
At Pfizer, we are committed to protecting and saving lives, and dedicated to the health and well-being of people around the world. Actions that are geared towards inflicting bloodshed, harm and death are antithetical to our work and to our values. My heart goes out to our Pfizer colleagues in Israel. Today, I shared this message with them:",Geopolitics
"Today, February 24, 2023, marks a somber milestone. Russian forces invaded Ukraine on this day one year ago, triggering a humanitarian crisis that has created ripples of fear, despair and devastation worldwide. Weâ€™ve lost many innocent people, and weâ€™ve watched global geopolitical tension escalate.
When the international community made the decision to implement unprecedented sanctions against Russia, most sanctions and export control restrictions contained exclusions for the provision of medicine. In addition, Pfizer recognized that halting the delivery of medicine, including cancer or cardiovascular therapies, to Russia would cause significant patient suffering and potential loss of life. Ending Pfizer operations in Russia would run counter to our guiding principle of putting patients first.
Yet business in Russia could not then, and cannot now, continue as usual. Last year, on March 14, we announced that Pfizer would donate the equivalent of all profits from our sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Since announcing that commitment, we have committed more than $30 million to 15 unique organizations, each of which provides on-the-ground humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine.
As the war continues, the global community has a responsibility to ensure support to Ukraine continues unabated. We remain hopeful that a peaceful outcome is possible. Our support remains steadfast and consistent with Pfizerâ€™s core values, particularly those of courage, excellence and equity.

"Itâ€™s been a tremendous week with #UNGA78 bringing leaders from all over the world to Pfizerâ€™s hometown of New York City for important discussions on a range of international issues. IFPMA recently hosted a reception focused on delivering innovation for global health security. It was my first external engagement as IFPMA President, and I was energized by the opportunity to discuss the organizationâ€™s pivotal role in advancing global human health. IFPMA represents the biopharmaceutical industryâ€”and its ~5.5 million people worldwideâ€”all of whom are inspired by the notion that no industry can positively impact more people in more places more often than ours.
One of the key lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic was that we must have policies, partnerships and infrastructure in place to help ensure equitable access to medicines and vaccines. The biopharmaceutical industry is focused on finding solutions for the worldâ€™s most devastating diseasesâ€”but there is a huge gap separating those who can access these innovations and those who cannot. The IFPMAâ€™s Berlin Declaration is one way weâ€™re working to help ensure that authorized vaccines and treatments for future pandemics are available and affordable to all countries.
Scientific innovation got us through this last pandemic, and it will help us prepare for the next one. I look forward to working with our IFPMA members and partners to harness our industryâ€™s innovation to help solve the worldâ€™s most pressing health challenges.",Geopolitics

"Letter to Harvard University President Gay:
Dear President Gay:
I am an alumnus of Harvard College 1992, Government. My tutor and thesis advisor was Dame Louise Richardson, who I am sure you know went on to be the head of Oxford and whose academic scholarship is on terrorism. I am also an Israeli citizen and reside in Israel for the past 20 years. This week, my best friends lost their son fighting Hamas terrorists, another colleague lost his elderly parent to Hamas butchery and friends have a son who attended the rave party, was severely wounded and is held in Gaza by Hamas. There were 13 funerals in my relatively small city Raâ€™anana this week alone.
I am deeply troubled by what is missing in your statements around these terrorist events. You condemn the Hamas barbarism, but you speak mostly about listening to each other in the Harvard community. While that is important, now is a time for you as the leader of Harvard to speak much more clearly and forcefully against terror. Harvard does not only exist to foster dialogue among its students. Harvardâ€™s alumni and students, certainly of the Government department and the Law, Business and Kennedy Schools, are and will be leaders of governments, corporations, international organizations, etc. Harvardâ€™s mission is to create actors, not only talkers, on the world stage as a force for good.
In order to do this, as Harvardâ€™s leader you must speak more forcefully and unequivocally. Not just to condemn the barbarism. Your message should be clear and unequivocal, not just to support Israeli victims, but to SAVE GAZA AND THE PALESTINIANS FROM HAMAS! Hamasâ€™s horrific crimes against Israelis this week and over the years are secondary only to their horrific crimes against their own people since their founding. They have singlehandedly (alongside Islamic Jihad) and too effectively prolonged the Palestinian Israeli conflict, wreaked death and destruction among their people all while profiting â€“ be it in capital for their leadership or murderous suicide missions for their nihilistic ideology. They threaten to drag the world into a global conflict. This is all historical truth, not perspective. Harvard must stand for truth.
Palestinians who say that Hamas represent them have made a clear choice â€“ they choose and support terrorism - that Harvard must reject. You can make a difference if you are clearer about the Universityâ€™s position. This is a time for moral clarity to prevail. Harvard is a bastion of education. Harvard leadership should be screaming from the top of its lungs â€“ end the education of hate and antisemitism that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have perpetrated to Palestinian children for decades. Hamas has brought ruin to the Palestinian cause, to the cause of peace and co-existence. That message must be clear to the entire educated world, and you should lead it. Please consult Dame Richardson and her 2006 book What Terrorists Want. There is much to learn from her.

"Fascinating read in the The New York Times on the challenges AI start-ups face in a world where 'hyperscalers' like Google, Microsoft and Amazon control the computing power necessary to develop groundbreaking tech. #AI #StartUps
AI start-ups today need substantial resources to succeed. Companies like Cohere are turning back to their roots at tech giants, buying the necessary computing power to create their own technology. Itâ€™s like the plot of Game of Thrones, according to David Katz from Radical Ventures, with the tech giants deciding who gets the computing power and who doesn't. #Innovation #TechGiants
In an interesting twist, it's open source software that may even the playing field. The recent decision by Meta to open source its large language model is a game changer, enabling anyone to build on it and compete. In the words of Amr Awadallah, â€œHaving the collective minds of every researcher on Earth would beat any company.â€ #OpenSource #FutureOfAI
While Australiaâ€™s defense innovation ecosystem is burgeoning, itâ€™s crucial to consider these international dynamics:
- How can we foster an environment that promotes not just local start-ups, but also the development of advanced tech like AI?
- How can we ensure access to the necessary resources, like computing power, isn't a roadblock for Australian innovators?
- How can we leverage open-source tech to our advantage?

Part of PATHâ€™s mission has always been to help solve the worldâ€™s most pressing health challenges, and I canâ€™t think of a bigger challenge than the recent pandemic.

"I joined the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) Monday morning for a discussion on global competitiveness and innovation at the 21st International Advisory Council Meeting. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong led a great session, and the conversation reinforced a notion Iâ€™ve written a lot about: The need for strong global linkages in a world thatâ€™s dividing.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have found that every region relies on imports for more than 25 percent of at least one good. Strengthening and reimagining these linkages, even amid disruption, could accelerate growth and resilience. You can read more here: https://lnkd.in/gDhu6rVG

"Will we find a way to speed up the net-zero transition? Iâ€™m humble enough to know I donâ€™t have the answer. But breaking down the challenge into actionable objectives is key. Acceleration isnâ€™t about one big moveâ€”itâ€™s about quick, practical moves over a sustained period. Our new report, â€œAn affordable, reliable, competitive path to net zero,â€ lays this out. It offers a framework for turning the aspirations of the Paris Agreement into tangible actionâ€”right now. You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/gsFUeZUt
Last night in Dubai, Word Trade Organization Director-General Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala also offered a practical framework in her opening remarks at our COP28 CEO dinner and panel discussion. She shared five trade-related areas in which private-sector leaders can immediately work to drive climate action, economic growth, and inclusive development. A quick summary:
- Carbon pricing: A more harmonized global approach to carbon pricing and carbon markets could minimize associated trade tensions. - Supply-chain resilience: The private sector can help ensure that supply chain resilience and diversification go hand-in-hand with the green transition.
- Trade-policy reform: Private-sector leaders have a unique opportunity to use their influence to drive policy shifts toward accelerating the transition. - Standards: Private-sector cooperation on climate-related standards, particularly to drive decarbonization in hard-to-abate industries, is an essential ingredient in accelerating the transition. - Innovation: Voluntary licensing and other means could maximize technology diffusion and absorption, improving innovation access, uptake, and the speed of adoption globally.
I had three takeaways from the session. First, measurement and speed are essential in all this. Relying on end-date goals will not get us where we need to be. Letâ€™s instead set near-term goals, and hold ourselves accountable for keeping pace with them along the way. Second, we must continue to find ways to collaborate. No organization or entity alone can solve this challenge. Finally, we must embrace â€˜andâ€™ thinking. This is not about choosing sustainability or inclusion or growth but about pursuing all three at once.

"I start today in Davos for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
Why come to Davos? Because sustainable and inclusive growth won't be realized without collaboration across business, government, and civil society. WEF's annual meeting is one of the few venues at which this type of common purpose can be forged.
The topics on which I will be focusing:
Resilience
Last year we worked with WEF to create the Resilience Consortium, the first serious program aimed at developing a deep understanding of what it takes to create organizations and societies that thrive in the face of external shocks. Today we launched the consortium's second major publication (https://lnkd.in/gunPvi9B).
From a business perspective, we know that resilient companies outperform. The bigger picture is that societies underpinned by resilient institutions are more likely to meet the aspirations of their citizens.
Reimagining globalization
We have a generational opportunity to reimagine globalization to create a system that delivers for everyone, especially the most vulnerable. This will happen only if trading relationships and supply chains are reconfigured in ways that preserve the benefits of international trade. Retreat into isolated national or regional blocs is not the answer.
The McKinsey Global Institute has developed a strong fact base to inform these decisions, including a new installment published last week (https://lnkd.in/gjiwj7Mi).
Sustainability
The world is at a pivotal moment on climate, with business leaders and policymakers tempted prioritize energy security and affordability, even if it means retreating from net-zero goals. While accepting that there are tensions, in my view there is no long-term trade-off between energy security, affordability, and sustainability. Bold action now will enable us to navigate the net-zero transition and also accelerate sustainable growth in future.
Inclusion
Most executives now accept that inclusion can be a competitive advantage. Yet progress towards parity on gender and other dimensions of diversity remains slow even for organizations with major diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The truth is that leaders need greater clarity on what works and what does not.
Our new joint report with WEF (https://lnkd.in/gERz-Dx3) will help by surfacing success factors common across DEI initiatives that have driven significant real-world impact.
Space
Space is emerging as an opportunity in sectors ranging from agriculture to drug development to advanced manufacturing. It is also increasingly important as a source of data to help manage society-wide issues including climate change and food security. Now is the time for collaboration to establish a robust governance framework covering topics such as data sharing, safe operations, and property rights.
#WEF23 #McKinseyAtDavos",Geopolitics
"When I think about what 2023 may hold, I'm struck by how much has changed since this time last year.
Geopolitical tensions have boiled over into Russia's senseless war against Ukraine, while US-China relations have grown increasingly tense. Inflation triggered energy and food security issues, and volatility in global markets. Supply chain issues linger, and now the world watches with a mix of relief and concern as China pivots off its zero-COVID strategy.
Against this background, I won't make predictions for the year ahead except to say that it is likely to be turbulent. Here some thoughts on the kind of leadership that may be required.
1. Balance defensive and offensive priorities. Yes, this is a moment to prioritize efficient and effective use of resources. But it is also a time to look for long-term potential. Make bold moves; build new businesses; use new and better technology to differentiate from competitors; stay the course on the transition to net zero; rethink the future of the workplace for a hybrid world.
Our data shows that leaders who play both offense and defense in troubled times outperform all rivals. (https://lnkd.in/gZYFG3cd)
2. Reimagine globalization. The world's toughest challenges - climate, health, security, innovation â€“ wonâ€™t be solved by countries or even regions in isolation. We are far more interconnected than most people realize, and dismantling globalization would be far more costly than most have imagined. (https://lnkd.in/gDhu6rVG)
Our opportunity is to recognize the faults of globalization as it exists today while finding new avenues to come together across trade, standards, talent, and capital flows. By doing so we can improve access for all, especially the most vulnerable. For business leaders the immediate opportunity is to reimagine the global footprint of their organizations, as opposed to shrinking back to home markets.
3. Lean into the 'and' in sustainable and inclusive growth. I believe sustainability, inclusion, and growth can, and must, reinforce each other - creating a virtuous cycle in which growth provides the resources needed to contain climate change, promote natural capital and biodiversity, empower households, and promote equitable opportunity. (https://lnkd.in/gB_Tuy_D)
Driving sustainable and inclusive growth is far from easy. There are real tensions that need to be addressed. For business leaders the challenge is to take a long-term view on capital, invest in upskilling at scale AND meet climate goals as the energy transition continues. This demands courage, collaboration, and speed.
More on these themes in the weeks and months ahead.",Geopolitics
"This week I returned to Norway for Arendalsuka, or Arendal Week, the annual gathering in Norway dedicated to political empowerment, democracy, and openness.
This was my second time at the event, and I left feeling even more inspired than last year. Why? In three words: resilience, collaboration, and courage.
Geopolitics, climate change, shifting demographics, tech innovation. Navigating any one of these would be enough to define a career. Leaders today face all four at once.
The leaders I spoke with in Norway are focused on building their resilience muscles to meet this moment. They are finding ways to not only recoverâ€”but recover stronger and thrive as disruptions continue. And they are finding the best solutions in the world for problems that donâ€™t respect borders.
What does this take? One thing is agility, the ability to act and react quickly without stumbling. Another is balance, the notion that youâ€™re managing for near-term performance without losing sight of long-term potential.
Lastly, it takes real courage. The courage to be decisive and move fast amid persistent headwinds. Leaders in Arendal exemplified these qualities. I aspire to do the same. You can learn more about building a resilience agenda here: https://lnkd.in/gnnsaE2P

"I had the chance to moderate an Asia Business Council panel in Bangkok this morning, which looked at findings from our new McKinsey Global Institute report: â€œAsia on the cusp of a new era.â€ You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/g_x6QA_p
Asia is not a monolith. Our research analyzes it across five areas: China, India, Advanced Asia (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea), Emerging Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand), and Frontier Asia (Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka).
Even within these groups, we observed differences. We think this geographic and economic diversity is one of Asiaâ€™s greatest strengths.
During todayâ€™s panel, we focused on the studyâ€™s pan-Asian takeaways, noting that the regionâ€™s economies have thrived as global connections deepened over the past 30 years. Now, Asia is entering a new era that will be defined by five trends:
- Trade: It is the worldâ€™s trade crossroads but could increasingly face trade tensions.
- Technology: The value created by technology is shifting beyond manufacturing, where Asia excels.
- Demographic shifts: Asia has the people to fuel growth, but the effects of aging are fiercest in the higher productivity economies of the Pacific Rim.
- Sustainability: Its net-zero transition is massive. Asia is the worldâ€™s industrial base and has surging energy demands.
- Capitalization: Asiaâ€™s lower capital returns are not sustainable if the cost of capital and balance sheet stresses rise at a time when the region will demand the majority of global capital to continue growing.
Each of these trends will bring challenges and opportunities. Facing them with courage will be key. Leaders bold enough to innovate and make resilient choices have a once-in-career chance to lay a strong foundation for the next era.
The panelists who joined me are clearly ready to seize this opportunity. So are their peers throughout the region. According to a new Asia Business Council survey, for example, 74 percent of regional CEOs say that significant strategic shifts will be needed in multiple domainsâ€”but 83 percent are optimistic about what is to come.
Thatâ€™s the kind of outlook that will help Asiaâ€™s economies navigate this complex moment and continue to thrive.

"A year ago, we set up a group dedicated to helping our clients navigate geopolitical risks. In addition to war in Europe and unfolding competition among states in Asia, business leaders need to monitor a host of long-tail political risks and conflicts across other geographies, including Africa and South Asia.
Even so, I worry that not enough structured, forward-looking conversations about geopolitics are happening among senior management teams and at board level. These conversations are needed to develop â€˜strategic foresightâ€™ â€“ the ability to see around corners and position a company to weather storms and move fast on opportunities.
Working with client's weâ€™ve found that scenario planning can be an effective tool for structuring this dialog. Done well, scenario planning builds insight and senior-team alignment on the outcomes that would have the most material effect on an organization. This in turn enables a move from scanning to planning â€“ creating early-warning systems and active contingency plans covering everything from data and networks to people and partnerships to repatriation of funds and security.

Since that day, the suffering has continued for many of our Israeli employees â€“ most of whom have been directly impacted in some way. Our support for our employees in Israel and their families remains steadfast to this day.
In the month thatâ€™s followed the attacks, the world has witnessed a massive humanitarian crisis in Gaza impacting so many innocent civilians and many women and children. Cisco has been â€“ and remains â€“ committed to supporting humanitarian efforts in the region in any way we can. This is a key part of how we aim to live up to our purpose of powering an inclusive future for all.
While some believe that you cannot support both Israeli and Palestinian communities at the same time, we at Cisco believe you certainly can do both. We support our people, period.
In addition to our over 700 employees in Israel, we have Jewish employees around the world who are experiencing suffering and anxiety and seeing a rise in antisemitism, and condemning the violence against innocent civilians while supporting humanitarian efforts. We also have many Palestinian employees across the globe who have lost many family members and friends in Gaza, and also stand against the attacks of October 7. Many members of these communities are living in fear and uncertainty, and in our conversations with our employees, it is clear to me that we all seek for peace. I have had the chance to spend time with many of our Israeli employees and last week, I met many members of our Palestinian community at Cisco. The stories of pain, grief, anxiety, and fear are unfathomable and heartbreaking, and we want to acknowledge this great suffering in our communities. At Cisco, we will continue to provide a safe place for all of our employees to have uncomfortable and difficult conversations. I also want to be very clear that Cisco condemns discrimination of all types â€“ including antisemitism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia â€“ and we always will. We stand in support with our Jewish, Israeli, Arab, and Palestinian employees, and we thank them for their courage and trust in us. We also honor their stories, their suffering, and we remain committed to helping our employees stay safe while advancing our humanitarian efforts in the region. We will always strive to work towards solutions however we can to find a path forward.",Geopolitics
"Over the past three days, Iâ€™ve had the honor of spending time with many of our Cisco Israel teams to understand what they need most in the face of war, devastation, and loss of life. First and foremost, weâ€™ve been focused on their safety and well-being and that of their families. Weâ€™ve also launched humanitarian efforts to support those most vulnerable in addition to ensuring continuity of critical communications and security services. While we recognize the dynamics of the situation and know itâ€™s far from over, I am so proud of our teams for their strength, quick action, and compassion. My deepest hope is that the situation will come under control soon, and that the rising and heartbreaking violence will cease, so that discussions can commence to bring about a peaceful resolution for everyone. Until then, we will remain steadfast in our commitment to supporting our teams, our customers and partners, and the communities we serve.",Geopolitics

We are in contact with our team on the ground and working to provide support to them, their families, and those employees whoâ€™ve already been called into service. We will continue to watch the situation carefully so that we can best support our teamâ€™s safety and well-being.",Geopolitics

"I've had the chance to reflect on my time in #Davos at the World Economic Forum, and if I had to boil down my biggest takeaway from the summit, it would be 'resilience.'
#WEF was an opportunity for global leaders to discuss the world's most pressing challenges. We proved we CAN tackle complex issues head-on: managing macro-economic uncertainty. Enabling digital transformation. Overcoming supply chain disruptions. Investing in #ESG. There's absolutely more work to be done, but I left full of hope and determination.
We have proven to be resilient. This year is no different.

"Among the numerous conflicting forces creating uncertainty in the current real estate market for investors, the recent downgrade of U.S. credit by Fitch from AAA to AA+ should not be considered one of them, as summarized in a recent article by Barron's. While the poorly executed political process that led to the extension of the debt limit is far from ideal and largely contributed to the downgrade, the likelihood of the U.S. defaulting on its obligations was extremely low, if not close to zero. The Federal Reserve's aggressive quantitative tightening, including the reduction of its balance sheet, is creating a liquidity crunch compounded by the pressure on banks to reduce their exposure to commercial real estate. While these unusual dynamics remain quite challenging for investors, a significant amount of capital is still on the sidelines, awaiting appropriate price adjustments based on property type and market conditions.",Geopolitics

"Iâ€™m just back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where the focus of this yearâ€™s meeting was timely: Cooperation in a Fragmented World. Faced with constrained fiscal space and a world that seems to be spinning apart, what hope is there for collaboration that requires multilateral support? In Davos, leaders explored the geopolitical and economic implications of this trend. But I was disappointed to hear fewer people talk about the implications for global health and climate adaptation. Partnerships like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, saved millions of lives in the first two decades of the 21st century. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed and, in some cases, reversed that hard-won progress. There have been bright spots, including the strong show of support at the Global Fundâ€™s seventh replenishment last October. But this moment demands more. As a foundation, weâ€™re guided by the Sustainable Development Goals. Every country in the United Nations signed onto these targets. Now, governments need to follow through on the commitments they made to their citizens with the political will and resources required. Between the upcoming G7 summit in Japan and the G20 summit in India, there are many opportunities ahead to recommit â€“ not just with words, but action. We canâ€™t lurch from crisis to crisis or wait for another massive global health tragedy to spark action. All of us â€“ philanthropies, governments, civil society, and the private sector â€“ must step up. We must ensure the pipeline of innovation is set up to meet the great needs of this moment, and to deliver the next generation of tools as soon as theyâ€™re ready. The stakes are high. We could end polio, bring malaria to near zero, help farmers adapt to climate change, and massively improve the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions over the next decade. We could be a part of ushering in a more equitable world, or simply a world more prepared for the next potential pandemic. Any way you look at it, the investment is worth the effort.",Geopolitics

"This was one of the best weeks - intense but rewarding as I visited clients and colleagues across Europe. I joined Marsh McLennan (MMC) CEO John Doyle (my boss), and the leaders of all four MMC businesses on a tour of Zurich, Milan, Munich and Paris.
We met with over 30 clients across 15 institutions, and with Oliver Wyman (OW) and MMC colleagues in each city, including a pan-European town hall beamed from Munich in mid-week.
Three main observations from our meetings:
Firstly Iâ€™m a Steven Pinker-following optimist, but nonetheless the challenges facing companies continue to wash ashore with ever-greater frequency. Some call it a permacrisis, or even a polycrisis; but there are many exciting opportunities embedded in this disruption. All week we discussed:
- Boosting resilience in the face of climate change, geopolitical tensions and other risks (a topic across Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman).
- Financing the energy transition (OWâ€™s teams have been doing enormous amounts of work in this space, and we think MMC has an unprecedented range of offerings to support clients).
- Shortening, and gaining greater visibility into, supply chains (where my colleagues Amy Barnes and Jonathan Lee are doing some groundbreaking work to develop new analytics for clients).
- The changing world of work, and the threats and opportunities of generative AI (where Mercer colleagues Martine, Ravin and Kate literally wrote the book).
- As well, of course, as the challenges and opportunities in the local and global insurance markets (thank you to Martin, Dean, Dorothee and Christos, who were my tutors this week) and the investments world.
Secondly that in the face of these challenges and opportunities clients react very well when we carefully bring together the Strategy, Risk and People expertise across our businesses â€“ by carefully I mean well-targeted to solving their problem at the most senior levels of their organisation.
And thirdly that OW is very much on the march. I met with colleagues in all the locations working on multiple large, complex projects with clients. This is where we want to work, supporting our clients through their transformative moments. Whether they are building new client offerings, transforming their revenue and cost performance, working through a deal or responding to a regulator-or investor-mandated change, we want to earn to right to be their Partner. And in Zurich and Munich, the recent Fink study ranked us as a top three strategy consulting firm in multiple sectors.
Critically when the actual client project leaders are asked for their opinion, OW is number one. This is how we want to work, and what we want to be known for â€“ matchless depth of expertise, delivered in a collaborative way that equips our clients for their own transformation.
I feel inspired for the next phase of our work to build the OW and MMC civilizations.

"Friends,
The third week of my Wealth & Poverty class introduces questions that continue to be vigorously debated â€” the effects of globalization and technological change on widening inequality.
Many policymakers regard both globalization and technological change as â€œinevitableâ€ forces that improve economic efficiency â€” and which should not be altered by political decisions. But neither globalization nor the path of technological change is inevitable. Both can (and one might argue should) be managed in ways that improve the wellbeing of most people while protecting the most vulnerable.
The government makes many such decisions, often behind closed doors. Even if the public doesnâ€™t know about them, big money usually does know â€” and influences the outcomes. As a result, many Americans bear the consequences of decisions over globalization and technological change without knowing it.
The questions weâ€™ll be exploring today are: How have globalization and technological change widened inequality? Given their effects, what are the major job categories now and into the future? Why have low-wage â€œpersonal-serviceâ€ jobs replaced higher-paying â€œroutine productionâ€ jobs? Why are high-paying â€œsymbolic analyticâ€ jobs usually limited to college graduates? Why are all jobs becoming less stable? What are the consequences of these trends for politics?
Even though this isnâ€™t a real classroom and Iâ€™m not with you in person, I hope you find this lesson both enjoyable and challenging.",Geopolitics

"Compiled by Vatan HÃ¼zeir, the latest cache of internal documents describing Big Oil's concealed knowledge of global warming is a gold mine.
One bombshell is a confidential Shell scenario report from 1989 which imagined two futures: SUSTAINABLE WORLD and GLOBAL MERCANTILISM.
In SUSTAINABLE WORLD, greenhouse gas emissions would peak around the year 2000 and decline rapidly thereafter, and total CO2 concentrations would be limited to 400 ppm. GLOBAL MERCANTILISM, on the other hand, would see emissions continue to rise (this is the path we're on).
What would the world be like under GLOBAL MERCANTILISM (the path we're on)? According to Shell, ""There would be more violent weather - more storms, more droughts, more deluges. Mean sea level would rise at least 30 cm. Agricultural patterns would be most dramatically changed. Something as simple as a moderate change in rainfall pattern disrupts eco-systems, and many species of trees, plants, animals and insects would not be able to move and adapt.""
""The changes would, however, most impact on humans,"" Shell
went on. ""In earlier times, man was able to respond with his feet. Today, there is no place to go because people already stand there. Perhaps those in industrial countries could cope with a rise in sea level (the Dutch example) but for poor countries such defences are not possible.""
""The potential refugee problem in GLOBAL MERCANTILISM could be unprecedented,"" Shell predicted. ""Africans would push into Europe, Chinese into the Soviet Union, Latins into the United States, Indonesians into Australia. Boundaries would count for little - overwhelmed by the numbers. Conflicts would abound. Civilization could prove a fragile thing. The logic of SUSTAINABLE WORLD is a society choosing to channel some investments into environmental maintenance against this contingency.""
And yet despite these predictions, Shell chose to push the world into the high-carbon scenario it knew would be so disastrous.
The company spent the next decade denying the existence of global warming through disinformation groups like the Global Climate Coalition. And then spent the last two decades giving false reassurances that it's moving away from fossil fuels, all while actually expanding its fossil fuel business and blocking the fossil fuel controls it knows are needed to avoid irreversible global damage.
Other nuggets from Shell's document:
- admits the ""principal source"" of CO2 is ""fossil fuel combustion""
- notes methane a powerful greenhouse gas about 25 times more potent than CO2
- foreshadows the use of offsets to enable more fossil fuel use
This document underscores the fact that Shell and the broader fossil fuel industry had a choice and knowingly chose global disaster in exchange for short term profits.

"Iâ€™m constantly seeking to improve ways for multinationals to assess and address political & systemic risks. ðŸ‘‡
These risks are increasing in their complexity, diversity, frequency, impacts, and velocity with which they appear due to new technologies. Corporations that focus on their long-term sustainability and ethical business practices correctly see them as threats that require constant assessment, preparation, and incorporation into their decisions about its existing and planned operating (and supplier) locations.

"Over the last decade, multiple geopolitical shocks have shifted the global operating environment toward one defined by great power competition, growing nationalism and decreased support for free trade.
In the International Monetary Fund's latest Global Financial Stability Report, staff warn rising gepolitical tensions threaten global financial stability including the cross-border allocation of capital, international payment systems and asset prices.
Their analysis finds that a one-standard-deviation increase in geopolitical tensions between an investing and a recipient country - equivalent to the diverging voting behavior of the US and China in the UN since 2016 - could reduce bilateral cross-border portfolio and bank allocation by 15%.
This latest report underscores the urgency with which policymakers, multinational corporations, civil society and citizens alike must work to reduce tensions and prevent further fragmentation and for companies, specificially, to invest in intellgience gathering, risk mitigation and strategic planning.

"Around seven years ago, I worked on a big project for a company expanding into Myanmar. We had a tortured discussion about whether this company could use the term â€œRohingyaâ€ in its own communications. International human rights NGOs wanted this, but it also seemed to increase the possibility of government retaliation against this firm, and potentially more broadly.
I was reminded of this today, reading this article from Saijel Kishan and team at Bloomberg, on how investors are becoming â€œcoyâ€ about using terms like ESG and climate change. According to the article, these terms are down by half on analyst calls, compared to a year ago.
It is staggering to me how open to extortion of this kind the US corporate sector is. Notably, Brazil is polarized in an almost identical way, but firms there have not been drawn into this kind of rhetorical/campaign finance mire.
The Republican strategy on these issues is also â€œESGâ€ it just uses the criteria as exclusions. In a free market, surely people can do what they want with their money.
Liberals are constantly in my inbox asking why companies donâ€™t stop funding these politicians. The short answer is that this is all a big corrupt racket and so few have the courage to call it and make a more decisive move. So the problems will perpetuate.
It probably is good if we stop using the term ESG and talk instead about material risk, opportunity, and the need for ethical guardrails. So this is the right evolution for the wrong reasons.

"One thing thatâ€™s certain in 2023 is the uncertainty.
Itâ€™s hardly surprising off the back of a 2022, when the Collins Dictionary word of the year was ""permacrisis"".
Geopolitics continues to have a significant impact on business: supply chains, energy costs, investment destinations.
Weâ€™ve worked with The Economist on the five steps CEOs can take to navigate their way through the constant change.

"In two days weâ€™ll be publishing a new report, â€œmapping the new geopolitical divides,â€ showing how the emerging world is increasingly divided between West and East, and the consequences for business.
The full report including profiles for all 61 countries/territories covered is at: https://lnkd.in/g2fjPHxV
Main findings:
â€¢ The Western bloc has lost ground in all world regions. Five years ago, 30 of the 61 countries/territories we analyzed were in the Western bloc. Perhaps most strikingly, five years ago, 13 of these countries were strongly allied with the West. Today, only 6 countries or territories in the WTW Index rate as strong Western allies (including Jordan, Mexico, Qatar and Taiwan). Meanwhile, 7 are rated as leaning strongly East (including Belarus, China, Mali, Myanmar and Russia).
â€¢ The main driver of these losses appears to be â€œdealignmentâ€ â€“ emerging market countries are increasingly seeking advantage by playing the superpowers off against each other. This trend is particularly evident in countries that wish to avoid censure on grounds of human rights or political freedom, such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Cameroon, and Uganda.
â€¢ Foreign investors face substantial risks from these geopolitical trends. In countries that shifted East (from neutrality or a Western alignment) over the past five years, on average, expropriation risks rose by 7% and political rights fell by 10%. In â€œdealigningâ€ countries, each of these risk indicators also worsened, and the dealignment trend is impacting more countries. #politicalrisk #geopolitics",Geopolitics
"We are entering an era of great global turbulence. Leaders of big business now need to go beyond ESG and focus harder and deeper on a set of the most critical societal issues. That's the nub of this commentary I wrote jointly with Ian Davis, former chair and global MD of McKinsey.
A condensed version of the piece was published by The Economist last week. Delighted to have this extended version featured by the LSE's Grantham Institute.
We argue that the response of global businesses to current societal challenges is patchy and inadequate. Whether on climate change, geopolitical divisions, the risks of AI, etc, corporate actions do not match the scale of the problems. This is notwithstanding all those well-meaning ESG initiatives.
We offer three basic recommendations for CEOs of big companies:
1. Build a much deeper understanding of societal challenges, how they might evolve and how they might impact their businesses.
2. Focus more narrowly on the few societal issues which are most critical to the business and drive management of these issues deeper into corporate strategy.
3. Mobilize more powerful coalitions, with governments at the core, to help tackle the issues.
Many of these points have been made by others. If properly implemented together they would have important consequences.
CEOs would concentrate on the highest-impact actions needed on the biggest societal problems their companies face or have helped unleash.
Technology giants would focus much harder on heading off potential AI-related disasters. Big Oil would seek to mobilize the entire industry to curb oil and gas production. CEOs of many global companies would engage more actively with governments to head off geopolitical conflict. And so on.
This level of corporate ambition and focus on such issues has historical precedents. At various points in the past, we argue, large companies have mobilized powerfully behind or alongside governments to tackle big societal challenges.
Comments welcome. All views my own, as always.
Many excellent colleagues have contributed to my thinking on these issues, including at ERM, Critical Resource - an ERM Group Company, and Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change & the Environment. Tim Cooper Sabine Hoefnagel Alaric Marsden.

"âš¡ï¸#Energy and ðŸŒŽ#geopolitics have always been closely linked!
I had the pleasure to speak at the EY #Energy summit in #Rome about the impact of current #geopolitical trends on the #energytransition
Some of the points I made about the future geopolitical environment:
1. Based on my team's #scenario analysis on the #future of #globalisation we are moving towards a world in which the nature of geopolitical relations will matter much more (for details here: https://lnkd.in/gRHqH7_x)
2. There is a #paradigm #shift away from economic rationality and cost efficiency towards geopolitical and national security considerations: Geopolitics will determine #energy #security and hence shape energy markets. This will impact both fossil fuel and renewable energy supply chains.
3. While the war in Ukraine has posed an #energy #trilemma which saw a short-term emphasis on security of supply and affordability, in the medium-term #sustainability will remain a central goal. Also because in the long-term the energy transition will allow Europe to reduce its dependencies.
And these will be some of the many #implications:
1. Energy, energy #infrastructure and the #technologies linked to the transition will be at the center of #geostrategic #competition. They will therefore become a #tool and a #target of geopolitics.
2. There will be more #state #interventionism and industrial policy to secure national/European interests. This creates risks and opportunities and means #volatility and unpredictability.
3. Expect a #patchwork of #regulations and incentives within the #EU and globally. This will create a more complex operating environment.
4. On top of the ""old"" #dependencies (fossil fuels), new ones will emerge from the #renewable energy #supplychains which are more diffuse and complex.
Some of these trends can be found in other #sectors too: https://lnkd.in/eNFuuEtW

"Great to see this important piece in Harvard Business Review from Robert Eccles and Alison Taylor. In it they make the case that Corporate Sustainability Officers are increasingly becoming Corporate Diplomats (see https://lnkd.in/dJHNteHt) or geostrategists (see https://lnkd.in/ekpGhS_K, https://lnkd.in/dyubwMqd, https://lnkd.in/eNkg55pF, https://lnkd.in/e-yq_gXf and https://lnkd.in/eduj-scy). They also lay out five steps any CSO (or public affairs or general counsel or other C-suite leader) can take to become a corporate diplomat or geostrategist: elevate their role so as to ""involve them in strategy and capital allocation"", enhance coordination with governance, risk, ethics and compliance, create greater integration with boards, engage them more fully with investors, and support them with adequate resources and expertise."" #WhartonESG #corporatediplomacy #cso #geostrategy #politicalrisk #sustainability #ethics",Geopolitics
"Great inaugural session at the ESG Aspen Summit organized by the Aspen Institute Business & Society Program about #EvolutionofESG

These are some of my key takeaways:
âœ… Relevant changes in the last yearâ€¦. we are entering in a new phase for ESG.
The Summit is a perfect time to have conversations about this evolution
âœ… About the ESG debate: if corporations consider ESG as a business issue, then it is a business issue. If business leads, politicians will follow
âœ… Bipartisanship is more important than ever. We need to find practical solutions to the challenges facing all Americans
âœ… Optimistic message: all stakeholders are taking seriously ESG issues
âœ… Companies will be more accountable about their positions and relationship with the trade associations
âœ… ESG is about economic growth, value, business opportunity. We have to insist on this message. Taking out ESG words from our messages is not the solution
âœ… We have been working since 20 years ago. From CSR to ESG.... but we are doing the same work beyond the acronyms: delivering our purpose

Important new work from #WhartonESG in collaboration with Brian Ganson Stellenbosch Business School PRIO Anne Jamison Copenhagen Business School.

"Can changes in the tone of local media articles predict where #conflict will break out? In this new white paper, Anne Jamison, Kristian Hoelscher, Brian Ganson, Witold Henisz and I take a first step to building that link. We draw on #GDELTâ€™s global database of more than five billion media articles to test the relationship between media-reported sentiment and conflict events.
We find that a worsening in media sentiment is significantly associated with future conflict events as measured by the #ACLED, #SCAD and #UCDP-GED conflict datasets. We find that this is true one day before, three days before, seven days before, fourteen days before, and thirty days before conflict, but the effect size is larger where temporal proximity is closer. Moreover, as media sentiment becomes more positive, we see fewer future conflicts.
We propose that media #sentiment analysis can help us analyze conflict escalation processes more precisely. While our findings may be a bit intuitive, they provide new empirical evidence for #peace and #conflict research where previously we relied on anecdotes, represent an advance in understandings of the media-conflict relationship, and can help generate more accurate early warning conflict tools for policymakers, local populations, and other stakeholders.

"We recently hosted ~170 of our family office clients and friends of the firm from 15 different countries at our annual Apex Global Family Office Symposium in New York City. The day opened up with Sara Naison-Tarajano, global head of Goldman Sachs Apex, who kicked off an impressive line-up of speakers who discussed a range of timely topics, including the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape, opportunities in venture and growth, what it takes to build a multigenerational family office, and more. Here are a few insights from the sessions:
 
• Michael Rubin, chief executive officer of Fanatics, discussed how constant innovation in business is critical to success. His thought process on ensuring that Fanatics had longevity was simple: “If we're just selling what other people are selling, we have no chance of existing long term. We needed to provide a differentiated experience.”

• John Paul DeJoria, co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, and co-founder and chairman emeritus of The Patron Spirits Company, shared his secret to making the most of his time: “Pay attention to the vital few. Ignore the trivial many.” 

• Patrick McCurry, partner at McDermott Will & Emery LLP, Eric Naison-Phillips, managing principal of Winged Keel Group, and Cliff Schlesinger, senior wealth strategist for Goldman Sachs Family Office, shared insights on the key considerations in building and sustaining a multi-generational family office. Naison-Phillips discussed how in later generations, there is a critical realization that the responsibility of strong stewardship is on your shoulders. “You have to ingrain that generation to generation, and it has to be a consistent message,” he said.

"An interesting thing happening with fiat-backed stablecoins. They benefit from the deeply underserved demand for USD as a reserve currency and are creeping into the top 10 holders of US Treasurys

Some potential implications:

1. Non-US consumers worldwide are a large holder of US Treasurys (or stated differently, the US Govt is increasingly borrowing directly from non-US consumer s)
2. Defi makes it easier for a non-US citizen to buy stables than for a US citizen to buy USTs

3. Our model for financial contagion in a crisis is already outdated; instability in money markets and stables probably will interact with each other in unpredictable ways 

4. The decoupling of US-China probably won't play out as linearly as we think it will

5. Tools for capital controls probably need to adapt in order for governments around the world to manage the fact that money that used to sit in locally denominated savings accounts now essentially sit in USD",Geopolitics

We need an active construction program in the US building proven designs.
