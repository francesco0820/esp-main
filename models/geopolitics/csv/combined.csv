"""Accelerated approval should be an established pathway in rare disease but the truth is only a handful of non-oncology rare diseases have been approved via accelerated approval. It's time to push for an Orphan Drug Act 2.0 to put precision medicine to work for ultra-rare diseases."" - Emil Kakkis, MD, PhD, CEO of Ultragenyx, speaking at the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus briefing during #RareDiseaseWeek.

"Llama 2 has massively shifted the GenAI ecosystem, but is it as good as ChatGPT? Yes! For factual summarization both Llama 2 70B and GPT-4 are close to human performance, and Llama 2 70b is 30x cheaper. This is based on a carefully curated human dataset of factual summarization with 373 examples, each with a correct and incorrect summary we ask the models to rank.
Along the way, we take a few really interesting detours that provide their own valuable insights. Firstly, Llama 2's tokenization is ~20% larger than ChatGPTs, so this needs to be taken into account for costs. Secondly, the Llama 2 models are not as good at following instructions as the ChatGPT models, and require additional post-processing (and insist on giving explanations that you have to pay for as generated tokens). Thirdly, when using LLMs for evaluation of two options, be very careful about ordering bias "" most LLMs will have a strong preference for either the first or second option.

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for ""Bidenomics"". Unemployment hasn't been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Biden's team seems to have engineered the rare ""soft landing"" where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" "" the world's most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. America's greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Biden's leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on America's constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administration's policies. President Biden's appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook

"Let's set a rule for companies that talk about the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions that they serve.

It is one thing for people to have access to a benefit or a service.

It is another thing for them to be actually *using* it.

Too many distracting companies and services and benefits that are underutilized.

Sometimes this underutilization is *by design* and made difficult for people to access.

We are caught up celebrating the wrong things.

Lives truly impacted is not the same thing as *users.*",

"Having played soccer for the greatest university in the world - aka Georgetown University - and been a lifelong fan of the US Women's National Team, I'm a firm believer that leaders can take many important lessons and experiences from the soccer field (and any sports field/court/arena for that matter). That's why I couldn't have been more energized to sit down with my friend and U.S. Soccer Federation President Cindy Parlow Cone recently to talk about her unexpected career journey, how she leads with humility to make decisions, what her process is for building a team, as well as how her teams are expanding access, advancing inclusion, and fostering belonging across the sport. as12 This clip is one of my favorite topics we discussed: the ""scoreboard"" to measure leadership success. For some, success is as simple as the performance of the most visible part of a team or organization "" that might mean in Cindy's case: national soccer team victories, or me at Deloitte Consulting: our consulting business's growth rate. But success needs to be measured much more broadly; it's about culture, it's about broader societal impact, it's about things you can measure and things you can't. Hear how Cindy measures success across US Soccer's many priorities and encourages people around her to think about success wholistically. How do you define success and what are some ways you track it? #Deloitte #USWNT #Leadership #Success",

"A few weeks ago, I saw Taylor Swift perform, and I was blown away.
I am not a huge fan; I like her music on the radio, but I've never bought or downloaded an album. I only know the songs on the radio. But I must say, it was the most inspiring performance I've ever seen. And not just because she's a great entertainer "" there is no doubt that she is "" but because I walked away feeling empowered to go after my dreams.
Why?
Her storytelling and unapologetically authentic love for what she does made me want to be better at what I do. I will be 45 years old this year; I am a reasonably self-confident person. And I walked away feeling empowered. Like I could do anything I put my mind to. And I wanted to go for it!
Now I get why she's loved. She makes people believe in themselves.
And that's what I want to do, too.

Me: To begin, then, how did we get here? Which is to say, what are the winds behind the sails of the uber wealthy's super yachts? How have the very wealthy and corporations hijacked our economy? Why has it gotten so much more extreme in the wake of the pandemic?
Nabil Ahmed: The starting point is recognizing that we arrived here not by accident but by economic and political choices that were made by our governments that widened the great divide of economic inequality.
These were already in full swing prior to the pandemic. For decades we've seen structural policy shifts that have increased inequality""from a surge in monopoly power to the erosion of workers' rights and labor market liberalization to the privatization of public goods like health and education to the erosion of tax rates on the richest people and corporations.
Since 1995, for example, the top one percent has grabbed nearly 20 times more wealth than humanity's bottom 50 percent This era has grown the wealth and the power of those at the very top and not so much left but actually pushed so many behind "" and in doing so, made us all less safe, and less resilient to massive shocks.",

"The peak of Covid became a two-front war"" the virus itself and misinformation. Dr. Nidhi Nikhanj, a great friend of mine and the cornerstone of my good old days of residency at The George Washington University Hospital, sat at the forefront of it, in the clinic.
In chapter two of ""Dead Wrong: Diagnosing and Treating Healthcare's Misinformation Illness"", Nidhi led me to examine Covid-19 in a way that ultimately showed me how high-stakes this misinformation illness and its compounding effects had become, pandemic or not.
Misinformation thrives on desperation and our modern society provides the perfect place for it to thrive. In healthcare's fight against misinformation, doing nothing means losing everything. But doing no harm means doing everything we can, right now.

"I will never forget when I told my boss that I needed help. It was 2006 and I was a mess. I was miserable in life and at work. We both knew I was failing, but I was too scared to admit it. Until one fateful day when my life came crashing down, and I finally mustered the courage to admit that I wasn't going to succeed and that I needed to make a change.
And he did what a great boss should. He listened. He helped me transition out of the company so I could move back to Colorado. He never shamed me. He never belittled me. He just offered a bit of help.
In last week's episode of Reflect Foward: Advice From a CEO, I share my advice on how to best help an employee who opens up about mental health challenges.
Why? Because these are important conversations. And they are going to happen more and more. Leaders can't avoid them; rather, they need to lean in and lend a helping hand. It's amazing what a bit of help can do.

At Pfizer, we are committed to protecting and saving lives, and dedicated to the health and well-being of people around the world.

"Today, February 24, 2023, marks a somber milestone. Russian forces invaded Ukraine on this day one year ago, triggering a humanitarian crisis that has created ripples of fear, despair and devastation worldwide. We've lost many innocent people, and we've watched global geopolitical tension escalate.
When the international community made the decision to implement unprecedented sanctions against Russia, most sanctions and export control restrictions contained exclusions for the provision of medicine. In addition, Pfizer recognized that halting the delivery of medicine, including cancer or cardiovascular therapies, to Russia would cause significant patient suffering and potential loss of life. Ending Pfizer operations in Russia would run counter to our guiding principle of putting patients first.
Yet business in Russia could not then, and cannot now, continue as usual. Last year, on March 14, we announced that Pfizer would donate the equivalent of all profits from our sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Since announcing that commitment, we have committed more than $30 million to 15 unique organizations, each of which provides on-the-ground humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine.
As the war continues, the global community has a responsibility to ensure support to Ukraine continues unabated. We remain hopeful that a peaceful outcome is possible. Our support remains steadfast and consistent with Pfizer's core values, particularly those of courage, excellence and equity.

One of the key lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic was that we must have policies, partnerships and infrastructure in place to help ensure equitable access to medicines and vaccines. The biopharmaceutical industry is focused on finding solutions for the world's most devastating diseases""but there is a huge gap separating those who can access these innovations and those who cannot. The IFPMA's Berlin Declaration is one way we're working to help ensure that authorized vaccines and treatments for future pandemics are available and affordable to all countries.

"Letter to Harvard University President Gay:
Dear President Gay:
I am an alumnus of Harvard College 1992, Government. My tutor and thesis advisor was Dame Louise Richardson, who I am sure you know went on to be the head of Oxford and whose academic scholarship is on terrorism. I am also an Israeli citizen and reside in Israel for the past 20 years. This week, my best friends lost their son fighting Hamas terrorists, another colleague lost his elderly parent to Hamas butchery and friends have a son who attended the rave party, was severely wounded and is held in Gaza by Hamas. There were 13 funerals in my relatively small city Ra'anana this week alone.
I am deeply troubled by what is missing in your statements around these terrorist events. You condemn the Hamas barbarism, but you speak mostly about listening to each other in the Harvard community. While that is important, now is a time for you as the leader of Harvard to speak much more clearly and forcefully against terror. Harvard does not only exist to foster dialogue among its students. Harvard's alumni and students, certainly of the Government department and the Law, Business and Kennedy Schools, are and will be leaders of governments, corporations, international organizations, etc. Harvard's mission is to create actors, not only talkers, on the world stage as a force for good.
In order to do this, as Harvard's leader you must speak more forcefully and unequivocally. Not just to condemn the barbarism. Your message should be clear and unequivocal, not just to support Israeli victims, but to SAVE GAZA AND THE PALESTINIANS FROM HAMAS! Hamas's horrific crimes against Israelis this week and over the years are secondary only to their horrific crimes against their own people since their founding. They have singlehandedly (alongside Islamic Jihad) and too effectively prolonged the Palestinian Israeli conflict, wreaked death and destruction among their people all while profiting "" be it in capital for their leadership or murderous suicide missions for their nihilistic ideology. They threaten to drag the world into a global conflict. This is all historical truth, not perspective. Harvard must stand for truth.
Palestinians who say that Hamas represent them have made a clear choice "" they choose and support terrorism - that Harvard must reject. You can make a difference if you are clearer about the University's position. This is a time for moral clarity to prevail. Harvard is a bastion of education. Harvard leadership should be screaming from the top of its lungs "" end the education of hate and antisemitism that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have perpetrated to Palestinian children for decades. Hamas has brought ruin to the Palestinian cause, to the cause of peace and co-existence. That message must be clear to the entire educated world, and you should lead it. Please consult Dame Richardson and her 2006 book What Terrorists Want. There is much to learn from her.

"Fascinating read in the The New York Times on the challenges AI start-ups face in a world where 'hyperscalers' like Google, Microsoft and Amazon control the computing power necessary to develop groundbreaking tech. #AI #StartUps
AI start-ups today need substantial resources to succeed. Companies like Cohere are turning back to their roots at tech giants, buying the necessary computing power to create their own technology. It's like the plot of Game of Thrones, according to David Katz from Radical Ventures, with the tech giants deciding who gets the computing power and who doesn't. #Innovation #TechGiants
In an interesting twist, it's open source software that may even the playing field. The recent decision by Meta to open source its large language model is a game changer, enabling anyone to build on it and compete. In the words of Amr Awadallah, ""Having the collective minds of every researcher on Earth would beat any company."" #OpenSource #FutureOfAI
While Australia's defense innovation ecosystem is burgeoning, it's crucial to consider these international dynamics:
- How can we foster an environment that promotes not just local start-ups, but also the development of advanced tech like AI?
- How can we ensure access to the necessary resources, like computing power, isn't a roadblock for Australian innovators?
- How can we leverage open-source tech to our advantage?

Drawing on the work of my B4Ukraine coalition colleagues--and my own experience in the business, human rights and conflict arena-- I will address how Putin's invasion of Ukraine can and should sharpen the responsibility of multinational corporations to support human rights and the rules-based international order. The substantial exit of foreign companies from Russia remains incomplete, even as companies still operating there are becoming complicit in the war amidst such carnage and impunity in Ukraine.
Business shares responsibility to work for peace-- and governments and civil society share responsibility to make business accountable.
This conflict should reinforce the conviction that we all have the moral, political and economic agency to work for peace and human rights. This conference will remind us.",Geopolitics

"I joined the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) Monday morning for a discussion on global competitiveness and innovation at the 21st International Advisory Council Meeting. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong led a great session, and the conversation reinforced a notion I've written a lot about: The need for strong global linkages in a world that's dividing.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have found that every region relies on imports for more than 25 percent of at least one good. Strengthening and reimagining these linkages, even amid disruption, could accelerate growth and resilience. You can read more here: https://lnkd.in/gDhu6rVG

Last night in Dubai, Word Trade Organization Director-General Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala also offered a practical framework in her opening remarks at our COP28 CEO dinner and panel discussion. She shared five trade-related areas in which private-sector leaders can immediately work to drive climate action, economic growth, and inclusive development. A quick summary:
- Carbon pricing: A more harmonized global approach to carbon pricing and carbon markets could minimize associated trade tensions. - Supply-chain resilience: The private sector can help ensure that supply chain resilience and diversification go hand-in-hand with the green transition.
- Trade-policy reform: Private-sector leaders have a unique opportunity to use their influence to drive policy shifts toward accelerating the transition. - Standards: Private-sector cooperation on climate-related standards, particularly to drive decarbonization in hard-to-abate industries, is an essential ingredient in accelerating the transition. - Innovation: Voluntary licensing and other means could maximize technology diffusion and absorption, improving innovation access, uptake, and the speed of adoption globally.
I had three takeaways from the session. First, measurement and speed are essential in all this. Relying on end-date goals will not get us where we need to be. Let's instead set near-term goals, and hold ourselves accountable for keeping pace with them along the way. Second, we must continue to find ways to collaborate. No organization or entity alone can solve this challenge. Finally, we must embrace "" and' thinking.

"Almost a year ago, I gave a speech in Singapore about a McKinsey Global Institute study on global trade flows. I said that the most complex problems require collaboration. They also require deep understanding. This is even more critical now than it was a year ago.
Today, my colleagues have launched a new interactive tool based on that study to help leaders understand how global economic connections are constantly shifting. It's called the Global Trade Explorer, and you can use it here: https://lnkd.in/gi-SQD67
The tool draws on two decades-worth of data covering more than 50 economies, 15 major sectors, and more than 100 subsectors across various manufactured goods and resources categories. Its insights can help inform decision-making around growth opportunities, supply chain dynamics, and other trends that depend on global trade flows.

"I start today in Davos for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
Why come to Davos? Because sustainable and inclusive growth won't be realized without collaboration across business, government, and civil society. WEF's annual meeting is one of the few venues at which this type of common purpose can be forged.
The topics on which I will be focusing:
Resilience
Last year we worked with WEF to create the Resilience Consortium, the first serious program aimed at developing a deep understanding of what it takes to create organizations and societies that thrive in the face of external shocks. Today we launched the consortium's second major publication (https://lnkd.in/gunPvi9B).
From a business perspective, we know that resilient companies outperform. The bigger picture is that societies underpinned by resilient institutions are more likely to meet the aspirations of their citizens.
Reimagining globalization
We have a generational opportunity to reimagine globalization to create a system that delivers for everyone, especially the most vulnerable. This will happen only if trading relationships and supply chains are reconfigured in ways that preserve the benefits of international trade. Retreat into isolated national or regional blocs is not the answer.
The McKinsey Global Institute has developed a strong fact base to inform these decisions, including a new installment published last week (https://lnkd.in/gjiwj7Mi).
Sustainability
The world is at a pivotal moment on climate, with business leaders and policymakers tempted prioritize energy security and affordability, even if it means retreating from net-zero goals. While accepting that there are tensions, in my view there is no long-term trade-off between energy security, affordability, and sustainability. Bold action now will enable us to navigate the net-zero transition and also accelerate sustainable growth in future.
Inclusion
Most executives now accept that inclusion can be a competitive advantage. Yet progress towards parity on gender and other dimensions of diversity remains slow even for organizations with major diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The truth is that leaders need greater clarity on what works and what does not.
Our new joint report with WEF (https://lnkd.in/gERz-Dx3) will help by surfacing success factors common across DEI initiatives that have driven significant real-world impact.
Space
Space is emerging as an opportunity in sectors ranging from agriculture to drug development to advanced manufacturing. It is also increasingly important as a source of data to help manage society-wide issues including climate change and food security. Now is the time for collaboration to establish a robust governance framework covering topics such as data sharing, safe operations, and property rights.
#WEF23 #McKinseyAtDavos",Geopolitics
"When I think about what 2023 may hold, I'm struck by how much has changed since this time last year.
Geopolitical tensions have boiled over into Russia's senseless war against Ukraine, while US-China relations have grown increasingly tense. Inflation triggered energy and food security issues, and volatility in global markets. Supply chain issues linger, and now the world watches with a mix of relief and concern as China pivots off its zero-COVID strategy.
Against this background, I won't make predictions for the year ahead except to say that it is likely to be turbulent. Here some thoughts on the kind of leadership that may be required.
1. Balance defensive and offensive priorities. Yes, this is a moment to prioritize efficient and effective use of resources. But it is also a time to look for long-term potential. Make bold moves; build new businesses; use new and better technology to differentiate from competitors; stay the course on the transition to net zero; rethink the future of the workplace for a hybrid world.
Our data shows that leaders who play both offense and defense in troubled times outperform all rivals. (https://lnkd.in/gZYFG3cd)
2. Reimagine globalization. The world's toughest challenges - climate, health, security, innovation "" won't be solved by countries or even regions in isolation. We are far more interconnected than most people realize, and dismantling globalization would be far more costly than most have imagined. (https://lnkd.in/gDhu6rVG)
Our opportunity is to recognize the faults of globalization as it exists today while finding new avenues to come together across trade, standards, talent, and capital flows. By doing so we can improve access for all, especially the most vulnerable. For business leaders the immediate opportunity is to reimagine the global footprint of their organizations, as opposed to shrinking back to home markets.
3. Lean into the 'and' in sustainable and inclusive growth. I believe sustainability, inclusion, and growth can, and must, reinforce each other - creating a virtuous cycle in which growth provides the resources needed to contain climate change, promote natural capital and biodiversity, empower households, and promote equitable opportunity. (https://lnkd.in/gB_Tuy_D)
Driving sustainable and inclusive growth is far from easy. There are real tensions that need to be addressed. For business leaders the challenge is to take a long-term view on capital, invest in upskilling at scale AND meet climate goals as the energy transition continues. This demands courage, collaboration, and speed.
More on these themes in the weeks and months ahead.",Geopolitics
"This week I returned to Norway for Arendalsuka, or Arendal Week, the annual gathering in Norway dedicated to political empowerment, democracy, and openness.
This was my second time at the event, and I left feeling even more inspired than last year. Why? In three words: resilience, collaboration, and courage.
Geopolitics, climate change, shifting demographics, tech innovation. Navigating any one of these would be enough to define a career. Leaders today face all four at once.
The leaders I spoke with in Norway are focused on building their resilience muscles to meet this moment. They are finding ways to not only recover""but recover stronger and thrive as disruptions continue. And they are finding the best solutions in the world for problems that don't respect borders.
What does this take? One thing is agility, the ability to act and react quickly without stumbling. Another is balance, the notion that you're managing for near-term performance without losing sight of long-term potential.
Lastly, it takes real courage. The courage to be decisive and move fast amid persistent headwinds. Leaders in Arendal exemplified these qualities. I aspire to do the same. You can learn more about building a resilience agenda here: https://lnkd.in/gnnsaE2P

"I had the chance to moderate an Asia Business Council panel in Bangkok this morning, which looked at findings from our new McKinsey Global Institute report: ""Asia on the cusp of a new era."" You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/g_x6QA_p
Asia is not a monolith. Our research analyzes it across five areas: China, India, Advanced Asia (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea), Emerging Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand), and Frontier Asia (Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka).
Even within these groups, we observed differences. We think this geographic and economic diversity is one of Asia's greatest strengths.
During today's panel, we focused on the study's pan-Asian takeaways, noting that the region's economies have thrived as global connections deepened over the past 30 years. Now, Asia is entering a new era that will be defined by five trends:
- Trade: It is the world's trade crossroads but could increasingly face trade tensions.
- Technology: The value created by technology is shifting beyond manufacturing, where Asia excels.
- Demographic shifts: Asia has the people to fuel growth, but the effects of aging are fiercest in the higher productivity economies of the Pacific Rim.
- Sustainability: Its net-zero transition is massive. Asia is the world's industrial base and has surging energy demands.
- Capitalization: Asia's lower capital returns are not sustainable if the cost of capital and balance sheet stresses rise at a time when the region will demand the majority of global capital to continue growing.
Each of these trends will bring challenges and opportunities. Facing them with courage will be key. Leaders bold enough to innovate and make resilient choices have a once-in-career chance to lay a strong foundation for the next era.
The panelists who joined me are clearly ready to seize this opportunity. So are their peers throughout the region. According to a new Asia Business Council survey, for example, 74 percent of regional CEOs say that significant strategic shifts will be needed in multiple domains""but 83 percent are optimistic about what is to come.
That's the kind of outlook that will help Asia's economies navigate this complex moment and continue to thrive.

"Among the numerous conflicting forces creating uncertainty in the current real estate market for investors, the recent downgrade of U.S. credit by Fitch from AAA to AA+ should not be considered one of them, as summarized in a recent article by Barron's. While the poorly executed political process that led to the extension of the debt limit is far from ideal and largely contributed to the downgrade, the likelihood of the U.S. defaulting on its obligations was extremely low, if not close to zero. The Federal Reserve's aggressive quantitative tightening, including the reduction of its balance sheet, is creating a liquidity crunch compounded by the pressure on banks to reduce their exposure to commercial real estate.

"I'm just back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where the focus of this year's meeting was timely: Cooperation in a Fragmented World. Faced with constrained fiscal space and a world that seems to be spinning apart, what hope is there for collaboration that requires multilateral support? In Davos, leaders explored the geopolitical and economic implications of this trend. But I was disappointed to hear fewer people talk about the implications for global health and climate adaptation. Partnerships like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, saved millions of lives in the first two decades of the 21st century. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed and, in some cases, reversed that hard-won progress. There have been bright spots, including the strong show of support at the Global Fund's seventh replenishment last October. But this moment demands more. As a foundation, we're guided by the Sustainable Development Goals. Every country in the United Nations signed onto these targets. Now, governments need to follow through on the commitments they made to their citizens with the political will and resources required. Between the upcoming G7 summit in Japan and the G20 summit in India, there are many opportunities ahead to recommit "" not just with words, but action. We can't lurch from crisis to crisis or wait for another massive global health tragedy to spark action. All of us "" philanthropies, governments, civil society, and the private sector "" must step up. We must ensure the pipeline of innovation is set up to meet the great needs of this moment, and to deliver the next generation of tools as soon as they're ready. The stakes are high. We could end polio, bring malaria to near zero, help farmers adapt to climate change, and massively improve the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions over the next decade. We could be a part of ushering in a more equitable world, or simply a world more prepared for the next potential pandemic. Any way you look at it, the investment is worth the effort.",Geopolitics

"This was one of the best weeks - intense but rewarding as I visited clients and colleagues across Europe. I joined Marsh McLennan (MMC) CEO John Doyle (my boss), and the leaders of all four MMC businesses on a tour of Zurich, Milan, Munich and Paris.
We met with over 30 clients across 15 institutions, and with Oliver Wyman (OW) and MMC colleagues in each city, including a pan-European town hall beamed from Munich in mid-week.
Three main observations from our meetings:
Firstly I'm a Steven Pinker-following optimist, but nonetheless the challenges facing companies continue to wash ashore with ever-greater frequency. Some call it a permacrisis, or even a polycrisis; but there are many exciting opportunities embedded in this disruption. All week we discussed:
- Boosting resilience in the face of climate change, geopolitical tensions and other risks (a topic across Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman).
- Financing the energy transition (OW's teams have been doing enormous amounts of work in this space, and we think MMC has an unprecedented range of offerings to support clients).
- Shortening, and gaining greater visibility into, supply chains (where my colleagues Amy Barnes and Jonathan Lee are doing some groundbreaking work to develop new analytics for clients).
- The changing world of work, and the threats and opportunities of generative AI (where Mercer colleagues Martine, Ravin and Kate literally wrote the book).
- As well, of course, as the challenges and opportunities in the local and global insurance markets (thank you to Martin, Dean, Dorothee and Christos, who were my tutors this week) and the investments world.
Secondly that in the face of these challenges and opportunities clients react very well when we carefully bring together the Strategy, Risk and People expertise across our businesses "" by carefully I mean well-targeted to solving their problem at the most senior levels of their organisation.
And thirdly that OW is very much on the march. I met with colleagues in all the locations working on multiple large, complex projects with clients. This is where we want to work, supporting our clients through their transformative moments. Whether they are building new client offerings, transforming their revenue and cost performance, working through a deal or responding to a regulator-or investor-mandated change, we want to earn to right to be their Partner. And in Zurich and Munich, the recent Fink study ranked us as a top three strategy consulting firm in multiple sectors.
Critically when the actual client project leaders are asked for their opinion, OW is number one. This is how we want to work, and what we want to be known for "" matchless depth of expertise, delivered in a collaborative way that equips our clients for their own transformation.
I feel inspired for the next phase of our work to build the OW and MMC civilizations.

"Friends,
The third week of my Wealth & Poverty class introduces questions that continue to be vigorously debated "" the effects of globalization and technological change on widening inequality.
Many policymakers regard both globalization and technological change as ""inevitable"" forces that improve economic efficiency "" and which should not be altered by political decisions. But neither globalization nor the path of technological change is inevitable. Both can (and one might argue should) be managed in ways that improve the wellbeing of most people while protecting the most vulnerable.
The government makes many such decisions, often behind closed doors. Even if the public doesn't know about them, big money usually does know "" and influences the outcomes. As a result, many Americans bear the consequences of decisions over globalization and technological change without knowing it.
The questions we'll be exploring today are: How have globalization and technological change widened inequality? Given their effects, what are the major job categories now and into the future? Why have low-wage ""personal-service"" jobs replaced higher-paying ""routine production"" jobs? Why are high-paying ""symbolic analytic"" jobs usually limited to college graduates? Why are all jobs becoming less stable? What are the consequences of these trends for politics?
Even though this isn't a real classroom and I'm not with you in person, I hope you find this lesson both enjoyable and challenging.",Geopolitics

"Compiled by Vatan HA14zeir, the latest cache of internal documents describing Big Oil's concealed knowledge of global warming is a gold mine.
One bombshell is a confidential Shell scenario report from 1989 which imagined two futures: SUSTAINABLE WORLD and GLOBAL MERCANTILISM.
In SUSTAINABLE WORLD, greenhouse gas emissions would peak around the year 2000 and decline rapidly thereafter, and total CO2 concentrations would be limited to 400 ppm. GLOBAL MERCANTILISM, on the other hand, would see emissions continue to rise (this is the path we're on).
What would the world be like under GLOBAL MERCANTILISM (the path we're on)? According to Shell, ""There would be more violent weather - more storms, more droughts, more deluges. Mean sea level would rise at least 30 cm. Agricultural patterns would be most dramatically changed. Something as simple as a moderate change in rainfall pattern disrupts eco-systems, and many species of trees, plants, animals and insects would not be able to move and adapt.""
""The changes would, however, most impact on humans,"" Shell
went on. ""In earlier times, man was able to respond with his feet. Today, there is no place to go because people already stand there. Perhaps those in industrial countries could cope with a rise in sea level (the Dutch example) but for poor countries such defences are not possible.""
""The potential refugee problem in GLOBAL MERCANTILISM could be unprecedented,"" Shell predicted. ""Africans would push into Europe, Chinese into the Soviet Union, Latins into the United States, Indonesians into Australia. Boundaries would count for little - overwhelmed by the numbers. Conflicts would abound. Civilization could prove a fragile thing. The logic of SUSTAINABLE WORLD is a society choosing to channel some investments into environmental maintenance against this contingency.""
And yet despite these predictions, Shell chose to push the world into the high-carbon scenario it knew would be so disastrous.
The company spent the next decade denying the existence of global warming through disinformation groups like the Global Climate Coalition. And then spent the last two decades giving false reassurances that it's moving away from fossil fuels, all while actually expanding its fossil fuel business and blocking the fossil fuel controls it knows are needed to avoid irreversible global damage.
Other nuggets from Shell's document:
- admits the ""principal source"" of CO2 is ""fossil fuel combustion""
- notes methane a powerful greenhouse gas about 25 times more potent than CO2
- foreshadows the use of offsets to enable more fossil fuel use
This document underscores the fact that Shell and the broader fossil fuel industry had a choice and knowingly chose global disaster in exchange for short term profits.

"Over the last decade, multiple geopolitical shocks have shifted the global operating environment toward one defined by great power competition, growing nationalism and decreased support for free trade.
In the International Monetary Fund's latest Global Financial Stability Report, staff warn rising gepolitical tensions threaten global financial stability including the cross-border allocation of capital, international payment systems and asset prices.
Their analysis finds that a one-standard-deviation increase in geopolitical tensions between an investing and a recipient country - equivalent to the diverging voting behavior of the US and China in the UN since 2016 - could reduce bilateral cross-border portfolio and bank allocation by 15%.
This latest report underscores the urgency with which policymakers, multinational corporations, civil society and citizens alike must work to reduce tensions and prevent further fragmentation and for companies, specificially, to invest in intellgience gathering, risk mitigation and strategic planning.

"Around seven years ago, I worked on a big project for a company expanding into Myanmar. We had a tortured discussion about whether this company could use the term ""Rohingya"" in its own communications. International human rights NGOs wanted this, but it also seemed to increase the possibility of government retaliation against this firm, and potentially more broadly.
I was reminded of this today, reading this article from Saijel Kishan and team at Bloomberg, on how investors are becoming ""coy"" about using terms like ESG and climate change. According to the article, these terms are down by half on analyst calls, compared to a year ago.
It is staggering to me how open to extortion of this kind the US corporate sector is. Notably, Brazil is polarized in an almost identical way, but firms there have not been drawn into this kind of rhetorical/campaign finance mire.
The Republican strategy on these issues is also ""ESG"" it just uses the criteria as exclusions. In a free market, surely people can do what they want with their money.
Liberals are constantly in my inbox asking why companies don't stop funding these politicians. The short answer is that this is all a big corrupt racket and so few have the courage to call it and make a more decisive move. So the problems will perpetuate.
It probably is good if we stop using the term ESG and talk instead about material risk, opportunity, and the need for ethical guardrails. So this is the right evolution for the wrong reasons.

"In two days we'll be publishing a new report, ""mapping the new geopolitical divides,"" showing how the emerging world is increasingly divided between West and East, and the consequences for business.
The full report including profiles for all 61 countries/territories covered is at: https://lnkd.in/g2fjPHxV
Main findings:
"" The Western bloc has lost ground in all world regions. Five years ago, 30 of the 61 countries/territories we analyzed were in the Western bloc. Perhaps most strikingly, five years ago, 13 of these countries were strongly allied with the West. Today, only 6 countries or territories in the WTW Index rate as strong Western allies (including Jordan, Mexico, Qatar and Taiwan). Meanwhile, 7 are rated as leaning strongly East (including Belarus, China, Mali, Myanmar and Russia).
"" The main driver of these losses appears to be ""dealignment"" "" emerging market countries are increasingly seeking advantage by playing the superpowers off against each other. This trend is particularly evident in countries that wish to avoid censure on grounds of human rights or political freedom, such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Cameroon, and Uganda.
"" Foreign investors face substantial risks from these geopolitical trends. In countries that shifted East (from neutrality or a Western alignment) over the past five years, on average, expropriation risks rose by 7% and political rights fell by 10%. In ""dealigning"" countries, each of these risk indicators also worsened, and the dealignment trend is impacting more countries. #politicalrisk #geopolitics",Geopolitics
"We are entering an era of great global turbulence. Leaders of big business now need to go beyond ESG and focus harder and deeper on a set of the most critical societal issues. That's the nub of this commentary I wrote jointly with Ian Davis, former chair and global MD of McKinsey.
A condensed version of the piece was published by The Economist last week. Delighted to have this extended version featured by the LSE's Grantham Institute.
We argue that the response of global businesses to current societal challenges is patchy and inadequate. Whether on climate change, geopolitical divisions, the risks of AI, etc, corporate actions do not match the scale of the problems. This is notwithstanding all those well-meaning ESG initiatives.
We offer three basic recommendations for CEOs of big companies:
1. Build a much deeper understanding of societal challenges, how they might evolve and how they might impact their businesses.
2. Focus more narrowly on the few societal issues which are most critical to the business and drive management of these issues deeper into corporate strategy.
3. Mobilize more powerful coalitions, with governments at the core, to help tackle the issues.
Many of these points have been made by others. If properly implemented together they would have important consequences.
CEOs would concentrate on the highest-impact actions needed on the biggest societal problems their companies face or have helped unleash.
Technology giants would focus much harder on heading off potential AI-related disasters. Big Oil would seek to mobilize the entire industry to curb oil and gas production. CEOs of many global companies would engage more actively with governments to head off geopolitical conflict. And so on.
This level of corporate ambition and focus on such issues has historical precedents. At various points in the past, we argue, large companies have mobilized powerfully behind or alongside governments to tackle big societal challenges.
Comments welcome. All views my own, as always.
Many excellent colleagues have contributed to my thinking on these issues, including at ERM, Critical Resource - an ERM Group Company, and Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change & the Environment. Tim Cooper Sabine Hoefnagel Alaric Marsden.

"asi #Energy and YZ#geopolitics have always been closely linked!
I had the pleasure to speak at the EY #Energy summit in #Rome about the impact of current #geopolitical trends on the #energytransition
Some of the points I made about the future geopolitical environment:
1. Based on my team's #scenario analysis on the #future of #globalisation we are moving towards a world in which the nature of geopolitical relations will matter much more (for details here: https://lnkd.in/gRHqH7_x)
2. There is a #paradigm #shift away from economic rationality and cost efficiency towards geopolitical and national security considerations: Geopolitics will determine #energy #security and hence shape energy markets. This will impact both fossil fuel and renewable energy supply chains.
3. While the war in Ukraine has posed an #energy #trilemma which saw a short-term emphasis on security of supply and affordability, in the medium-term #sustainability will remain a central goal. Also because in the long-term the energy transition will allow Europe to reduce its dependencies.
And these will be some of the many #implications:
1. Energy, energy #infrastructure and the #technologies linked to the transition will be at the center of #geostrategic #competition. They will therefore become a #tool and a #target of geopolitics.
2. There will be more #state #interventionism and industrial policy to secure national/European interests. This creates risks and opportunities and means #volatility and unpredictability.
3. Expect a #patchwork of #regulations and incentives within the #EU and globally. This will create a more complex operating environment.
4. On top of the ""old"" #dependencies (fossil fuels), new ones will emerge from the #renewable energy #supplychains which are more diffuse and complex.

a... Optimistic message: all stakeholders are taking seriously ESG issues
a... Companies will be more accountable about their positions and relationship with the trade associations

"Can changes in the tone of local media articles predict where #conflict will break out? In this new white paper, Anne Jamison, Kristian Hoelscher, Brian Ganson, Witold Henisz and I take a first step to building that link. We draw on #GDELT's global database of more than five billion media articles to test the relationship between media-reported sentiment and conflict events.
We find that a worsening in media sentiment is significantly associated with future conflict events as measured by the #ACLED, #SCAD and #UCDP-GED conflict datasets. We find that this is true one day before, three days before, seven days before, fourteen days before, and thirty days before conflict, but the effect size is larger where temporal proximity is closer. Moreover, as media sentiment becomes more positive, we see fewer future conflicts.
We propose that media #sentiment analysis can help us analyze conflict escalation processes more precisely. While our findings may be a bit intuitive, they provide new empirical evidence for #peace and #conflict research where previously we relied on anecdotes, represent an advance in understandings of the media-conflict relationship, and can help generate more accurate early warning conflict tools for policymakers, local populations, and other stakeholders.

"An interesting thing happening with fiat-backed stablecoins. They benefit from the deeply underserved demand for USD as a reserve currency and are creeping into the top 10 holders of US Treasurys

Some potential implications:

1. Non-US consumers worldwide are a large holder of US Treasurys (or stated differently, the US Govt is increasingly borrowing directly from non-US consumer s)
2. Defi makes it easier for a non-US citizen to buy stables than for a US citizen to buy USTs

3. Our model for financial contagion in a crisis is already outdated; instability in money markets and stables probably will interact with each other in unpredictable ways 

4. The decoupling of US-China probably won't play out as linearly as we think it will

5. Tools for capital controls probably need to adapt in order for governments around the world to manage the fact that money that used to sit in locally denominated savings accounts now essentially sit in USD",Geopolitics

"Fantastic to be back in China this week to see our Mativ teams and partners in Suzhou and the surrounding area. Huge thanks to Kelly Huang for keeping Michael Woody, Joe Soldano, Peter Roebuck, and me organized and energized throughout the visit. Also to Dana Sheridan for making sure we got everywhere we needed to be and generally avoided getting lost!A major highlight of the trip was visiting our factory in Suzhou, where Stephen Shu, Charlie Ni and the whole team are doing great work to deliver Delstar and GESSNER products safely and with high quality. Great to see the focus on building a world-class #safety culture - the safety experience room was awesome! Love the pride and passion in #manufacturing on display here, and it shows through in the results being achieved. Thanks as well to Amy Liu for your leadership on #supplychain and S&OP, really good work happening in these areas.",Geopolitics
"The six Wave 2 AP1000 Reactors under construction in China will be built in record time and will operate safely for 80 to 100 years producing nearly 1200MWe safely. The four Wave 1 AP1000 reactors are operating with the highest capacity factors of any of the plants in China. We now have two AP1000 reactors operating safely at Vogtle and we can expect the same excellent performance. We will never get to Nth of a kind economics for new nuclear in this country if we don't continue building past the First Units and deal with FOAK learnings. We need an active construction program in the US building proven designs. With all the new reactors concepts being thrown around most are not out of the concept stage that will not be deployable until the 2030s and will all have their FOAK issues. The US doesn't need more Power Points, we need more Power Plants.",Geopolitics
