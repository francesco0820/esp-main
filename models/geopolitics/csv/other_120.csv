"â€œAccelerated approval should be an established pathway in rare disease but the truth is only a handful of non-oncology rare diseases have been approved via accelerated approval. Itâ€™s time to push for an Orphan Drug Act 2.0 to put precision medicine to work for ultra-rare diseases.â€ - Emil Kakkis, MD, PhD, CEO of Ultragenyx, speaking at the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus briefing during #RareDiseaseWeek.

"Llama 2 has massively shifted the GenAI ecosystem, but is it as good as ChatGPT? Yes! For factual summarization both Llama 2 70B and GPT-4 are close to human performance, and Llama 2 70b is 30x cheaper. This is based on a carefully curated human dataset of factual summarization with 373 examples, each with a correct and incorrect summary we ask the models to rank.
Along the way, we take a few really interesting detours that provide their own valuable insights. Firstly, Llama 2â€™s tokenization is ~20% larger than ChatGPTs, so this needs to be taken into account for costs. Secondly, the Llama 2 models are not as good at following instructions as the ChatGPT models, and require additional post-processing (and insist on giving explanations that you have to pay for as generated tokens). Thirdly, when using LLMs for evaluation of two options, be very careful about ordering bias â€“ most LLMs will have a strong preference for either the first or second option.

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for â€œBidenomicsâ€. Unemployment hasnâ€™t been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Bidenâ€™s team seems to have engineered the rare â€œsoft landingâ€ where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" â€” the worldâ€™s most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. Americaâ€™s greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Bidenâ€™s leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on Americaâ€™s constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putinâ€™s brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administrationâ€™s policies. President Bidenâ€™s appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook

"Letâ€™s set a rule for companies that talk about the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions that they serve.

It is one thing for people to have access to a benefit or a service.

It is another thing for them to be actually *using* it.

Too many distracting companies and services and benefits that are underutilized.

Sometimes this underutilization is *by design* and made difficult for people to access.

We are caught up celebrating the wrong things.

Lives truly impacted is not the same thing as *users.*",

"Having played soccer for the greatest university in the world - aka Georgetown University - and been a lifelong fan of the US Womenâ€™s National Team, Iâ€™m a firm believer that leaders can take many important lessons and experiences from the soccer field (and any sports field/court/arena for that matter). Thatâ€™s why I couldnâ€™t have been more energized to sit down with my friend and U.S. Soccer Federation President Cindy Parlow Cone recently to talk about her unexpected career journey, how she leads with humility to make decisions, what her process is for building a team, as well as how her teams are expanding access, advancing inclusion, and fostering belonging across the sport. âš½ This clip is one of my favorite topics we discussed: the â€œscoreboardâ€ to measure leadership success. For some, success is as simple as the performance of the most visible part of a team or organization â€“ that might mean in Cindyâ€™s case: national soccer team victories, or me at Deloitte Consulting: our consulting businessâ€™s growth rate. But success needs to be measured much more broadly; itâ€™s about culture, itâ€™s about broader societal impact, itâ€™s about things you can measure and things you canâ€™t. Hear how Cindy measures success across US Soccerâ€™s many priorities and encourages people around her to think about success wholistically. How do you define success and what are some ways you track it? #Deloitte #USWNT #Leadership #Success",

Iâ€™m here at a CLA (CliftonLarsonAllen)-organized event four months later. A lovely dinner with early-career professionals and some FGCU alumni served as a great kick-off. We spoke extensively about the things that excite young professionals, and firm culture frequently came up.

"A few weeks ago, I saw Taylor Swift perform, and I was blown away.
I am not a huge fan; I like her music on the radio, but Iâ€™ve never bought or downloaded an album. I only know the songs on the radio. But I must say, it was the most inspiring performance Iâ€™ve ever seen. And not just because sheâ€™s a great entertainer â€“ there is no doubt that she is â€“ but because I walked away feeling empowered to go after my dreams.
Why?
Her storytelling and unapologetically authentic love for what she does made me want to be better at what I do. I will be 45 years old this year; I am a reasonably self-confident person. And I walked away feeling empowered. Like I could do anything I put my mind to. And I wanted to go for it!
Now I get why sheâ€™s loved. She makes people believe in themselves.
And thatâ€™s what I want to do, too.

"Fun interview with the energetic and insightful Nabil Ahmed.
Me: To begin, then, how did we get here? Which is to say, what are the winds behind the sails of the uber wealthyâ€™s super yachts? How have the very wealthy and corporations hijacked our economy? Why has it gotten so much more extreme in the wake of the pandemic?
Nabil Ahmed: The starting point is recognizing that we arrived here not by accident but by economic and political choices that were made by our governments that widened the great divide of economic inequality.
These were already in full swing prior to the pandemic. For decades weâ€™ve seen structural policy shifts that have increased inequalityâ€”from a surge in monopoly power to the erosion of workersâ€™ rights and labor market liberalization to the privatization of public goods like health and education to the erosion of tax rates on the richest people and corporations.
Since 1995, for example, the top one percent has grabbed nearly 20 times more wealth than humanityâ€™s bottom 50 percent This era has grown the wealth and the power of those at the very top and not so much left but actually pushed so many behind â€“ and in doing so, made us all less safe, and less resilient to massive shocks.",

"Like millions of others, my family and I jumped on the Ted Lasso wagon. During a time when people were isolated (the pandemic), it was the perfect antidote to bring people together.
There are far too many takeaways to list, but now that it's ended, I wanted to share some of the lessons that resonated with me.
I hope that we all carry a little Ted in our hearts. And, be a goldfish.
If you watched, drop me a line. I'd love to hear your thoughts about what you enjoyed most about it.

At Milk Makeup, we believe in the power of giving back, and today, we are thrilled to share a heartfelt initiative that is close to our hearts. As a part of the Milk Makeup Gives Back section of our 2nd annual summit, we are delighted to announce our partnership with the Chill Foundation, a remarkable non-profit organization.
The Chill Foundation is dedicated to offering BIPOC youth a unique opportunity that blends boardsports, skill growth, and community engagement. This incredible blend fosters empowerment and creates a long-term positive impact that goes beyond the skatepark.
As a part of this partnership, we are committed to funding two of the fall NYC skate programs and will also be designing 15 skateboards and 15 skate helmets using various art supplies. These vibrant skateboards and helmets will then be delivered to Chill youth in NYC, ensuring that these young people can continue to ride, beyond their Chill skate program experience.
A huge thank you to the Chill Foundation, who will be on-site to help us build these skateboards and support this wonderful program. Their dedication to empowering the youth through sports and community engagement is truly inspiring, and we're honored to be a part of their mission.

"The peak of Covid became a two-front warâ€” the virus itself and misinformation. Dr. Nidhi Nikhanj, a great friend of mine and the cornerstone of my good old days of residency at The George Washington University Hospital, sat at the forefront of it, in the clinic.
In chapter two of â€œDead Wrong: Diagnosing and Treating Healthcare's Misinformation Illness"", Nidhi led me to examine Covid-19 in a way that ultimately showed me how high-stakes this misinformation illness and its compounding effects had become, pandemic or not.
Misinformation thrives on desperation and our modern society provides the perfect place for it to thrive. In healthcareâ€™s fight against misinformation, doing nothing means losing everything. But doing no harm means doing everything we can, right now.
Hear more from Dr. Nidhi Nikhanj and industry experts, Peter Hotez MD PhD and Megan Ranney, in the second chapter of my book as we investigate misinformation through the lens of the Covid-19 pandemic.

"This past April, the Hackfest community tragically lost one of their own. Josh Arsenio embodied the best qualities of any human. He was a terrific friend, mentor, and supporter of the security industry. Josh was an individual known for going out of his way to support those in need, especially when it came to extending his professional network to assist those looking for new opportunities.
The Hackfest event will truly never be the same without Joshâ€™s wit, charm and undeniable style. To honor his memory, and ensure that Josh is forever part of the community we have permanently renamed the opening cocktail event to â€œJosh Arsenioâ€™s Networking Eventâ€.
We hope that you join us this year to not only celebrate the life of our dear friend, but to also use this opportunity to expand your own network within the community.
We are honored to have known Josh, and are eternally grateful for the support he showed to the Hackfest and Canadian cybersecurity communities over the years.

"I will never forget when I told my boss that I needed help. It was 2006 and I was a mess. I was miserable in life and at work. We both knew I was failing, but I was too scared to admit it. Until one fateful day when my life came crashing down, and I finally mustered the courage to admit that I wasn't going to succeed and that I needed to make a change.
And he did what a great boss should. He listened. He helped me transition out of the company so I could move back to Colorado. He never shamed me. He never belittled me. He just offered a bit of help.
In last week's episode of Reflect Foward: Advice From a CEO, I share my advice on how to best help an employee who opens up about mental health challenges.
Why? Because these are important conversations. And they are going to happen more and more. Leaders can't avoid them; rather, they need to lean in and lend a helping hand. It's amazing what a bit of help can do.
