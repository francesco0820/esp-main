"This week I returned to Norway for Arendalsuka, or Arendal Week, the annual gathering in Norway dedicated to political empowerment, democracy, and openness.
This was my second time at the event, and I left feeling even more inspired than last year. Why? In three words: resilience, collaboration, and courage.
Geopolitics, climate change, shifting demographics, tech innovation. Navigating any one of these would be enough to define a career. Leaders today face all four at once.
The leaders I spoke with in Norway are focused on building their resilience muscles to meet this moment. They are finding ways to not only recover""but recover stronger and thrive as disruptions continue. And they are finding the best solutions in the world for problems that don't respect borders.
What does this take? One thing is agility, the ability to act and react quickly without stumbling. Another is balance, the notion that you're managing for near-term performance without losing sight of long-term potential.
Lastly, it takes real courage. The courage to be decisive and move fast amid persistent headwinds. Leaders in Arendal exemplified these qualities. I aspire to do the same. You can learn more about building a resilience agenda here: https://lnkd.in/gnnsaE2P

"We hear many stories of courage here at Pfizer. Recently, I was inspired by the essays in our 2023 Pride Journal, where our LGBTQ+ colleagues shared their personal experiences of struggles, triumphs, and hopes for the future in honor of Pride Month.

"This was one of the best weeks - intense but rewarding as I visited clients and colleagues across Europe. I joined Marsh McLennan (MMC) CEO John Doyle (my boss), and the leaders of all four MMC businesses on a tour of Zurich, Milan, Munich and Paris.
We met with over 30 clients across 15 institutions, and with Oliver Wyman (OW) and MMC colleagues in each city, including a pan-European town hall beamed from Munich in mid-week.
Three main observations from our meetings:
Firstly I'm a Steven Pinker-following optimist, but nonetheless the challenges facing companies continue to wash ashore with ever-greater frequency. Some call it a permacrisis, or even a polycrisis; but there are many exciting opportunities embedded in this disruption. All week we discussed:
- Boosting resilience in the face of climate change, geopolitical tensions and other risks (a topic across Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman).
- Financing the energy transition (OW's teams have been doing enormous amounts of work in this space, and we think MMC has an unprecedented range of offerings to support clients).
- Shortening, and gaining greater visibility into, supply chains (where my colleagues Amy Barnes and Jonathan Lee are doing some groundbreaking work to develop new analytics for clients).
- The changing world of work, and the threats and opportunities of generative AI (where Mercer colleagues Martine, Ravin and Kate literally wrote the book).
- As well, of course, as the challenges and opportunities in the local and global insurance markets (thank you to Martin, Dean, Dorothee and Christos, who were my tutors this week) and the investments world.
Secondly that in the face of these challenges and opportunities clients react very well when we carefully bring together the Strategy, Risk and People expertise across our businesses "" by carefully I mean well-targeted to solving their problem at the most senior levels of their organisation.
And thirdly that OW is very much on the march. I met with colleagues in all the locations working on multiple large, complex projects with clients. This is where we want to work, supporting our clients through their transformative moments. Whether they are building new client offerings, transforming their revenue and cost performance, working through a deal or responding to a regulator-or investor-mandated change, we want to earn to right to be their Partner. And in Zurich and Munich, the recent Fink study ranked us as a top three strategy consulting firm in multiple sectors.
Critically when the actual client project leaders are asked for their opinion, OW is number one. This is how we want to work, and what we want to be known for "" matchless depth of expertise, delivered in a collaborative way that equips our clients for their own transformation.
I feel inspired for the next phase of our work to build the OW and MMC civilizations.

"All people deserve to live their healthiest lives possible, no matter where they live, and that's why I'm really grateful to have been involved with PATH as a board member for many years. Recently, I was lucky to be able to visit Vietnam with PATH to learn more about the work they're doing to help drive innovation and improve health outcomes for people there. It was an eye-opening experience to see first-hand the impact of this work.
Part of PATH's mission has always been to help solve the world's most pressing health challenges, and I can't think of a bigger challenge than the recent pandemic. Back in 2020, Amazon made a commitment to help workers in our supply chain rebuild after being hit hard by the effects of the pandemic, and we were looking for nonprofit organizations to partner with us. PATH was one of the organizations that we worked with""in Vietnam we were able to support over 20K workers in our supply chain through health screenings, trainings, and more. We also co-developed a web-based health education platform for our workers, that ended up being adopted by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health "" National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health, which made it accessible to thousands outside of our immediate network. You can check out more about this project: https://lnkd.in/grERYDjq

"I'm just back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where the focus of this year's meeting was timely: Cooperation in a Fragmented World. Faced with constrained fiscal space and a world that seems to be spinning apart, what hope is there for collaboration that requires multilateral support? In Davos, leaders explored the geopolitical and economic implications of this trend. But I was disappointed to hear fewer people talk about the implications for global health and climate adaptation. Partnerships like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, saved millions of lives in the first two decades of the 21st century. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed and, in some cases, reversed that hard-won progress. There have been bright spots, including the strong show of support at the Global Fund's seventh replenishment last October. But this moment demands more. As a foundation, we're guided by the Sustainable Development Goals. Every country in the United Nations signed onto these targets. Now, governments need to follow through on the commitments they made to their citizens with the political will and resources required. Between the upcoming G7 summit in Japan and the G20 summit in India, there are many opportunities ahead to recommit "" not just with words, but action. We can't lurch from crisis to crisis or wait for another massive global health tragedy to spark action. All of us "" philanthropies, governments, civil society, and the private sector "" must step up. We must ensure the pipeline of innovation is set up to meet the great needs of this moment, and to deliver the next generation of tools as soon as they're ready. The stakes are high. We could end polio, bring malaria to near zero, help farmers adapt to climate change, and massively improve the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions over the next decade. We could be a part of ushering in a more equitable world, or simply a world more prepared for the next potential pandemic. Any way you look at it, the investment is worth the effort.",Geopolitics

"Can changes in the tone of local media articles predict where #conflict will break out? In this new white paper, Anne Jamison, Kristian Hoelscher, Brian Ganson, Witold Henisz and I take a first step to building that link. We draw on #GDELT's global database of more than five billion media articles to test the relationship between media-reported sentiment and conflict events.
We find that a worsening in media sentiment is significantly associated with future conflict events as measured by the #ACLED, #SCAD and #UCDP-GED conflict datasets. We find that this is true one day before, three days before, seven days before, fourteen days before, and thirty days before conflict, but the effect size is larger where temporal proximity is closer. Moreover, as media sentiment becomes more positive, we see fewer future conflicts.
We propose that media #sentiment analysis can help us analyze conflict escalation processes more precisely. While our findings may be a bit intuitive, they provide new empirical evidence for #peace and #conflict research where previously we relied on anecdotes, represent an advance in understandings of the media-conflict relationship, and can help generate more accurate early warning conflict tools for policymakers, local populations, and other stakeholders.

"In two days we'll be publishing a new report, ""mapping the new geopolitical divides,"" showing how the emerging world is increasingly divided between West and East, and the consequences for business.
The full report including profiles for all 61 countries/territories covered is at: https://lnkd.in/g2fjPHxV
Main findings:
"" The Western bloc has lost ground in all world regions. Five years ago, 30 of the 61 countries/territories we analyzed were in the Western bloc. Perhaps most strikingly, five years ago, 13 of these countries were strongly allied with the West. Today, only 6 countries or territories in the WTW Index rate as strong Western allies (including Jordan, Mexico, Qatar and Taiwan). Meanwhile, 7 are rated as leaning strongly East (including Belarus, China, Mali, Myanmar and Russia).
"" The main driver of these losses appears to be ""dealignment"" "" emerging market countries are increasingly seeking advantage by playing the superpowers off against each other. This trend is particularly evident in countries that wish to avoid censure on grounds of human rights or political freedom, such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Cameroon, and Uganda.
"" Foreign investors face substantial risks from these geopolitical trends. In countries that shifted East (from neutrality or a Western alignment) over the past five years, on average, expropriation risks rose by 7% and political rights fell by 10%. In ""dealigning"" countries, each of these risk indicators also worsened, and the dealignment trend is impacting more countries. #politicalrisk #geopolitics",Geopolitics

We had a tortured discussion about whether this company could use the term ""Rohingya"" in its own communications. International human rights NGOs wanted this, but it also seemed to increase the possibility of government retaliation against this firm, and potentially more broadly.
I was reminded of this today, reading this article from Saijel Kishan and team at Bloomberg, on how investors are becoming ""coy"" about using terms like ESG and climate change. According to the article, these terms are down by half on analyst calls, compared to a year ago.
It is staggering to me how open to extortion of this kind the US corporate sector is. Notably, Brazil is polarized in an almost identical way, but firms there have not been drawn into this kind of rhetorical/campaign finance mire.
The Republican strategy on these issues is also ""ESG"" it just uses the criteria as exclusions. In a free market, surely people can do what they want with their money.
Liberals are constantly in my inbox asking why companies don't stop funding these politicians. The short answer is that this is all a big corrupt racket and so few have the courage to call it and make a more decisive move. So the problems will perpetuate.
It probably is good if we stop using the term ESG and talk instead about material risk, opportunity, and the need for ethical guardrails. So this is the right evolution for the wrong reasons.
