"This week, I joined fellow health sector leaders at the Health Evolution Summit to discuss how we can safely leverage tech, digital tools, and personalization without compromising patient privacy to bring about much-needed, meaningful change to health care. I spoke about how a distributed data network platform model of care can resolve the seeming paradox for health systems of meeting patient expectations for personalized care while safeguarding sensitive data and protecting privacy resulting in improved outcomes for all.
These concepts can and should co-exist, but doing so requires health careâ€™s main players to come together in changing our approach and building a new platform model for health care. #HESummit23",Data privacy and cybersecurity

The result is based on feedback from 2,200+ patient groups from around the world.

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from â€œpure merit.â€
Usual arguments for â€œpure meritâ€ include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measureâ€”we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someoneâ€™s resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to sayâ€”whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the landâ€”we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for â€œBidenomicsâ€. Unemployment hasnâ€™t been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Bidenâ€™s team seems to have engineered the rare â€œsoft landingâ€ where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" â€” the worldâ€™s most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. Americaâ€™s greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Bidenâ€™s leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on Americaâ€™s constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putinâ€™s brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administrationâ€™s policies. President Bidenâ€™s appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook
"The Real Estate Roundtable, a great industry organization focused on education and information sharing, recently published its Q1 2023 Sentiment Survey. As expected, uncertainty around price discovery, future interest rates and recession risk remain primary concerns, which in turn is leading to larger bid-ask spreads and hindered CRE trading volumes. On a positive note, investor sentiment recovered from the fourth quarter low, and expectations for improving capital market conditions over the next 12 months, also stood out. Our own findings, based on Marcus & Millichapâ€™s proprietary research and investor surveys, are consistent with the general theme of the Roundtableâ€™s report. Importantly, we reiterate as does the report, that generalizations by property type and/or market, can result in missed investment opportunities.

"This week I returned to Norway for Arendalsuka, or Arendal Week, the annual gathering in Norway dedicated to political empowerment, democracy, and openness.
This was my second time at the event, and I left feeling even more inspired than last year. Why? In three words: resilience, collaboration, and courage.
Geopolitics, climate change, shifting demographics, tech innovation. Navigating any one of these would be enough to define a career. Leaders today face all four at once.
The leaders I spoke with in Norway are focused on building their resilience muscles to meet this moment. They are finding ways to not only recoverâ€”but recover stronger and thrive as disruptions continue. And they are finding the best solutions in the world for problems that donâ€™t respect borders.
What does this take? One thing is agility, the ability to act and react quickly without stumbling. Another is balance, the notion that youâ€™re managing for near-term performance without losing sight of long-term potential.
Lastly, it takes real courage. The courage to be decisive and move fast amid persistent headwinds. Leaders in Arendal exemplified these qualities. I aspire to do the same. You can learn more about building a resilience agenda here: https://lnkd.in/gnnsaE2P

"The #jobs report from last week painted a picture of both growth and slowing in the labor market. Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates.

"Today is National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, a day to remember all who have been lost to this devastating epidemic and to increase awareness of this growing threat to all families. Fentanyl is now the #1 cause of death in the U.S. among adults younger than 45 years old. On June 1, this became more than a statistic to us when our 31-year-old son Connor died from fentanyl poisoning. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine. It is a legitimate pharmaceutical used as an anesthetic during surgery and as an analgesic for the treatment of breakthrough pain. However, because it is inexpensive to manufacture and highly addictive, Mexican drug cartels using Chinese supplied precursor chemicals are adding fentanyl to virtually all illicitly supplied drugs, including counterfeit prescription medicines. Sometimes users are aware they are taking fentanyl, but often they are not. Because of poor quality control, any one pill can include a lethal doseâ€¦thus the DEAâ€™s awareness campaign: â€œOne pill can kill.â€
My son was recently married, had a successful career, was a leader of teams, with a large support group of loving family and friends, and he was a long-time sufferer of chronic pain stemming from sports injuries. He thought he was getting Oxycontin from someone he knew, but one of the pills was laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl that likely killed him instantly. Doctors, pilots, attorneys, teachers, teenagers, and others from all demographic and socioeconomic groups taking what they believe to be Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, or Adderall. Dying from fentanyl poisoning.
There are no easy answers, and it will get worse before it gets better. The addictive power and profit motive too great. It is a war being waged against us that is costing billions of dollars and killing some of our best and brightest. The only control most of us have over an uncontrollable situation is to be prepared to save someoneâ€™s life. Nalaxone (Narcan) is a cheap and now widely available drug that can be easily administered to someone in distress or dying from any opioid overdose â€“ including fentanyl. Itâ€™s a cheap, easy-to-use, miracle antidote. But you have to have it within reach. 911 is too late. Naloxone will soon be available OTC. Put one in your car, office, or briefcase/purse. Or all three. Think of it as like an AED, except smaller, cheaper, easier, and more effective. And something you are more likely to use, statistically. You may think there is no need to have one, that you donâ€™t know anybody at risk, but neither did I.
Given the rapid growth in opioid deaths, there are two groups of people in the U.S. nowâ€¦those who know someone who has died from an opioid overdose and those who will. You can potentially save someoneâ€™s life by being preparedâ€¦buy them some time to figure it out, get the help they need. And maybe spare another parent the excruciating pain of losing a child.",MISC

Yesterday, was one of those momentsâ€¦

This model is an important contribution to healthcareâ€™s #AgeFriendly movement. It offers a standard approach to dementia care, including 24/7 access to a support line as well as caregiver training, education, and support services. Knowing that dementia imposes significant financial, emotional, and logistical burdens on families that are often exacerbated for certain racial and ethnic groups, the GUIDE model was designed to reduce disparities in access to dementia services, and it incorporates policies to advance #HealthEquity.
This Fall, CMMI will issue an RFA to help test the GUIDE model and alternative payment for organizations that deliver supportive services to people with dementia. Organizations that provide care to underserved communities are encouraged to apply. A variety of financial and technical supports will be available to ensure that participating safety-net providers can develop their infrastructure, improve their care delivery capabilities, and participate successfully in the model. Until the RFA is issued, interested folks can submit to CMS a Letter of Intent by September 15. Iâ€™m looking forward to following the impact of this work!

"On Monday, March 6, Sylvia Lopez, whoâ€™s a Care Manager at SCAN called a member Iâ€™ll call MaryAnn.
MaryAnn was a new member. She is dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and so she recently enrolled in our Connections plan.
Sylvia thought sheâ€™d be doing a quick, routine health assessment.
Well, hereâ€™s what Sylvia quickly learned:
â€¢ MaryAnn is 81 years old.
â€¢ She experiences forgetfulness and has uncontrolled pain in her ankles, knees and back. Sheâ€™s got other ailments including hypertension, and incontinence.
â€¢ She fell out of her bed recently.
â€¢ She canâ€™t really take care of herself anymore. She canâ€™t cook or clean her apartment.
â€¢ MaryAnn also lives alone. Her daughter used to care for her, but her daughter passed away from COVID.
In addition, MaryAnn was hungry.
Remember, Sylvia called her on a Monday. MaryAnn hadnâ€™t had a meal since the preceding Friday.
She was signed up with Meals on Wheels, but the portions were small and her next delivery wasnâ€™t due until the next day.
MaryAnn couldnâ€™t go to the local supermarket. A taxi would cost her $20, and she didnâ€™t have the money, since sheâ€™d used it to take a taxi to her last doctorâ€™s appointment.
She had half a jar of peanut butter in her house, and she was rationing 2 tablespoons of peanut butter every 3-4 hours. 2 tablespoons. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. Imagine that.
So hereâ€™s where Sylvia stepped in. First, she got her authorization for Chronic Condition meals so sheâ€™d have food right away.
Her independent living benefit wasnâ€™t due to kick in until April 1, but she was hungry, so the SCAN team didnâ€™t waste any time approving her for immediate food delivery.
Then, Sylvia called Meals on Wheels America to make sure the delivery would be made the next day.
She also explained to MaryAnn that as a SCAN member she had a transportation benefit, which she could use to get to the doctor and the supermarket.
And then, the next day, Sylvia called MaryAnn again. She made sure she sheâ€™d gotten her meals.
She went over how to arrange transportation.
She told her SCAN would be sending her extra meals for as long as she needed them.
In addition, she got MaryAnn incontinence supplies and a SCAN Personal Emergency Response System so she can call for help if she falls or if she needs medical help.
She also helped arrange for a caregiver to come to MaryAnnâ€™s home three times a week to assist her with personal care and homemaking.
At the end of Sylviaâ€™s and MaryAnnâ€™s call, MaryAnn told Sylvia sheâ€™d had a dream the night after they spoke. â€œIn the dream, an angel came to me,â€ MaryAnn told Sylvia. â€œAnd the angel was you.â€
We often talk about models to address the needs of complex patients.
What we donâ€™t talk about is the incredible empathy, passion, and dedication required to serve these patients day-in, day-out.
Thank you, Sylvia!",MISC

"Why do businesses play a key role in advancing #HealthEquity? Because employers own some of the major drivers of health #disparitiesâ€”determinants such as income, economic stability, benefits (PTO, health insurance, mental health supports), and social conditions in the communities in which they operate. With this power comes a responsibility to act.
Business leaders looking for a place to start should consider this excellent piece from Harvard Business Review: https://bit.ly/3CHNvCp.
Authors Shantanu Nundy Lisa Cooper, and Ellen Kelsay outline several opportunities that companies can pursue to improve health equity among their employees and communities. Take note and take action!
â€œBy using a health equity lens and proven strategies to eliminate disparities, employers can improve business outcomes, create a better employee experience, and advance health for all.â€

"I enjoyed kicking off Yahoo Finance Healthcare Week this morning with Anjalee Khemlani. We talked about the loss of the â€œsoul of the healthcare systemâ€ and the devolution of the physician-patient relationship into a series of transactions that has been driven by digital and retail health. We talked about the excessive focus on metrics to the exclusion of focus on patients. And we talked about SCANâ€™s emerging efforts to help address the needs of people experiencing homelessnes and also our efforts to reduce the costs of prescription medicines for older adults.
Take a listen and let us know what you think!",MISC
