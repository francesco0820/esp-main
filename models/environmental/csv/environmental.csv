Although access to healthcare remains our primary focus in terms of ESG commitments, this year we chose to go beyond this subject and shared our efforts on environmental #sustainability. The event covered topics ranging from carbon emissions and energy use (Scott Hemphill), to sustainable construction (Georg Singewald), product stewardship (Ursina Kohler) and water and waste management (Richard Huerzeler). We also had Marielle Beyer speak about our efforts to drive sustainability in our procurement operations and across the entire value chain.

"Things are starting to move in Switzerland! Earlier this week, I had the honor of being part of a panel on the first Swiss #Sustainability Day organized by InTent. The topic was â€œHow to Integrate Sustainability into Your Business Model? - From Principles into actionsâ€.
More than exchanging with NGOs, policymakers, and representatives from small and large actors, I appreciated our shared sense of urgency and desire to actively tackle sustainability on all fronts, across industries. We can no longer create value without thinking of the consequences in the long term. For prosperity to be inclusive and sustainable, we need to create an accounting system measuring impact and not just financial flows.
At Roche, we go beyond CO2 reduction and resource allocation - we understand that increasing access to patients has a far greater impact on the world.

"The allegory of Plato's Cave is one of my favorites -- it highlights the difference between the â€œrealityâ€ of peopleâ€™s sensory understandings compared to real knowledge. Until recently, the topic of ESG has been stuck in a similar cave, where it is hard to tell what is real and what is rhetoric. Today, Novata released the broadest collection of ESG benchmarks in the private markets. Now, there are accurate examples of what good looks like across hundreds of critical measures. This means ESG metrics can finally be effectively linked to financial materiality, which is how we reframe the ESG debateâ€”not through discord, but with data.

"With hashtag#COP28 underway, I wanted to share some insights from a conversation I recently had with Christiana Figueres for my latest podcast episode. Christiana is the former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change. In this episode, she talks about how embracing an optimistic mindset helped her lead the process that secured the Paris Agreement, and how she now applies this way of thinking to our current challenge: that we need to execute climate solutions much faster and at greater scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. â€œOptimism,â€ she said, â€œis not the output. Itâ€™s the input. Itâ€™s the mindset. It is the focus of our attention and our conviction that we actually have everything that it takes to solve a problem.â€
One reality is that we are behind. The other reality is that, with technology, we are â€œway forward, way faster, than we ever thought possible.â€ I agree with Christiana that now is the moment to set these two realities side by side â€“ â€œto see them in equal importanceâ€ â€“ and get to work. Yes, we are behind. But we can still catch up and build a sustainable net-zero future. And Iâ€™m proud that, at COP 28, Siemens is in the Green Zone showcasing technology to make this possible.
After all, as Christiana said, if energy is driving 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy can also be 75 percent of the solution. hashtag#OptimisticOutlook",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"This is a critical moment in the effort to build a sustainable future, as many wonder if climate objectives such as the Paris Agreement can still be realized.
The opportunity is clear: technology has advanced far more rapidly than climate experts anticipated. But hereâ€™s the challenge: achieving climate goals now requires us to apply these technologies much faster.
Siemens has accepted this challenge, and I had a chance to share our plan of action at last weekâ€™s CECP CEO Investor Forum focused on climate change. I shared how the intention of our strong sustainability governance and ESG framework, DEGREE, is to increase the speed for achieving our own hashtag#NetZero commitments and helping customers to achieve theirs.
This was on the heels of Siemens reporting record earnings as we continue to accelerate our customersâ€™ digital and hashtag#sustainability transformations. Today, more than 90 percent of our global revenue comes from a portfolio that enables sustainability impact.
Customers deploying our technologies are able to reduce energy consumption; theyâ€™re able to use fewer resources; theyâ€™re able to advance decarbonization. Butâ€™s it not just about using less; itâ€™s also about doing more.
The technologies advancing decarbonization also bolster productivity. They generate strong business results and improve operational performance. And our strategy to help customers combine the real and digital worlds now offers a path forward for increasing speed and scale. The more we work on real-world processes and things in the digital world, the sooner we will build a sustainable future.
The question I closed with is: What is the cost of doing nothing? As business leaders, we have to look at our business cases in a new light. We must realize there are very rational judgments to be made when it comes to decarbonization. These rational judgements will lead us to the right kind of action within our organizations.
But if we do not drive change fast enough, what are the future impacts to our businesses and to society? Acting now with what we have is better than waiting for a perfect solution that may or may not arrive in the future. And at Siemens, we see that this commitment to hashtag#decarbonization â€“ to accelerating action â€“ is not only a vital responsibility; itâ€™s really the basis for our future business growth. hashtag#CEOInvestorForum",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"Next week is Climate Week NYC, an annual event focused on climate action and what we can do across the public and private sectors to help drive it. Here are two points I'm thinking about ahead of the event:
1. Not only can climate change be addressed, but we can address it fast enough if we work together.
2. Digitalization is a powerful ally on the path to #NetZero. In bringing together the real and the digital worlds, we can use the digital world to help us solve the problems in the real one.
Iâ€™m looking forward to participating in #ClimateWeekNYC again this year and sharing how weâ€™re thinking about a sustainable future at Siemens USA. And Iâ€™m confident that this yearâ€™s event will move us forward even further.
What do you think are important priorities as we grapple with how to move faster in addressing #ClimateChange?",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"A sustainable future for our planet. Itâ€™s going to take a lot to get there, including innovative solutions to twin technological challenges: reducing and avoiding carbon emissions, and permanently removing gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere.
At McKinsey, we aspire to be the largest private-sector catalyst for decarbonization. Weâ€™re realizing this in measurable ways. In addition to our sustainability work with over 600 clients and our own progress as a firm toward reaching net zero by 2030, weâ€™ve invested more than $400 million in the last two years, including in our partnership with Frontier. Frontierâ€”which we helped found along with Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripeâ€”is a $1 billion advance market commitment to purchase permanent carbon removal by 2030. It aims to expand the global supply of carbon removal rather than increase competition for the supply that exists today. The program just announced its first set of direct air capture offtakes, totaling $47 million. Two climate innovators, CarbonCapture Inc. and Heirloom, will work to permanently remove 70,000 tons of COâ‚‚ from the atmosphere by 2030.

"#sustainability and ESG are as important as any Financial KPI's for a company to be successful in today's modern world-- I want to congratulate the entire #genesys team for the amazing success we have achieved since the launch of these formal efforts a few years ago.
Kudos and a big thank you to Bridgette McAdoo for your strong leadership!!!
Please feel free to read this years' report (link below); some notable highlights are as follows:
1. Improving from a Bronze to a Gold rating by EcoVadis in less than two years â€” this places Genesys in the top 5% of the more 100,000 companies assessed by the organization, and in the top 1% of those in the software provider industry.
2. Achieving LEED Platinum certifications for its new offices in Galway, Ireland; and Menlo Park, California. The establishment of LEED-certified buildings is a vital piece in addressing climate change, meeting Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals, enhancing resilience and support for our communities.
3. Genesys reports not only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also Scope 3 and has organically reduced its overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8% in the last year and nearly 25% over the last 2 years. This reduction was driven primarily by helping our customers on their Sustainability journeys by transitioning them from on-premise software solutions to the cloud. We have committed to setting science-based targets (SBTi) and becoming carbon neutral by 2030
4. We have committed to positively impact over 100 million experiences annually by supporting nonprofit charitable organizations by 2030. Last year we achieved over 46 million and and look forward to further supporting those in need for years into the future.
5. Genesys has committed to improve our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) to align with the communities in which we work. During the last year (1) underrepresented leadership (director and above) in the U.S. grew from 20.4% to 22.5%, (2) representation across all underrepresented groups in the U.S. workforce grew by greater than 13%, and (3) since officially establishing the DEI program in 2020, women in leadership across the globe increased by more than 20%.",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"In our increasingly complex world, we see increasing numbers of companies setting ambitious #ESG goals and targets for their operations and across their supply chains â€“ a crucial step in protecting our planet. While it is great to see that more companies are setting ambitious targets for themselves, we still lack reliable, comparable data across supply chains â€“ especially when it comes to #Scope3Emissions.
Realizing true #CarbonTransparency across entire value chains requires tight collaboration between stakeholders from industry, technology, and the public sector. Going forward, companies need to treat carbon like financial data. Thatâ€˜s why we at SAP are investing in our vision of a Green Ledger that will allow us to do exactly that.
I'm particularly proud of the work SAP has done with WBCSD â€“ World Business Council for Sustainable Development in publishing this paper on this important topic. It's a great summary of the challenge we face and how we can solve it.

"As we consider the worldâ€™s mounting challengesâ€”whether climate change, the debt crisis, or othersâ€”one truth remains: LMICs are getting squeezed on all sides. Thereâ€™s been quite a lot of talking about how to respond, but weâ€™ve yet to see the concrete steps needed to provide relief to the worldâ€™s most vulnerable people.
Itâ€™s vital that we not only acknowledge this shortfall but also renew our commitment to swift, collective action in times of crisis.

WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala announced the endorsement by standard setting bodies, international organizations, steel producers and industry associations of a set of principles aimed at aligning how greenhouse gas emissions are measured in the steel sector. Steel is a vital sector to decarbonise â€“ a $1TR sector forming the
spine of industry; contributing 8% of emissions, including 15-30% of those in a car, 25%+ in white goods and 70%+ in a wind farm; already a somewhat circular industry with less global heating potential than some of its alternatives; and with proven technologies to help.
We drew together CEOs from across the activity chain to discuss these standards, new steel-making technologies, the opportunities for miners to help decarbonize the full supply chain, CCUS technologies, transition finance, and the effects of all of this on steel economics and pricing.

"AXA , Allianz , Swiss Re and other major insurers laid out an industry blueprint for climate goals at Davos this week, detailing the role they intend to play in the #energytransition.
Whether clean or dirty, #infrastructure and #energy projects must obtain #insurance cover before they can get #credit from #banks, thrusting the operations of insurers, reinsurers and brokers into the spotlight.
The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a climate-focused industry club whose membersâ€™ portfolios account for 15 per cent of global premiums, has given insurers until July 2024 to choose at least three climate targets to report against annually.
Among their options: expanding the number of clients who have set science-based net zero goals; doing more underwriting business for weather-related damage, carbon removal technologies or clean energy; and moving away from the most polluting clients.
Insurers served as â€œsocietyâ€™s early warning systemâ€, and were on the â€œfront linesâ€ of climate change, given the annual disaster-related losses exceeding $100bn that they have had to cover in recent years.
The NZIA has been plagued with fears that collective action to boycott certain industries could amount to a breach of competition law, and resisted pressure last year to recommend its members stop insuring all new coal projects, citing competition law risks.
It has, to a large extent, been playing catch-up with other groupings in the umbrella body Carney founded, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banking and asset owners issued their own target-setting guidelines in 2021 or earlier.
Activists argue that what insurers have now come up with amounts to a â€œfrustrating step backwardsâ€, for three geeky reasons.
Firstly, one of the decarbonisation targets insurers can choose from calls for them to cut emissions such as carbon and methane by at least 34 per cent by 2030 â€” notably lower than the minimum 43 per cent cut that the UNâ€™s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is aligned with the Paris agreement.
Secondly, certain important types of insurance, such as construction risk, which would be needed to build oil and gas plants, are out of scope.
Finally, targets do not have to include the scope 3 emissions of insurersâ€™ clients â€” emissions related to their supply chains and the use of products â€” for many companies, the biggest part of their carbon footprint. This appears to be at odds with a UN standard laid out at COP27 for the integrity of net zero targets, as well as the UNâ€™s Race to Zero campaign. Both stipulate carbon accounting should include mandatory disclosure of indirect emissions.

"Climate and other environmental litigations are rising, bringing about new forms of financing of long, expensive and risky legal actions. Alongside traditional claimants - NGOs and community groups backed by donations, new types of investors emerge that provide funding for ESG-related litigations in return for a share of compensation proceeds.
As significant commercial interests are embedded in environmental litigations against companies, #ESG risk management should become a greater
priority for businesses of all types, requiring urgent steps to reduce their adverse environmental and social impacts, greenwashing and other conduct risks.

"A Successful Net Zero Transition Goes Beyond Carbon Metrics
Orsted, the Danish electricity utility, is hailed as the posterchild of the net zero transition. Orsted has lowered its carbon intensity and absolute emissions by over 80% since its decision to switch to renewables 14 years ago. Back in 2009, 85% of Orsted electricity was generated by burning coal and only 15% came from renewable sources. Today, 86% of the company energy comes from renewable sources.
Many people in this the ESG/Climate sector know Orsted, and its successful energy transition (from a carbon perspective). What it less known is the fact that Orsted did not only maintain its operating margins by switching to renewables, it has substantially improved its return on capital, almost doubled shareholder equity, and more than doubled earning per share (The tables I added to the chart below compares Orsted's financials in the low and high GHG emitting years). This part of the story is as much worth highlighting as the substantial decline in the company GHG emissions when citing Orsted transformation.
To me, a successful net zero transition canâ€™t only be measured by climate metrics, investors need to have confidence in the resulting financial metrics tied to the net zero transition. As of today, investors lack the tools to make such assessments, but as more companies successfully transition, the relationship between climate metrics and financial impacts will increasingly clarify within a multitude of sectors.
ESG data startups who can build tools to help with such comparative financial analytics between transitioning and non-transitioning companies will find plenty of eager customers.

"ðŸ”¬ðŸ“ˆ Rebalancing Capitalism or Delaying Real Progress? A Critical Examination of Impact Measurement and Valuation
ðŸ’¡ The guiding question of our symposium at this year's Academy of Management annual meeting was truly thought-provoking: ""Can measuring the impact of business on society and the planet lead to a more socially and environmentally-oriented style of capitalism?""
The goals of the session were the following:
ðŸŽ¯ Introducing participants to key issues related to impact measurement and valuation: Understanding and quantifying the effects businesses have on society and the environment is the first step towards making them ""actionable"" and thus towards building a more sustainable economy.
ðŸ” Critically examining the ethics and politics of impact measurement, valuation/""dollarization"" and its standardization: Recognizing the potential pitfalls and biases in the method development and implementation process is vital to ensuring fair and equitable practices that lead to meaningful numbers - and subsequently change.
ðŸ’¡ Envisioning new processes that work with or replace organizationsâ€™ desire for management via quantification: Exploring innovative approaches to impact measurement that align with organizational goals while validly accounting for their social and environmental externalities as well as their positive contributions.
We had a great panel including Judith Stroehle, Florian Berg, Witold Henisz, Andrew King and Henry Mintzberg, moderated by Nien-hÃª Hsieh. The discussions were eye-opening, and it was inspiring to witness the collective commitment to the joint goal of more transparent and sustainable business practices. ðŸ¤ðŸŒ±
ðŸ’ªðŸŒŽ Let's continue to work together to develop impact measurement practices which are rigorous and effective! What gets measured gets managed. At the same time, let us keep in mind that not everything that counts can be counted.

"Important new study from #whartonesg highlighting greenwashing remains more than an order of magnitide ahead of green investing in terms of AUM. Let's shine light on greenwash and investigate where, when and how ESG factors are material as well as where, when and how asset managers are taking short cuts or engaged in cheap talk and even deception.",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"Dear Fellow Faculty and Administrators,
The The ESG Initiative at the Wharton School is again hosting our Turner Impact Portfolio Challenge (TIPC). This is a free, nationwide program that gives graduate students experiential learning in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) portfolio construction.
TIPC is designed to equip graduate students with the knowledge and practical skills to design and execute 100% ESG and impact investing portfolios. The challenge was developed by the ESG Initiative at the Wharton School in response to both growing student interest in ESG and impact investing, and industry demand for practical impact experience for new hires.
Please share this opportunity with your students and encourage them to form a team. The process of submitting a team application is quick, and the form will remain open through October 8th. Teams that submit the top five portfolios will be invited to participate in the final competition on Whartonâ€™s campus in April 2024 to pitch live to a panel of industry judges.
