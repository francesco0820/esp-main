"With hashtag#COP28 underway, I wanted to share some insights from a conversation I recently had with Christiana Figueres for my latest podcast episode. Christiana is the former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change. In this episode, she talks about how embracing an optimistic mindset helped her lead the process that secured the Paris Agreement, and how she now applies this way of thinking to our current challenge: that we need to execute climate solutions much faster and at greater scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. ""Optimism,"" she said, ""is not the output. It's the input. It's the mindset. It is the focus of our attention and our conviction that we actually have everything that it takes to solve a problem.""
One reality is that we are behind. The other reality is that, with technology, we are ""way forward, way faster, than we ever thought possible."" I agree with Christiana that now is the moment to set these two realities side by side "" ""to see them in equal importance"" "" and get to work. Yes, we are behind. But we can still catch up and build a sustainable net-zero future. And I'm proud that, at COP 28, Siemens is in the Green Zone showcasing technology to make this possible.
After all, as Christiana said, if energy is driving 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy can also be 75 percent of the solution. hashtag#OptimisticOutlook",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"YY Rebalancing Capitalism or Delaying Real Progress? A Critical Examination of Impact Measurement and Valuation
Y The guiding question of our symposium at this year's Academy of Management annual meeting was truly thought-provoking: ""Can measuring the impact of business on society and the planet lead to a more socially and environmentally-oriented style of capitalism?""
The goals of the session were the following:
YZ  Introducing participants to key issues related to impact measurement and valuation: Understanding and quantifying the effects businesses have on society and the environment is the first step towards making them ""actionable"" and thus towards building a more sustainable economy.
Y Critically examining the ethics and politics of impact measurement, valuation/""dollarization"" and its standardization: Recognizing the potential pitfalls and biases in the method development and implementation process is vital to ensuring fair and equitable practices that lead to meaningful numbers - and subsequently change.
Y Envisioning new processes that work with or replace organizations' desire for management via quantification: Exploring innovative approaches to impact measurement that align with organizational goals while validly accounting for their social and environmental externalities as well as their positive contributions.
We had a great panel including Judith Stroehle, Florian Berg, Witold Henisz, Andrew King and Henry Mintzberg, moderated by Nien-hAa Hsieh. The discussions were eye-opening, and it was inspiring to witness the collective commitment to the joint goal of more transparent and sustainable business practices. YY
YaYZ Let's continue to work together to develop impact measurement practices which are rigorous and effective! What gets measured gets managed. At the same time, let us keep in mind that not everything that counts can be counted.
To put it in the words of Henry Mintzberg: ""I love numbers and I am highly suspicious!""
A big thank you also goes to my co-organizers Emma van den Terrell and Prof. Dr. Ali Aslan GA14mA14say.

On a positive note, investor sentiment recovered from the fourth quarter low, and expectations for improving capital market conditions over the next 12 months, also stood out. Our own findings, based on Marcus & Millichap's proprietary research and investor surveys, are consistent with the general theme of the Roundtable's report.

"Today is National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, a day to remember all who have been lost to this devastating epidemic and to increase awareness of this growing threat to all families. Fentanyl is now the #1 cause of death in the U.S. among adults younger than 45 years old. On June 1, this became more than a statistic to us when our 31-year-old son Connor died from fentanyl poisoning. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine. It is a legitimate pharmaceutical used as an anesthetic during surgery and as an analgesic for the treatment of breakthrough pain. However, because it is inexpensive to manufacture and highly addictive, Mexican drug cartels using Chinese supplied precursor chemicals are adding fentanyl to virtually all illicitly supplied drugs, including counterfeit prescription medicines. Sometimes users are aware they are taking fentanyl, but often they are not. Because of poor quality control, any one pill can include a lethal dose""thus the DEA's awareness campaign: ""One pill can kill.""
My son was recently married, had a successful career, was a leader of teams, with a large support group of loving family and friends, and he was a long-time sufferer of chronic pain stemming from sports injuries. He thought he was getting Oxycontin from someone he knew, but one of the pills was laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl that likely killed him instantly. Doctors, pilots, attorneys, teachers, teenagers, and others from all demographic and socioeconomic groups taking what they believe to be Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, or Adderall. Dying from fentanyl poisoning.
There are no easy answers, and it will get worse before it gets better. The addictive power and profit motive too great. It is a war being waged against us that is costing billions of dollars and killing some of our best and brightest. The only control most of us have over an uncontrollable situation is to be prepared to save someone's life. Nalaxone (Narcan) is a cheap and now widely available drug that can be easily administered to someone in distress or dying from any opioid overdose "" including fentanyl. It's a cheap, easy-to-use, miracle antidote. But you have to have it within reach. 911 is too late. Naloxone will soon be available OTC. Put one in your car, office, or briefcase/purse. Or all three. Think of it as like an AED, except smaller, cheaper, easier, and more effective. And something you are more likely to use, statistically. You may think there is no need to have one, that you don't know anybody at risk, but neither did I.
Given the rapid growth in opioid deaths, there are two groups of people in the U.S. now""those who know someone who has died from an opioid overdose and those who will. You can potentially save someone's life by being prepared""buy them some time to figure it out, get the help they need. And maybe spare another parent the excruciating pain of losing a child.",MISC

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for ""Bidenomics"". Unemployment hasn't been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Biden's team seems to have engineered the rare ""soft landing"" where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" "" the world's most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. America's greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Biden's leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on America's constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administration's policies. President Biden's appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook

"On Monday, March 6, Sylvia Lopez, who's a Care Manager at SCAN called a member I'll call MaryAnn.
MaryAnn was a new member. She is dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and so she recently enrolled in our Connections plan.
Sylvia thought she'd be doing a quick, routine health assessment.
Well, here's what Sylvia quickly learned:
"" MaryAnn is 81 years old.
"" She experiences forgetfulness and has uncontrolled pain in her ankles, knees and back. She's got other ailments including hypertension, and incontinence.
"" She fell out of her bed recently.
"" She can't really take care of herself anymore. She can't cook or clean her apartment.
"" MaryAnn also lives alone. Her daughter used to care for her, but her daughter passed away from COVID.
In addition, MaryAnn was hungry.
Remember, Sylvia called her on a Monday. MaryAnn hadn't had a meal since the preceding Friday.
She was signed up with Meals on Wheels, but the portions were small and her next delivery wasn't due until the next day.
MaryAnn couldn't go to the local supermarket. A taxi would cost her $20, and she didn't have the money, since she'd used it to take a taxi to her last doctor's appointment.
She had half a jar of peanut butter in her house, and she was rationing 2 tablespoons of peanut butter every 3-4 hours. 2 tablespoons. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. Imagine that.
So here's where Sylvia stepped in. First, she got her authorization for Chronic Condition meals so she'd have food right away.
Her independent living benefit wasn't due to kick in until April 1, but she was hungry, so the SCAN team didn't waste any time approving her for immediate food delivery.
Then, Sylvia called Meals on Wheels America to make sure the delivery would be made the next day.
She also explained to MaryAnn that as a SCAN member she had a transportation benefit, which she could use to get to the doctor and the supermarket.
And then, the next day, Sylvia called MaryAnn again. She made sure she she'd gotten her meals.
She went over how to arrange transportation.
She told her SCAN would be sending her extra meals for as long as she needed them.
In addition, she got MaryAnn incontinence supplies and a SCAN Personal Emergency Response System so she can call for help if she falls or if she needs medical help.
She also helped arrange for a caregiver to come to MaryAnn's home three times a week to assist her with personal care and homemaking.
At the end of Sylvia's and MaryAnn's call, MaryAnn told Sylvia she'd had a dream the night after they spoke. ""In the dream, an angel came to me,"" MaryAnn told Sylvia. ""And the angel was you.""
We often talk about models to address the needs of complex patients.
What we don't talk about is the incredible empathy, passion, and dedication required to serve these patients day-in, day-out.
Thank you, Sylvia!",MISC
