"#sustainability and ESG are as important as any Financial KPI's for a company to be successful in today's modern world-- I want to congratulate the entire #genesys team for the amazing success we have achieved since the launch of these formal efforts a few years ago.
Kudos and a big thank you to Bridgette McAdoo for your strong leadership!!!
Please feel free to read this years' report (link below); some notable highlights are as follows:
1. Improving from a Bronze to a Gold rating by EcoVadis in less than two years "" this places Genesys in the top 5% of the more 100,000 companies assessed by the organization, and in the top 1% of those in the software provider industry.
2. Achieving LEED Platinum certifications for its new offices in Galway, Ireland; and Menlo Park, California. The establishment of LEED-certified buildings is a vital piece in addressing climate change, meeting Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals, enhancing resilience and support for our communities.
3. Genesys reports not only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also Scope 3 and has organically reduced its overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8% in the last year and nearly 25% over the last 2 years. This reduction was driven primarily by helping our customers on their Sustainability journeys by transitioning them from on-premise software solutions to the cloud. We have committed to setting science-based targets (SBTi) and becoming carbon neutral by 2030
4. We have committed to positively impact over 100 million experiences annually by supporting nonprofit charitable organizations by 2030. Last year we achieved over 46 million and and look forward to further supporting those in need for years into the future.
5. Genesys has committed to improve our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) to align with the communities in which we work. During the last year (1) underrepresented leadership (director and above) in the U.S. grew from 20.4% to 22.5%, (2) representation across all underrepresented groups in the U.S. workforce grew by greater than 13%, and (3) since officially establishing the DEI program in 2020, women in leadership across the globe increased by more than 20%.",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"This is a critical moment in the effort to build a sustainable future, as many wonder if climate objectives such as the Paris Agreement can still be realized.
The opportunity is clear: technology has advanced far more rapidly than climate experts anticipated. But here's the challenge: achieving climate goals now requires us to apply these technologies much faster.
Siemens has accepted this challenge, and I had a chance to share our plan of action at last week's CECP CEO Investor Forum focused on climate change. I shared how the intention of our strong sustainability governance and ESG framework, DEGREE, is to increase the speed for achieving our own hashtag#NetZero commitments and helping customers to achieve theirs.
This was on the heels of Siemens reporting record earnings as we continue to accelerate our customers' digital and hashtag#sustainability transformations. Today, more than 90 percent of our global revenue comes from a portfolio that enables sustainability impact.
Customers deploying our technologies are able to reduce energy consumption; they're able to use fewer resources; they're able to advance decarbonization. But's it not just about using less; it's also about doing more.
The technologies advancing decarbonization also bolster productivity. They generate strong business results and improve operational performance. And our strategy to help customers combine the real and digital worlds now offers a path forward for increasing speed and scale. The more we work on real-world processes and things in the digital world, the sooner we will build a sustainable future.
The question I closed with is: What is the cost of doing nothing? As business leaders, we have to look at our business cases in a new light. We must realize there are very rational judgments to be made when it comes to decarbonization. These rational judgements will lead us to the right kind of action within our organizations.
But if we do not drive change fast enough, what are the future impacts to our businesses and to society? Acting now with what we have is better than waiting for a perfect solution that may or may not arrive in the future. And at Siemens, we see that this commitment to hashtag#decarbonization "" to accelerating action "" is not only a vital responsibility; it's really the basis for our future business growth. hashtag#CEOInvestorForum",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"AXA , Allianz , Swiss Re and other major insurers laid out an industry blueprint for climate goals at Davos this week, detailing the role they intend to play in the #energytransition.
Whether clean or dirty, #infrastructure and #energy projects must obtain #insurance cover before they can get #credit from #banks, thrusting the operations of insurers, reinsurers and brokers into the spotlight.
The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a climate-focused industry club whose members' portfolios account for 15 per cent of global premiums, has given insurers until July 2024 to choose at least three climate targets to report against annually.
Among their options: expanding the number of clients who have set science-based net zero goals; doing more underwriting business for weather-related damage, carbon removal technologies or clean energy; and moving away from the most polluting clients.
Insurers served as ""society's early warning system"", and were on the ""front lines"" of climate change, given the annual disaster-related losses exceeding $100bn that they have had to cover in recent years.
The NZIA has been plagued with fears that collective action to boycott certain industries could amount to a breach of competition law, and resisted pressure last year to recommend its members stop insuring all new coal projects, citing competition law risks.
It has, to a large extent, been playing catch-up with other groupings in the umbrella body Carney founded, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banking and asset owners issued their own target-setting guidelines in 2021 or earlier.
Activists argue that what insurers have now come up with amounts to a ""frustrating step backwards"", for three geeky reasons.
Firstly, one of the decarbonisation targets insurers can choose from calls for them to cut emissions such as carbon and methane by at least 34 per cent by 2030 "" notably lower than the minimum 43 per cent cut that the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is aligned with the Paris agreement.
Secondly, certain important types of insurance, such as construction risk, which would be needed to build oil and gas plants, are out of scope.
Finally, targets do not have to include the scope 3 emissions of insurers' clients "" emissions related to their supply chains and the use of products "" for many companies, the biggest part of their carbon footprint. This appears to be at odds with a UN standard laid out at COP27 for the integrity of net zero targets, as well as the UN's Race to Zero campaign. Both stipulate carbon accounting should include mandatory disclosure of indirect emissions.

Together they provided background and clarity on the currently polarized political debate on ESG as well as charting a path forward past peak anti-ESG by focusing on the hard work of incorporating ESG factors into investment valuations. The three panelists highlighted impressive efforts made by each of them and their organizations to incorporate the energy transition and reshoring trends into valuation models in Asia with a particular focus not just on risk but also the enormous investment opportunities of green technology.

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from ""pure merit.""
Usual arguments for ""pure merit"" include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measure""we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someone's resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to say""whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the land""we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone.

Going forward, companies need to treat carbon like financial data. That"" s why we at SAP are investing in our vision of a Green Ledger that will allow us to do exactly that.
I'm particularly proud of the work SAP has done with WBCSD "" World Business Council for Sustainable Development in publishing this paper on this important topic. It's a great summary of the challenge we face and how we can solve it.

"This week, I joined fellow health sector leaders at the Health Evolution Summit to discuss how we can safely leverage tech, digital tools, and personalization without compromising patient privacy to bring about much-needed, meaningful change to health care. I spoke about how a distributed data network platform model of care can resolve the seeming paradox for health systems of meeting patient expectations for personalized care while safeguarding sensitive data and protecting privacy resulting in improved outcomes for all.
These concepts can and should co-exist, but doing so requires health care's main players to come together in changing our approach and building a new platform model for health care. #HESummit23",Data privacy and cybersecurity

"""ESG, in essence, is a free market, organic and an investor driven movement to ask firms to disclose more information about the described factors associated with their future cash flows or cost of capital. Investors would be derelict of their fiduciary responsibility to their stakeholders if they did not consider the material factors when making an investment decision. Prohibiting consideration of material ESG factors simply interferes with the provision of data to make asset markets efficient at pricing these risks and returns. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that substantial losses will be incurred by the constituents of the states such as Texas where legislation that infringes on the public pension fund's freedom to invest have been passed in recent months.""

"A Successful Net Zero Transition Goes Beyond Carbon Metrics
Orsted, the Danish electricity utility, is hailed as the posterchild of the net zero transition. Orsted has lowered its carbon intensity and absolute emissions by over 80% since its decision to switch to renewables 14 years ago. Back in 2009, 85% of Orsted electricity was generated by burning coal and only 15% came from renewable sources. Today, 86% of the company energy comes from renewable sources.
Many people in this the ESG/Climate sector know Orsted, and its successful energy transition (from a carbon perspective). What it less known is the fact that Orsted did not only maintain its operating margins by switching to renewables, it has substantially improved its return on capital, almost doubled shareholder equity, and more than doubled earning per share (The tables I added to the chart below compares Orsted's financials in the low and high GHG emitting years). This part of the story is as much worth highlighting as the substantial decline in the company GHG emissions when citing Orsted transformation.
To me, a successful net zero transition can't only be measured by climate metrics, investors need to have confidence in the resulting financial metrics tied to the net zero transition. As of today, investors lack the tools to make such assessments, but as more companies successfully transition, the relationship between climate metrics and financial impacts will increasingly clarify within a multitude of sectors.
ESG data startups who can build tools to help with such comparative financial analytics between transitioning and non-transitioning companies will find plenty of eager customers.

Computing has thus far served as a source of information, a venue for productivity, and a home for entertainment. Yet, the role of computing is undergoing a fundamental shift. It is expanding into a new era where systems powered by AI will be imbued with autonomy and agency, assisting us across both knowledge-and physical-based tasks, and will become part of our ambient environment. We're in an era of global expansion where computing is underlying a more significant opportunity and better future for everyone.
Welcome to the Siliconomy.
The #Siliconomy represents a future enabled by the magic of silicon, where semiconductors are essential to everyday life. All sectors of the global economy, from healthcare to education to manufacturing, government, businesses, and more, are touched by it. A limitless, more sustainable, open, and more secure supply of processing power supports a thriving Siliconomy. Today silicon feeds a $574 billion industry, which in turn powers a global tech economy worth about $8 trillion.
We must work together to maintain a successful Siliconomy, supported by a more sustainable and highly secure supply of exceptionally engineered processing power delivered by globally balanced, resilient supply chains.

"The private sector, specifically financial institutions like Citi are playing a critical role in helping to scale low-carbon solutions. That's one of the themes I discussed with Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson from Financial Times and Chloe Demrovsky from DRI International at this week's The Paley Center for Media International Council Summit. It was an honest conversation about the challenges of climate change and how to catalyze opportunities created by the energy transition.
