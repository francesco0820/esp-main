"This week, I joined fellow health sector leaders at the Health Evolution Summit to discuss how we can safely leverage tech, digital tools, and personalization without compromising patient privacy to bring about much-needed, meaningful change to health care. I spoke about how a distributed data network platform model of care can resolve the seeming paradox for health systems of meeting patient expectations for personalized care while safeguarding sensitive data and protecting privacy resulting in improved outcomes for all.
These concepts can and should co-exist, but doing so requires health care's main players to come together in changing our approach and building a new platform model for health care. #HESummit23",Data privacy and cybersecurity

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from ""pure merit.""
Usual arguments for ""pure merit"" include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measure""we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someone's resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to say""whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the land""we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for ""Bidenomics"". Unemployment hasn't been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Biden's team seems to have engineered the rare ""soft landing"" where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" "" the world's most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. America's greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Biden's leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on America's constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administration's policies. President Biden's appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook
"The Real Estate Roundtable, a great industry organization focused on education and information sharing, recently published its Q1 2023 Sentiment Survey. As expected, uncertainty around price discovery, future interest rates and recession risk remain primary concerns, which in turn is leading to larger bid-ask spreads and hindered CRE trading volumes. On a positive note, investor sentiment recovered from the fourth quarter low, and expectations for improving capital market conditions over the next 12 months, also stood out. Our own findings, based on Marcus & Millichap's proprietary research and investor surveys, are consistent with the general theme of the Roundtable's report. Importantly, we reiterate as does the report, that generalizations by property type and/or market, can result in missed investment opportunities.

This was my second time at the event, and I left feeling even more inspired than last year. Why? In three words: resilience, collaboration, and courage.

What does this take? One thing is agility, the ability to act and react quickly without stumbling. Another is balance, the notion that you're managing for near-term performance without losing sight of long-term potential.
Lastly, it takes real courage. The courage to be decisive and move fast amid persistent headwinds. Leaders in Arendal exemplified these qualities. I aspire to do the same. You can learn more about building a resilience agenda here: https://lnkd.in/gnnsaE2P

Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy.

"Today is National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, a day to remember all who have been lost to this devastating epidemic and to increase awareness of this growing threat to all families. Fentanyl is now the #1 cause of death in the U.S. among adults younger than 45 years old. On June 1, this became more than a statistic to us when our 31-year-old son Connor died from fentanyl poisoning. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine. It is a legitimate pharmaceutical used as an anesthetic during surgery and as an analgesic for the treatment of breakthrough pain. However, because it is inexpensive to manufacture and highly addictive, Mexican drug cartels using Chinese supplied precursor chemicals are adding fentanyl to virtually all illicitly supplied drugs, including counterfeit prescription medicines. Sometimes users are aware they are taking fentanyl, but often they are not. Because of poor quality control, any one pill can include a lethal dose""thus the DEA's awareness campaign: ""One pill can kill.""
My son was recently married, had a successful career, was a leader of teams, with a large support group of loving family and friends, and he was a long-time sufferer of chronic pain stemming from sports injuries. He thought he was getting Oxycontin from someone he knew, but one of the pills was laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl that likely killed him instantly. Doctors, pilots, attorneys, teachers, teenagers, and others from all demographic and socioeconomic groups taking what they believe to be Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, or Adderall. Dying from fentanyl poisoning.
There are no easy answers, and it will get worse before it gets better. The addictive power and profit motive too great. It is a war being waged against us that is costing billions of dollars and killing some of our best and brightest. The only control most of us have over an uncontrollable situation is to be prepared to save someone's life. Nalaxone (Narcan) is a cheap and now widely available drug that can be easily administered to someone in distress or dying from any opioid overdose "" including fentanyl. It's a cheap, easy-to-use, miracle antidote. But you have to have it within reach. 911 is too late. Naloxone will soon be available OTC. Put one in your car, office, or briefcase/purse. Or all three. Think of it as like an AED, except smaller, cheaper, easier, and more effective. And something you are more likely to use, statistically. You may think there is no need to have one, that you don't know anybody at risk, but neither did I.
Given the rapid growth in opioid deaths, there are two groups of people in the U.S. now""those who know someone who has died from an opioid overdose and those who will. You can potentially save someone's life by being prepared""buy them some time to figure it out, get the help they need. And maybe spare another parent the excruciating pain of losing a child.",MISC

This model is an important contribution to healthcare's #AgeFriendly movement. It offers a standard approach to dementia care, including 24/7 access to a support line as well as caregiver training, education, and support services. Knowing that dementia imposes significant financial, emotional, and logistical burdens on families that are often exacerbated for certain racial and ethnic groups, the GUIDE model was designed to reduce disparities in access to dementia services, and it incorporates policies to advance #HealthEquity.
This Fall, CMMI will issue an RFA to help test the GUIDE model and alternative payment for organizations that deliver supportive services to people with dementia. Organizations that provide care to underserved communities are encouraged to apply. A variety of financial and technical supports will be available to ensure that participating safety-net providers can develop their infrastructure, improve their care delivery capabilities, and participate successfully in the model. Until the RFA is issued, interested folks can submit to CMS a Letter of Intent by September 15. I'm looking forward to following the impact of this work!

"On Monday, March 6, Sylvia Lopez, who's a Care Manager at SCAN called a member I'll call MaryAnn.
MaryAnn was a new member. She is dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and so she recently enrolled in our Connections plan.
Sylvia thought she'd be doing a quick, routine health assessment.
Well, here's what Sylvia quickly learned:
"" MaryAnn is 81 years old.
"" She experiences forgetfulness and has uncontrolled pain in her ankles, knees and back. She's got other ailments including hypertension, and incontinence.
"" She fell out of her bed recently.
"" She can't really take care of herself anymore. She can't cook or clean her apartment.
"" MaryAnn also lives alone. Her daughter used to care for her, but her daughter passed away from COVID.
In addition, MaryAnn was hungry.
Remember, Sylvia called her on a Monday. MaryAnn hadn't had a meal since the preceding Friday.
She was signed up with Meals on Wheels, but the portions were small and her next delivery wasn't due until the next day.
MaryAnn couldn't go to the local supermarket. A taxi would cost her $20, and she didn't have the money, since she'd used it to take a taxi to her last doctor's appointment.
She had half a jar of peanut butter in her house, and she was rationing 2 tablespoons of peanut butter every 3-4 hours. 2 tablespoons. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. Imagine that.
So here's where Sylvia stepped in. First, she got her authorization for Chronic Condition meals so she'd have food right away.
Her independent living benefit wasn't due to kick in until April 1, but she was hungry, so the SCAN team didn't waste any time approving her for immediate food delivery.
Then, Sylvia called Meals on Wheels America to make sure the delivery would be made the next day.
She also explained to MaryAnn that as a SCAN member she had a transportation benefit, which she could use to get to the doctor and the supermarket.
And then, the next day, Sylvia called MaryAnn again. She made sure she she'd gotten her meals.
She went over how to arrange transportation.
She told her SCAN would be sending her extra meals for as long as she needed them.
In addition, she got MaryAnn incontinence supplies and a SCAN Personal Emergency Response System so she can call for help if she falls or if she needs medical help.
She also helped arrange for a caregiver to come to MaryAnn's home three times a week to assist her with personal care and homemaking.
At the end of Sylvia's and MaryAnn's call, MaryAnn told Sylvia she'd had a dream the night after they spoke. ""In the dream, an angel came to me,"" MaryAnn told Sylvia. ""And the angel was you.""
We often talk about models to address the needs of complex patients.
What we don't talk about is the incredible empathy, passion, and dedication required to serve these patients day-in, day-out.
Thank you, Sylvia!",MISC

"With hashtag#COP28 underway, I wanted to share some insights from a conversation I recently had with Christiana Figueres for my latest podcast episode. Christiana is the former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change. In this episode, she talks about how embracing an optimistic mindset helped her lead the process that secured the Paris Agreement, and how she now applies this way of thinking to our current challenge: that we need to execute climate solutions much faster and at greater scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. ""Optimism,"" she said, ""is not the output. It's the input. It's the mindset. It is the focus of our attention and our conviction that we actually have everything that it takes to solve a problem.""
One reality is that we are behind. The other reality is that, with technology, we are ""way forward, way faster, than we ever thought possible."" I agree with Christiana that now is the moment to set these two realities side by side "" ""to see them in equal importance"" "" and get to work. Yes, we are behind. But we can still catch up and build a sustainable net-zero future. And I'm proud that, at COP 28, Siemens is in the Green Zone showcasing technology to make this possible.
After all, as Christiana said, if energy is driving 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy can also be 75 percent of the solution. hashtag#OptimisticOutlook",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"This is a critical moment in the effort to build a sustainable future, as many wonder if climate objectives such as the Paris Agreement can still be realized.
The opportunity is clear: technology has advanced far more rapidly than climate experts anticipated. But here's the challenge: achieving climate goals now requires us to apply these technologies much faster.
Siemens has accepted this challenge, and I had a chance to share our plan of action at last week's CECP CEO Investor Forum focused on climate change. I shared how the intention of our strong sustainability governance and ESG framework, DEGREE, is to increase the speed for achieving our own hashtag#NetZero commitments and helping customers to achieve theirs.
This was on the heels of Siemens reporting record earnings as we continue to accelerate our customers' digital and hashtag#sustainability transformations. Today, more than 90 percent of our global revenue comes from a portfolio that enables sustainability impact.
Customers deploying our technologies are able to reduce energy consumption; they're able to use fewer resources; they're able to advance decarbonization. But's it not just about using less; it's also about doing more.
The technologies advancing decarbonization also bolster productivity. They generate strong business results and improve operational performance. And our strategy to help customers combine the real and digital worlds now offers a path forward for increasing speed and scale. The more we work on real-world processes and things in the digital world, the sooner we will build a sustainable future.
The question I closed with is: What is the cost of doing nothing? As business leaders, we have to look at our business cases in a new light. We must realize there are very rational judgments to be made when it comes to decarbonization. These rational judgements will lead us to the right kind of action within our organizations.
But if we do not drive change fast enough, what are the future impacts to our businesses and to society? Acting now with what we have is better than waiting for a perfect solution that may or may not arrive in the future. And at Siemens, we see that this commitment to hashtag#decarbonization "" to accelerating action "" is not only a vital responsibility; it's really the basis for our future business growth. hashtag#CEOInvestorForum",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

2. Digitalization is a powerful ally on the path to #NetZero. In bringing together the real and the digital worlds, we can use the digital world to help us solve the problems in the real one.
I'm looking forward to participating in #ClimateWeekNYC again this year and sharing how we're thinking about a sustainable future at Siemens USA. And I'm confident that this year's event will move us forward even further.

1. Improving from a Bronze to a Gold rating by EcoVadis in less than two years "" this places Genesys in the top 5% of the more 100,000 companies assessed by the organization, and in the top 1% of those in the software provider industry.
2. Achieving LEED Platinum certifications for its new offices in Galway, Ireland; and Menlo Park, California. The establishment of LEED-certified buildings is a vital piece in addressing climate change, meeting Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals, enhancing resilience and support for our communities.
3. Genesys reports not only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also Scope 3 and has organically reduced its overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8% in the last year and nearly 25% over the last 2 years. This reduction was driven primarily by helping our customers on their Sustainability journeys by transitioning them from on-premise software solutions to the cloud. We have committed to setting science-based targets (SBTi) and becoming carbon neutral by 2030
4. We have committed to positively impact over 100 million experiences annually by supporting nonprofit charitable organizations by 2030. Last year we achieved over 46 million and and look forward to further supporting those in need for years into the future.
5. Genesys has committed to improve our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) to align with the communities in which we work. During the last year (1) underrepresented leadership (director and above) in the U.S. grew from 20.4% to 22.5%, (2) representation across all underrepresented groups in the U.S. workforce grew by greater than 13%, and (3) since officially establishing the DEI program in 2020, women in leadership across the globe increased by more than 20%.",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"AXA , Allianz , Swiss Re and other major insurers laid out an industry blueprint for climate goals at Davos this week, detailing the role they intend to play in the #energytransition.
Whether clean or dirty, #infrastructure and #energy projects must obtain #insurance cover before they can get #credit from #banks, thrusting the operations of insurers, reinsurers and brokers into the spotlight.
The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a climate-focused industry club whose members' portfolios account for 15 per cent of global premiums, has given insurers until July 2024 to choose at least three climate targets to report against annually.
Among their options: expanding the number of clients who have set science-based net zero goals; doing more underwriting business for weather-related damage, carbon removal technologies or clean energy; and moving away from the most polluting clients.
Insurers served as ""society's early warning system"", and were on the ""front lines"" of climate change, given the annual disaster-related losses exceeding $100bn that they have had to cover in recent years.
The NZIA has been plagued with fears that collective action to boycott certain industries could amount to a breach of competition law, and resisted pressure last year to recommend its members stop insuring all new coal projects, citing competition law risks.
It has, to a large extent, been playing catch-up with other groupings in the umbrella body Carney founded, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banking and asset owners issued their own target-setting guidelines in 2021 or earlier.
Activists argue that what insurers have now come up with amounts to a ""frustrating step backwards"", for three geeky reasons.
Firstly, one of the decarbonisation targets insurers can choose from calls for them to cut emissions such as carbon and methane by at least 34 per cent by 2030 "" notably lower than the minimum 43 per cent cut that the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is aligned with the Paris agreement.
Secondly, certain important types of insurance, such as construction risk, which would be needed to build oil and gas plants, are out of scope.
Finally, targets do not have to include the scope 3 emissions of insurers' clients "" emissions related to their supply chains and the use of products "" for many companies, the biggest part of their carbon footprint. This appears to be at odds with a UN standard laid out at COP27 for the integrity of net zero targets, as well as the UN's Race to Zero campaign. Both stipulate carbon accounting should include mandatory disclosure of indirect emissions.

"A Successful Net Zero Transition Goes Beyond Carbon Metrics
Orsted, the Danish electricity utility, is hailed as the posterchild of the net zero transition. Orsted has lowered its carbon intensity and absolute emissions by over 80% since its decision to switch to renewables 14 years ago. Back in 2009, 85% of Orsted electricity was generated by burning coal and only 15% came from renewable sources. Today, 86% of the company energy comes from renewable sources.
Many people in this the ESG/Climate sector know Orsted, and its successful energy transition (from a carbon perspective). What it less known is the fact that Orsted did not only maintain its operating margins by switching to renewables, it has substantially improved its return on capital, almost doubled shareholder equity, and more than doubled earning per share (The tables I added to the chart below compares Orsted's financials in the low and high GHG emitting years). This part of the story is as much worth highlighting as the substantial decline in the company GHG emissions when citing Orsted transformation.
To me, a successful net zero transition can't only be measured by climate metrics, investors need to have confidence in the resulting financial metrics tied to the net zero transition. As of today, investors lack the tools to make such assessments, but as more companies successfully transition, the relationship between climate metrics and financial impacts will increasingly clarify within a multitude of sectors.
ESG data startups who can build tools to help with such comparative financial analytics between transitioning and non-transitioning companies will find plenty of eager customers.

Prohibiting consideration of material ESG factors simply interferes with the provision of data to make asset markets efficient at pricing these risks and returns.

The survey found that three quarters (74%) of professionals are already integrating ESG considerations as part of their M&A agenda, with the identification of ESG risks and opportunities given as the top reason for conducting ESG due diligence, by 46% of respondents, followed by requirements by investors, cited by 19%, and preparation for regulatory requirements by 14%

"YY Rebalancing Capitalism or Delaying Real Progress? A Critical Examination of Impact Measurement and Valuation
Y The guiding question of our symposium at this year's Academy of Management annual meeting was truly thought-provoking: ""Can measuring the impact of business on society and the planet lead to a more socially and environmentally-oriented style of capitalism?""
The goals of the session were the following:
YZ  Introducing participants to key issues related to impact measurement and valuation: Understanding and quantifying the effects businesses have on society and the environment is the first step towards making them ""actionable"" and thus towards building a more sustainable economy.
Y Critically examining the ethics and politics of impact measurement, valuation/""dollarization"" and its standardization: Recognizing the potential pitfalls and biases in the method development and implementation process is vital to ensuring fair and equitable practices that lead to meaningful numbers - and subsequently change.
Y Envisioning new processes that work with or replace organizations' desire for management via quantification: Exploring innovative approaches to impact measurement that align with organizational goals while validly accounting for their social and environmental externalities as well as their positive contributions.
We had a great panel including Judith Stroehle, Florian Berg, Witold Henisz, Andrew King and Henry Mintzberg, moderated by Nien-hAa Hsieh. The discussions were eye-opening, and it was inspiring to witness the collective commitment to the joint goal of more transparent and sustainable business practices. YY
YaYZ Let's continue to work together to develop impact measurement practices which are rigorous and effective! What gets measured gets managed. At the same time, let us keep in mind that not everything that counts can be counted.
To put it in the words of Henry Mintzberg: ""I love numbers and I am highly suspicious!""
A big thank you also goes to my co-organizers Emma van den Terrell and Prof. Dr. Ali Aslan GA14mA14say.

"Important new study from #whartonesg highlighting greenwashing remains more than an order of magnitide ahead of green investing in terms of AUM. Let's shine light on greenwash and investigate where, when and how ESG factors are material as well as where, when and how asset managers are taking short cuts or engaged in cheap talk and even deception.",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"Dear Fellow Faculty and Administrators,
The The ESG Initiative at the Wharton School is again hosting our Turner Impact Portfolio Challenge (TIPC). This is a free, nationwide program that gives graduate students experiential learning in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) portfolio construction.
TIPC is designed to equip graduate students with the knowledge and practical skills to design and execute 100% ESG and impact investing portfolios. The challenge was developed by the ESG Initiative at the Wharton School in response to both growing student interest in ESG and impact investing, and industry demand for practical impact experience for new hires.
Please share this opportunity with your students and encourage them to form a team. The process of submitting a team application is quick, and the form will remain open through October 8th. Teams that submit the top five portfolios will be invited to participate in the final competition on Wharton's campus in April 2024 to pitch live to a panel of industry judges.
