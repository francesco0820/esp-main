Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

A call for courageous leaders who get into the details in all the right ways, empower teams, and have the potential to improve our organizations. Agency, connecting with customers, seeing the impact of our work. Focusing on outcomes instead of outputs. The potential of AI. All of these things speak to purpose, hope, possibilities, and opportunities. They talk about fulfillment, career enhancement, and purpose.The Reality (For Many) ” Multiple rounds of layoffs (amidst record profits). Truly hurtful hiring practices (""Oh whoops, we've decided to restructure, offer rescinded, thanks for the 3hr assignment""). Thoughtless RTO mandates. Same old corporate doublespeak in all companies”startups, 100y  enterprises, and everything in between. Tech CEOs are saying dumb, insensitive things that are so predictably biased that it hurts to listen. Gaslighting is in full effect.A rapidly declining sense of loyalty in companies. We're still working through the trauma of the pandemic. The climate change news is terrifying. Global conflict. A reported epidemic of loneliness (here in the US).We're bombarded by a full range of perspectives on AI, from blind AI fan-boy enthusiasm all the way to complete Luddism and genuine fear for jobs and everything in between.

Discuss how roles will change or not change. -Urge people to adapt their skills and encourage companies to transform.They are all doing what people do for the most part, which is trying to help in their own way. But sometimes it isn't landing. There's a deluge of coping advice.My realization ” People are tired. People feel in limbo. People are questioning themselves, their companies, and their craft. It's not the rate of change that is truly gripping people, it is the tension of the change.It is crucial to be empathetic, sensitive, and helpful in genuine ways. Our default ways of helping may not even be helpful right now, so it's important to be super self-aware. We all need someone to listen and not lecture.I've written, taught, spoken, and drawn infographics for many years about good products, high-performing teams, feature factories, and continuous improvement.

The technology could get the airline 10ppt extra utilization across its entire network (worth over $100M per year in bottom line) but they could not get to that value until they got airport palletizing procedures to be optimized and cargo sales reps to use the technology in their day to day workflow. Both critical non-tech changes.For real value, it's #NeverJustTech - There is so much more to consider in order to maximize the performance of digital and AI solutions. Every time a new solutions gets introduced to optimize a process or a customer experience, there will likely be changes required upstream and downstream of that process as per my airline example. That's why business leaders must own the reimagination of that business process with technology AND also own the change management. It's also why such efforts are so often failing if they are tucked too low in the organization with managers who don't own the end-to-end process or if they are being pushed by IT. #McKinseyDigital #RewiredBook","Organizational Change Management,AI/Machine Learning,Digital Transformation",,video,,Frederico,Padliha,Capital One,Banking,Head of Strategy for Enterprise Product and Experience,75,4,3,2d,,,,Frederico Padilha likes this,Likes,,2024-04-23 01:18,4/23/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,1:18 AM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/3fbb18c6-fb75-41e2-876e-a9a1a8583948,,,,,,,,checked,,82,Engagement,1am-2am,April 2024,

This will include regular huddles and direct communication between physicians, APP’s and the support teams.  Technology will be and enabler of huddles and relationship building.

→ you force B2B buyers down the funnel before they’re ready to buy
→ you’re not aligned with how buyers want to buy 
→ you damage your brand
→ you lose delas

But in reality, the B2B buying process is complex and looks like a maze. 

And you need to:

→ Deliver value through multiple touchpoints
 
Because it’s the accumulation of touchpoints over time that drives your buyers to take action.

→ Give them the time they need to make buying decisions 

Because it takes time for B2B buyers to:

1- Become problem aware
2- Prioritize solving this problem
3- Become category/solution aware
4- Ensure the buying committee is on board
5- Allocate a budget to solve this problem
6- Choose your brand & buy

→ Understand how they prioritize problems, and research & evaluate solutions 

Because it’s the foundation of how you do marketing, unless you want assumption-led growth. Making customer research a priority is no longer optional.


So when you figure out all of this and adapt your GTM strategy accordingly, you’ll attract your ideal customer.

The energy and passion of our colleagues there was truly inspiring. Here are some of the highlights and learnings from our trip:

> We had an excellent Town Hall with the entire IT Community in Mexico, where we introduced the entire US&I LT and discussed the strategic direction and priorities of our function, as well as the opportunities and challenges we face in the US market. We held an open Q&A session where I was impressed by the enthusiasm, engagement, and professionalism of our colleagues, and their continued desire to focus on the US business and grow the talent across all IT functions. 
> We strategized as a team on our refined Ways of Working, including improved KPIs and leveraging the feedback from our extended team to improve how we show up as a part of the larger DD&IT organization. We also had an opportunity to meet with the ITLT on the ground, and addressed their questions on how we deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. 
> We had the opportunity to meet with our individual team members in Mexico face-to-face and discuss individual team priorities.
> We worked with our various P&O colleagues on topics such as attracting and retaining talent in the NOCC as well as advancing our interactions as a team, with a focus on enhancing our collaboration and communication skills. 
> We also had some fun and bonding activities, such as a cultural tour of the city where we immersed in the wonderful Mexican Culture. 

I want to thank everyone who made this trip possible and successful, especially our hosts Juan Antonio Rosario, Giorgio Diaz and Tania Del Villar Orozco and of course Rodrigo Reygadas the NOCC site head in Mexico, who were very gracious and hospitable. I also want to thank my leadership team for their dedication, commitment, and passion for our function. I am proud to be part of such a diverse and talented group of leaders, and I look forward to continuing our journey together.

🔹 Attracting and investing in the next generation of engineers is imperative for the industry as a whole to do better, faster.

🔹 While the industry transformations that will come as part of the #energytransition may be challenging, they also represent an enormous opportunity for those companies able to take advantage of them to remake industries for a sustainable future.

Every experience brings different learning. But when your growth has been defined by job title, level, promotions and status, moving to a newly formed, flat organisation with high growth ambitions can be confusing. It can be difficult to recognise growth without tangible symbols, and the workload, urgency and ambiguity can be overwhelming. 

At TBG we wanted to create an event to explore what is different about this type of experience - and how we can make the most of it whilst building understanding of what skills and experiences we are adding to our toolkit.  Last Thursday we hosted a morning of activities - including an insightful panel discussion featuring Russell Kronenburg, Malcolm Devine and Isabelle Ehrmantraut, interactive workshops to explore trust, feedback and reframing and an overview of how we will enable people growth as the business grows. It was a brilliant opportunity to step back and take stock of how far we have come and the road ahead. 

A massive thank you to everyone who got involved - especially the brilliant team of volunteers from across our team who put their hearts and heads into the event. You really brought this to life.

🔹 Asset-intensive industries are undergoing profound transformation, and companies must keep pace in order to remain competitive.

🔹 Attracting and investing in the next generation of engineers is imperative for the industry as a whole to do better, faster.

🔹 While the industry transformations that will come as part of the #energytransition may be challenging, they also represent an enormous opportunity for those companies able to take advantage of them to remake industries for a sustainable future.

The cohort is equivalent to a graduate level class, but oriented towards spending time immersing themselves in the following areas:

- Data Analysis (for 2 months)
- Data Visualization 
- How to work with Healthcare Data 
- Understanding aspects of Healthcare Operations
- Understanding frameworks and application of Process Improvement

Excited to immerse myself in the industry I love with a well experienced cohort of caregivers, operational leaders and analytics developers. Excited to share thoughts, but more excited to learn from and with these team members. This is one of many steps ahead of us in the development of our enterprise data academy and data fluency education & training programs journey. Finally, shout out to our partners Maddie Banas & Desiree Winters for their dedication to the advancement of this program and impact on our broader care continuum.

Can't wait to share some of our lessons learned, but more excited about another advancement on this pillar of our enterprise data & analytics journey  in coming weeks. 

Be sure to stay tune!

It creates a deep understanding of the challenge…  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders’ minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders… how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent… how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within… saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

It’s all about the C-suite—until it isn’t.
 
That’s the big finding in our brand-new original research, conducted with support from the Ford Foundation Mission Investments team.
 
Conventional wisdom is that, as a strategy to maximize enterprise value, large PE firms focus human capital management efforts at the top of the org chart—and our research validated that. 

But as we dug deeper, we kept hearing, “Well, there was this one deal….”

We studied 7 large (AUM >$5B) private equity firms, including BlackRock Impact Opportunities Fund and TPG, and found that when lower-level workers play a *clear* and essential role in executing the value creation strategy for a particular deal, large private equity firms will dedicate resources to the bottom of the org chart. And when they do, they get better business results. 

Check out our report for snapshots from the front line in PE deals.
 
Done right, research leads to new questions—these are ours:

► What are the missed opportunities for value creation when deal teams don’t engage the bottom of the org chart? 
► Do PE deal teams have what they need to leverage human capital below the C-suite to drive enterprise value? 
 
WORC (Workforce & Organizational Research Center) is grateful to all the fund managers, human capital operating partners, investment team members, and others who were so generous with their time and insights. 

A huge thanks to Margot Brandenburg and Abeda Iqbal for their encouragement and thought partnership throughout.

Safety is our first value and top priority, and this week, our AES Utilities in Indiana and Ohio paused and reflected on our Safety legacy to inform how we can execute our work for the future. The AES Utilities use technology and innovation to improve safety practices, which enables us to reliably serve our customers and communities.

At AES Indiana, we recognized the AES Indiana team at Eagle Valley Generating Station on their significant efforts to improve their safety performance through implementing emergency management, designing an outstanding training program, and performing effective audits. In Ohio, we recognized the tireless efforts of AES Ohio crews and contractors for their restoration efforts earlier this spring when storms impacted more than 36,000 customers across the 24-county service territory. In moments like this, we know our customers look to us to get power restored as quickly as possible, and it’s our responsibility to do this as safely as possible. At AES El Salvador, the immense potential of technology allows us to streamline and make our processes safer, such as using drones for inspecting our distribution grids and applying AI and machine learning to predict and detect unauthorized residential electrical connections.

This week reaffirmed our commitment to employee, contractor and public safety and the commitment we have to each other to ensure each one of us returns home safely at the end of every day, and that is made possible by the hard work and agility of every person who is part of our AES Utilities Team.

Change is on my mind lately in different actual sales cycles, circumstances, combinations and permutations as I am getting more heavily involved in AI, ML and ML Ops. 

If you think about AI as a definitive enabling disruption of our time, change management should be top of mind and a priority consideration.

Last week, I managed to visit Workz A/S (a premiere Change Management company) in Copenhagen and through the kindness of my good friend Edoardo Montenegro, I was able to learn more about change management by actually playing one of their very popular strategy board games called hashtag #WallBreakers. This game is a simulation of a merger and acquisition situation of 2 tech companies navigating the difficult task of change, post merger. Thank you also Ask Agger.

5 IMPORTANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Change is hard and complex. Know the WHYs of the change.
2. Sequence and speed of change matters. 
3. Know the players and catalysts of change. 
4. You cannot force change but you can manage & empower it. 
 Start with small strategic wins.
5. Get professional help and an actual playbook.

As I like numbers, I am appreciative of thought leaders like Greg Satell who also writes about change and recently wrote about how a minority in an organisation 25% can be a tipping point number to actually effect organizational change (actual article in the comments below).

AI will be part of every organisation. If you don't have a game plan change management strategy, you will likely have a lot of challenges. 

If you are all in AI instead of just experimenting and ""tinkering"", think about the strategy and how to win over the 25% as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

As change management is a ""human-centered"" practice, we have to really lean into the human side even if the intervention is enabling technology.''

As I arrive in the final weeks of my AMA presidency – a year on the road, a year meeting with physicians, a year of seeing and hearing about the challenges facing our health system – I see a system in crisis. The Change Healthcare cyberattack and ensuing reimbursement challenges could not have come at a worse time. 
 
But we are years – and a confluence of preventable events – into what’s made it the worst possible time. 
 
Physicians have known for some time that our Medicare payment system that reimburses physicians for the care we provide was failing – and this was creating severe financial stress for physicians in private practice, which are the backbone of our health care safety net, particularly in rural and underserved communities.
 
When you adjust for inflation, the payment rate to physicians who care for Medicare patients has dropped 29% since my first year of medical school in 2001!
 
Then there’s burnout, driven by onerous burdens like prior authorization. Consider that roughly two in three doctors admitted to experiencing burnout during the pandemic, according to a survey from the AMA, the Mayo Clinic and Stanford University School of Medicine. That’s the highest level of burnout ever recorded by the AMA!

Consider that 1 in 5 physicians surveyed during the pandemic said they planned to leave medicine within the next 2 years, while 1 in 3 said they’d cut back on their hours.

Consider that nearly half of all practicing physicians in the U.S. today are over age 55.

Consider that foreign-trained physicians, called International Medical Graduates or IMGs, face enormous obstacles—such as immigration and green-card delays—to practice medicine in the U.S.
 
Consider that the average young doctor now leaves medical school more than $250,000 in debt, and that this heavy debt load has huge implications for our health system, often forcing aspiring physicians to bypass primary care and less populated, rural areas in favor of more lucrative specialties in or near large cities.
 
This is not sustainable. And I worry that health outcomes across the country will continue to decline unless we take the necessary steps today to bolster our physician workforce, reform our broken Medicare payment system, and create a sustainable model for health care that ensures access to care for all who need it – urban and rural alike.
 
So we must continue our quest to: 
·       Maintain payment for digital health tools that work
·       Fix prior authorization to reduce delays for pts
·       Reduce physician burnout 
·       Address the stigma around mental health
·       Reform Medicare payment to support seniors

It’s time to rebuild, and the AMA is ready.",Organizational Change Management,,video,,Stacy,Lloyd,American Medical Association,Healthcare Providers,"Director, Digital Health & Operations",297,28,24,1w,,,,Stacy Lloyd celebrates this,Celebrates,,2024-05-21 16:32,5/21/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,4:32 PM,,,,,,,,,,,349,Engagement,4pm-5pm,May 2024,checked

A seamless #SupplyChain is key to our mission to deliver everyday moments of care when people need them most. And there are so many behind-the-scenes links that make up this supply chain. It starts with our trusted suppliers.
