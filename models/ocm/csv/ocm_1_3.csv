👨‍💻 Choosing a certain vendor may not be just because of their technology but also price, accessibility, EHR integration, and other secondary factors 

👍 Prioritization is overrated - focus on solving many problems at the same time in order to try out different solutions in different environments

"This week I was honored to testify before congress on the vital issue of â€œSecuring the Federal Software Supply Chain,â€ joined by prominent policy and association leaders James Lewis, Jamil Jaffer, and Roger Waldron, in a Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation subcommittee hearing chaired by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). I commend Chairwoman Mace and Ranking Member Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who continue to press for heightened federal supply chain resilience following high-profile hacks by threat actors â€“ including hostile foreign nations â€“ that compromised major federal computer systems, exposing sensitive data. Nation-state adversaries and other malicious entities actively pose a fundamental threat to national security and global competitiveness, elevating the critical importance of software supply chain risk management.My testimony included an urgent Call to Action for the Government to shore up our collective software bill of materials (SBOM) vulnerabilities. We must:1 â€“ Prioritize awareness and education on the desired outcomes not just the compliance activities2 â€“ Fund the supply chain risk programs3 â€“ Make supply chain security â€“ hardware, SBOM, services â€“ the cost of doing business both in support of the government, as well as within the critical industrial base it relies on4 â€“ Ensure there is good contracting language to support these changesItâ€™s imperative we view these solutions as an investment in national security, not merely an expense. By upskilling personnel and leveraging supply chain security for prevention and resolution, we profoundly impact the federal software supply chain, fortifying our nation's security posture and global competitiveness. Thereâ€™s no question America is being targeted by our adversaries, who are relentlessly trying every digital backdoor in our multi-tier supply chains. Are we prepared to leave even one unlocked?

Always happy to contribute to Becker’s thought-provoking questions. Giles Bruce,Organizational Change Management,
"CEO: â€œWe need to replace our entire product teamâ€Me: â€œUm, ok, letâ€™s talk about this for a momentâ€¦â€As a CPO and product advisor Iâ€™ve met plenty of CEOs and execs who are frustrated with the results they see from their product teams.Often they feel like all they need to do is replace the existing team with more experienced, â€œbetterâ€ PMs. But really they're blaming PMs for some of their own shortcomings as leaders.Results from a product team depend on putting great PMs in a great environment.If you donâ€™t have a great environment, it doesnâ€™t matter how good your PMs are, youâ€™ll still be disappointed with the results.Maybe your PMs really are awful, but before you fire them all and hire new ones, Iâ€™d make sure you fix the environment:a) Itâ€™s much faster, cheaper and less painfulb) Youâ€™ll have to do it anywayc) Youâ€™ll be surprised by what you can get from your existing teamSo how do you create a great environment for PMs as a leader?ðŸŽ¯ Have consistent goalsOf course you want to be agile, but try not to change the priorities all the time. Every quarter is ok, but every week or two and your teams will never get going.ðŸ›¡ Minimize distractionsProgress is inversely correlated to the number of initiatives you have. Make sure your teams arenâ€™t getting distracted by execsâ€™ pet projects, internal requests or customer feedback. Have a very small (1-2) number of priorities for them to focus on.ðŸ—º Explain the contextSpend the time up front to explain your goals and the features youâ€™re asking for. If all youâ€™re doing is demanding widgets from your product team, likely theyâ€™ll have a very different idea from you of what they are building and why.ðŸ’° Talk about the moneyYou canâ€™t expect your PMs to make commercial decisions if they donâ€™t have visibility of the business financials. Make this a part of every discussion (but just a part - itâ€™s not everything!)ðŸ›‘ Be explicit where you will take riskTeams are usually quite conservative when it comes to risk, because when the site goes down they get blamed. If you want to move quickly, be very clear about the risks that you are willing to take. ðŸ‘¥ Manage their role breadthPMs can be excellent at lots of things - comms, analysis, delivery, user interviewsâ€¦ pretty much whatever you need them to, but they canâ€™t do it all at the same time - there are only so many hours in the day. Make sure tasks as split evenly across design, engineering and data.ðŸ“„ Agree a lightweight reporting processAs a leader you need status updates. To fly blind would be reckless. But bloated reporting burns many hours each week. Take 1-2 hours up front to co-create a reporting process with your PMs (i.e. tell them what you really need, and let them figure out the best way to deliver it) and youâ€™ll save them huge amounts of time going forward.And if thereâ€™s anything I can do to help, give me a shout. Weâ€™ve got lots of tools on Hustle Badger to accelerate product teams, and I offer private workshops and advice.",Organizational Change Management,checked

"â€œJoyce Oh, CIO of Tampa, Fla.-based Moffitt Cancer Center, said she isn't reading too much into the layoffs as Amazon has also recently cut jobs in nonhealthcare businesses such as Buy with Prime and Audible. But she is paying attention to the company's moves for competitive reasons. Personally speaking, I am more interested in following the adoption and success rates of the One Medical model as it helps inform on the demand for telehealth as well as the propensity of patients to switch providers based on ease of access and digitization of traditionally manual processes such as scheduling.""Well said!hashtag#moffitt",Organizational Change Management,

"Crafting a Winning Strategy for FundraisingIn Part 3 of our three-part series on raising capital for startups, we discuss winning strategies for closing your round. In Part 2, we discussed the stages of a startup's lifecycle, including pre-seed and seed rounds. In Part 3, we reviewed the key differences between angel and venture capital investors. Now we discuss best practices, whichever path you choose. Building Relationships EarlyStart engaging with potential investors before you need the capital. Establishing relationships early can pay dividends when you start your official fundraising round.While building your relationships, identify which investors best fit you. Don't go for the investor who has always lost money, they won't invest. Avoid one-hit wonders, you'll never repeat. Choose investors who have seen the best and worst of investments; they are your ideal investors. Market Research and ValidationThorough market research and validation are critical. Demonstrating a clear understanding of your market, customer needs, and competitive landscape can significantly boost your credibility with investors.Market research and product-market fit are more important than your pitch deck. Stop spending energy on making a perfect deck; just answer these five questions. Who are you (be authentic)?Why are you doing this (tell your story)?Where has the company been, and where is it going?When will you become profitable?How will achieve profitability?The Importance of a Data RoomPrepare a comprehensive data room with all relevant documents, including financial statements and projections for the next two years, market and competitor analysis, formation and other legal documents, key customer and contract lists, and more. This transparency can build trust and expedite the due diligence process.Strategic OutreachTailor your outreach to the right type of investor for your stage of growth. Personalize your communication and leverage warm introductions whenever possible. When possible, leverage referrals from other groups of investors. They carry weight with investors. If using cold emails, be succinct and attach your deck. Let the investor decide if they want to meet with you. Persistence and ResilienceFundraising is often a numbers game that requires persistence. Be prepared for rejections and use them as learning opportunities to refine your approach. Seek a hard ""no"" or ""yes,"" not a soft maybe. Even if an investor says yes, keep them warm until you receive the funds. If they say no, ask why and use that feedback to improve your next pitch. ConclusionNavigating the fundraising landscape requires a strategic, informed approach, especially for pre- and seed-stage startups. Understanding the differences between angel investors and venture capital and a well-prepared strategy can significantly enhance your chances of securing the capital necessary to fuel your startup's growth.  hashtag#startups hashtag#angelinvestors hashtag#venturecapital",Organizational Change Management,checked

"Classical Management vs. Lean Management
Which do you choose?

Classical Management is a command and control system,
that might work great on the battlefield,
but actually hinders the very production it is trying to manage.
Profit (shareholder value) is more important than 
providing customer value.
People are simply a cog in the machine.
Do what you're told,
Don't think for yourself.
High turn over plagues this management style.
Problems are ignored,
and the Firefighter is seen as the supreme manager. 

Lean Management by contrast
has its roots in the principle of respect for people.
Inefficiency is eliminated by focusing on
the elimination or reduction of waste within the process.
People are empowered to focus on 
adding value for the customer.
Problems are celebrated
as an opportunity to improve.
The manager that focuses on the root cause
is celebrated and promoted over 
the firefighter who never does figure out
why the fires are starting in the first place.
Systems thinking replaces shareholder value.
The byproduct of this is that
shareholder value increases as the worker
decreases costs and
increases production.
Morale improves.
Processes improve.
Customer satisfaction increases.
Overhead costs decrease.
Profit goes up.

I hope you enjoyed this spoof off of that great WB movie, The Matrix.

Last Saturday I was wondering if this is what it feels like when senior management is given the choice of sticking with 
traditional classical management or choosing Lean Management.

Unfortunately, most seem to choose the Blue pill.

Which would you choose?

"Last month, I was joined by 25 leaders across a dozen or so industries to discuss some of the more pressing questions around AI leadership, driving adoption, responsible deployment, the crucial balance between upskilling existing talent & bringing in fresh perspectives to bolster AI capabilities, and securing funding for AI initiatives.This morning, I had a seat at the table with another group of 25 data, analytics, and AI leaders to dig deeper. Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity. Organizations are implementing measures like acceptable tool lists, usage tracking, and effective communication around risk.-The application of GenAI in content generation demands clearer legal and regulatory guidance. Some organizations have airtight governance processes to ensure the responsible utilization of their AI tools.-While there are common risk factors across internal applications and customer-facing applications, there are additional concerns regarding the associated risks with customer-facing applications, particularly in safety-critical industries.-Future topics for discussion will include customizing and securing OpenAI chat interfaces, the complexities of data security, ensuring employee familiarity with administrative protocols, and optimizing OpenAI API usage.We look forward to reconvening next month.
