https://www.linkedin.com/in/romena-akhter-0583015/,"PE firms are recognizing the CIO's role in driving revenue, cost efficiency, and AI strategy – all critical for success. This elevates the CIO from a tactical leader to a strategic partner. Investors are increasingly looking for strong CIOs at PE-backed firms. This means the CIO profile becomes a key consideration during portfolio company selection. The PE focus on long-term value creation aligns perfectly with the strategic capabilities of a forward-thinking CIO. Building for the future requires strong technology leadership.

We need to identify CIOs who understand the PE landscape and can contribute to the firm's investment strategies. When placing CIOs, we must emphasize their strategic impact beyond just IT operations.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamstowitts/,"NEWS ALERT 📰🚨: The EU Parliament has just taken a significant step towards reducing single-use plastic waste in food and beverage packaging!

At NOMOQ, we're thrilled to see this progress towards a more sustainable future. And as advocates for a higher recycling rate in food and beverage packaging, we're aligned with the EU's vision for a circular economy.

In a similar move, Canada's Single-Use Plastics Prohibition Regulations aim to eliminate certain single-use plastics by 2030 to achieve zero plastic waste.

This news reaffirms our commitment to providing high-quality, fully recyclable cans for brands who share our passion for sustainability. How?

1️⃣ Our mission has always been to revolutionise digital can printing, making it accessible to beverage brands of all sizes. With our 'No Minimum Order Quantity' approach, we're breaking barriers and empowering creativity, while championing sustainability.

2️⃣ Our state-of-the-art technology transforms aluminium cans into stunning works of art, fully recyclable without labels or plastic sleeves. We are proud to be among the first globally, and the first in Europe, to pioneer this eco-friendly solution.

Stay tuned as we continue to lead the way in supplying decorated cans in small batch sizes for the beverage market. Together, let's create a more colourful and sustainable world, one can at a time.
