"I spoke with MedCity News at Oliver Wyman's Health Innovation Summit last week. Here are some insights into how we approach our technology investment strategy:

 There are two parts to AI - the product and change management - and they must work together 

 Choosing a certain vendor may not be just because of their technology but also price, accessibility, EHR integration, and other secondary factors 

 Prioritization is overrated - focus on solving many problems at the same time in order to try out different solutions in different environments

"This week I was honored to testify before congress on the vital issue of ""Securing the Federal Software Supply Chain,"" joined by prominent policy and association leaders James Lewis, Jamil Jaffer, and Roger Waldron, in a Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation subcommittee hearing chaired by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). I commend Chairwoman Mace and Ranking Member Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who continue to press for heightened federal supply chain resilience following high-profile hacks by threat actors "" including hostile foreign nations "" that compromised major federal computer systems, exposing sensitive data. Nation-state adversaries and other malicious entities actively pose a fundamental threat to national security and global competitiveness, elevating the critical importance of software supply chain risk management.My testimony included an urgent Call to Action for the Government to shore up our collective software bill of materials (SBOM) vulnerabilities. We must:1 "" Prioritize awareness and education on the desired outcomes not just the compliance activities2 "" Fund the supply chain risk programs3 "" Make supply chain security "" hardware, SBOM, services "" the cost of doing business both in support of the government, as well as within the critical industrial base it relies on4 "" Ensure there is good contracting language to support these changesIt's imperative we view these solutions as an investment in national security, not merely an expense. By upskilling personnel and leveraging supply chain security for prevention and resolution, we profoundly impact the federal software supply chain, fortifying our nation's security posture and global competitiveness. There's no question America is being targeted by our adversaries, who are relentlessly trying every digital backdoor in our multi-tier supply chains. Are we prepared to leave even one unlocked?

"CEO: ""We need to replace our entire product team""Me: ""Um, ok, let's talk about this for a moment""""As a CPO and product advisor I've met plenty of CEOs and execs who are frustrated with the results they see from their product teams.Often they feel like all they need to do is replace the existing team with more experienced, ""better"" PMs. But really they're blaming PMs for some of their own shortcomings as leaders.Results from a product team depend on putting great PMs in a great environment.If you don't have a great environment, it doesn't matter how good your PMs are, you'll still be disappointed with the results.Maybe your PMs really are awful, but before you fire them all and hire new ones, I'd make sure you fix the environment:a) It's much faster, cheaper and less painfulb) You'll have to do it anywayc) You'll be surprised by what you can get from your existing teamSo how do you create a great environment for PMs as a leader?YZ  Have consistent goalsOf course you want to be agile, but try not to change the priorities all the time. Every quarter is ok, but every week or two and your teams will never get going.Y Minimize distractionsProgress is inversely correlated to the number of initiatives you have. Make sure your teams aren't getting distracted by execs' pet projects, internal requests or customer feedback. Have a very small (1-2) number of priorities for them to focus on.Yo Explain the contextSpend the time up front to explain your goals and the features you're asking for. If all you're doing is demanding widgets from your product team, likely they'll have a very different idea from you of what they are building and why.Y Talk about the moneyYou can't expect your PMs to make commercial decisions if they don't have visibility of the business financials. Make this a part of every discussion (but just a part - it's not everything!)Y Be explicit where you will take riskTeams are usually quite conservative when it comes to risk, because when the site goes down they get blamed. If you want to move quickly, be very clear about the risks that you are willing to take. Y Manage their role breadthPMs can be excellent at lots of things - comms, analysis, delivery, user interviews"" pretty much whatever you need them to, but they can't do it all at the same time - there are only so many hours in the day. Make sure tasks as split evenly across design, engineering and data.Y Agree a lightweight reporting processAs a leader you need status updates. To fly blind would be reckless. But bloated reporting burns many hours each week. Take 1-2 hours up front to co-create a reporting process with your PMs (i.e. tell them what you really need, and let them figure out the best way to deliver it) and you'll save them huge amounts of time going forward.And if there's anything I can do to help, give me a shout. We've got lots of tools on Hustle Badger to accelerate product teams, and I offer private workshops and advice.",Organizational Change Management

"Crafting a Winning Strategy for FundraisingIn Part 3 of our three-part series on raising capital for startups, we discuss winning strategies for closing your round. In Part 2, we discussed the stages of a startup's lifecycle, including pre-seed and seed rounds. In Part 3, we reviewed the key differences between angel and venture capital investors. Now we discuss best practices, whichever path you choose. Building Relationships EarlyStart engaging with potential investors before you need the capital. Establishing relationships early can pay dividends when you start your official fundraising round.While building your relationships, identify which investors best fit you. Don't go for the investor who has always lost money, they won't invest. Avoid one-hit wonders, you'll never repeat. Choose investors who have seen the best and worst of investments; they are your ideal investors. Market Research and ValidationThorough market research and validation are critical. Demonstrating a clear understanding of your market, customer needs, and competitive landscape can significantly boost your credibility with investors.Market research and product-market fit are more important than your pitch deck. Stop spending energy on making a perfect deck; just answer these five questions. Who are you (be authentic)?Why are you doing this (tell your story)?Where has the company been, and where is it going?When will you become profitable?How will achieve profitability?The Importance of a Data RoomPrepare a comprehensive data room with all relevant documents, including financial statements and projections for the next two years, market and competitor analysis, formation and other legal documents, key customer and contract lists, and more. This transparency can build trust and expedite the due diligence process.Strategic OutreachTailor your outreach to the right type of investor for your stage of growth. Personalize your communication and leverage warm introductions whenever possible. When possible, leverage referrals from other groups of investors. They carry weight with investors. If using cold emails, be succinct and attach your deck. Let the investor decide if they want to meet with you. Persistence and ResilienceFundraising is often a numbers game that requires persistence. Be prepared for rejections and use them as learning opportunities to refine your approach. Seek a hard ""no"" or ""yes,"" not a soft maybe. Even if an investor says yes, keep them warm until you receive the funds. If they say no, ask why and use that feedback to improve your next pitch. ConclusionNavigating the fundraising landscape requires a strategic, informed approach, especially for pre- and seed-stage startups. Understanding the differences between angel investors and venture capital and a well-prepared strategy can significantly enhance your chances of securing the capital necessary to fuel your startup's growth.  hashtag#startups hashtag#angelinvestors hashtag#venturecapital",Organizational Change Management

"Classical Management vs. Lean Management
Which do you choose?

Classical Management is a command and control system,
that might work great on the battlefield,
but actually hinders the very production it is trying to manage.
Profit (shareholder value) is more important than 
providing customer value.
People are simply a cog in the machine.
Do what you're told,
Don't think for yourself.
High turn over plagues this management style.
Problems are ignored,
and the Firefighter is seen as the supreme manager. 

Lean Management by contrast
has its roots in the principle of respect for people.
Inefficiency is eliminated by focusing on
the elimination or reduction of waste within the process.
People are empowered to focus on 
adding value for the customer.
Problems are celebrated
as an opportunity to improve.
The manager that focuses on the root cause
is celebrated and promoted over 
the firefighter who never does figure out
why the fires are starting in the first place.
Systems thinking replaces shareholder value.
The byproduct of this is that
shareholder value increases as the worker
decreases costs and
increases production.
Morale improves.
Processes improve.
Customer satisfaction increases.
Overhead costs decrease.
Profit goes up.

I hope you enjoyed this spoof off of that great WB movie, The Matrix.

Last Saturday I was wondering if this is what it feels like when senior management is given the choice of sticking with 
traditional classical management or choosing Lean Management.

Unfortunately, most seem to choose the Blue pill.

Which would you choose?

"Last month, I was joined by 25 leaders across a dozen or so industries to discuss some of the more pressing questions around AI leadership, driving adoption, responsible deployment, the crucial balance between upskilling existing talent & bringing in fresh perspectives to bolster AI capabilities, and securing funding for AI initiatives.This morning, I had a seat at the table with another group of 25 data, analytics, and AI leaders to dig deeper. Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity. Organizations are implementing measures like acceptable tool lists, usage tracking, and effective communication around risk.-The application of GenAI in content generation demands clearer legal and regulatory guidance. Some organizations have airtight governance processes to ensure the responsible utilization of their AI tools.-While there are common risk factors across internal applications and customer-facing applications, there are additional concerns regarding the associated risks with customer-facing applications, particularly in safety-critical industries.-Future topics for discussion will include customizing and securing OpenAI chat interfaces, the complexities of data security, ensuring employee familiarity with administrative protocols, and optimizing OpenAI API usage.We look forward to reconvening next month.

"Success often starts small before rapidly scaling. We exemplified this with Zerup - a sugar-free syrup allowing you to craft wildly flavored drinks.  We launched Zerup with just one small production line to test the concept. Seeing immense demand after a few months, we boldly invested in scaling up with multiple major production line expansions. Zerup went from a novel idea to a booming success by starting lean, validating the market through real consumer adoption, and then aggressively scaling operations to meet skyrocketing demand.   Now over 1,000,000 bottles fly off shelves monthly!But why so popular? 40% of people drink <1.5L daily - impacting health & metabolism. We saw an opportunity to make water tasty without sacrificing fun!  Eighteen months ago, we developed Zerup - squeeze into any drink for wildly flavored H2O with 1-2 splashes. No sugar!This journey highlights the power of testing new concepts at a manageable size, then rapidly scaling proven winners.  We transformed Zerup from modest origins into a breakthrough 1M+/month hit!  kudos to Daniel Loidl & Nicolas Lother for enabling this.",Organizational Change Management

"It was great to see the progress made on Newell Brands' packaging sustainability goals we communicated over the last few years. Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

"Things not adding up? Struggling with incoherence? Welcome to professional Everything Everywhere All at Once.The Hope  On one hand, we're hearing things that inspire and give hope. A call for courageous leaders who get into the details in all the right ways, empower teams, and have the potential to improve our organizations. Agency, connecting with customers, seeing the impact of our work. Focusing on outcomes instead of outputs. The potential of AI. All of these things speak to purpose, hope, possibilities, and opportunities. They talk about fulfillment, career enhancement, and purpose.The Reality (For Many)  Multiple rounds of layoffs (amidst record profits). Truly hurtful hiring practices (""Oh whoops, we've decided to restructure, offer rescinded, thanks for the 3hr assignment""). Thoughtless RTO mandates. Same old corporate doublespeak in all companiesstartups, 100y  enterprises, and everything in between. Tech CEOs are saying dumb, insensitive things that are so predictably biased that it hurts to listen. Gaslighting is in full effect.A rapidly declining sense of loyalty in companies. We're still working through the trauma of the pandemic. The climate change news is terrifying. Global conflict. A reported epidemic of loneliness (here in the US).We're bombarded by a full range of perspectives on AI, from blind AI fan-boy enthusiasm all the way to complete Luddism and genuine fear for jobs and everything in between. Across the spectrum of companies, regardless of maturity, we're hearing about things that are not good, or at least not as good as we thought (or wanted to believe).The Advice...  And then you have people dealing with all this in their own way or trying to help others, -Give them a version of harsh truth / tough love in an effort to help.-Help them be more resilient, accepting, and pragmatic.-Support their job search and analyze the current job market. Discuss how roles will change or not change. -Urge people to adapt their skills and encourage companies to transform.They are all doing what people do for the most part, which is trying to help in their own way. But sometimes it isn't landing. There's a deluge of coping advice.My realization  People are tired. People feel in limbo. People are questioning themselves, their companies, and their craft. It's not the rate of change that is truly gripping people, it is the tension of the change.It is crucial to be empathetic, sensitive, and helpful in genuine ways. Our default ways of helping may not even be helpful right now, so it's important to be super self-aware. We all need someone to listen and not lecture.I've written, taught, spoken, and drawn infographics for many years about good products, high-performing teams, feature factories, and continuous improvement.

"A few years ago I worked with an airline to improve the utilization of the commercial cargo with very nifty AI-based Revenue Management solutions. The technology could get the airline 10ppt extra utilization across its entire network (worth over $100M per year in bottom line) but they could not get to that value until they got airport palletizing procedures to be optimized and cargo sales reps to use the technology in their day to day workflow. Both critical non-tech changes.For real value, it's #NeverJustTech - There is so much more to consider in order to maximize the performance of digital and AI solutions. Every time a new solutions gets introduced to optimize a process or a customer experience, there will likely be changes required upstream and downstream of that process as per my airline example. That's why business leaders must own the reimagination of that business process with technology AND also own the change management. It's also why such efforts are so often failing if they are tucked too low in the organization with managers who don't own the end-to-end process or if they are being pushed by IT. #McKinseyDigital #RewiredBook",Organizational Change Management

"When you take a company-centric sales approach:

 you force B2B buyers down the funnel before theyre ready to buy
 youre not aligned with how buyers want to buy 
 you damage your brand
 you lose delas

But in reality, the B2B buying process is complex and looks like a maze. 

And you need to:

 Deliver value through multiple touchpoints
 
Because its the accumulation of touchpoints over time that drives your buyers to take action.

 Give them the time they need to make buying decisions 

Because it takes time for B2B buyers to:

1- Become problem aware
2- Prioritize solving this problem
3- Become category/solution aware
4- Ensure the buying committee is on board
5- Allocate a budget to solve this problem
6- Choose your brand & buy

 Understand how they prioritize problems, and research & evaluate solutions 

Because its the foundation of how you do marketing, unless you want assumption-led growth. Making customer research a priority is no longer optional.

We also had an opportunity to meet with the ITLT on the ground, and addressed their questions on how we deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. 
> We had the opportunity to meet with our individual team members in Mexico face-to-face and discuss individual team priorities.
> We worked with our various P&O colleagues on topics such as attracting and retaining talent in the NOCC as well as advancing our interactions as a team, with a focus on enhancing our collaboration and communication skills. 
> We also had some fun and bonding activities, such as a cultural tour of the city where we immersed in the wonderful Mexican Culture.

"During my career I have been privileged to work in some fantastic companies and had the opportunity to grow in ways I never would have imagined. A lot of this growth was down to the people I worked with, who inspired and developed me, shared feedback to make me stronger and believed in me when I most needed it. There are too many to mention but you know who you are  .

Every experience brings different learning. But when your growth has been defined by job title, level, promotions and status, moving to a newly formed, flat organisation with high growth ambitions can be confusing. It can be difficult to recognise growth without tangible symbols, and the workload, urgency and ambiguity can be overwhelming. 

At TBG we wanted to create an event to explore what is different about this type of experience - and how we can make the most of it whilst building understanding of what skills and experiences we are adding to our toolkit.  Last Thursday we hosted a morning of activities - including an insightful panel discussion featuring Russell Kronenburg, Malcolm Devine and Isabelle Ehrmantraut, interactive workshops to explore trust, feedback and reframing and an overview of how we will enable people growth as the business grows. It was a brilliant opportunity to step back and take stock of how far we have come and the road ahead. 

A massive thank you to everyone who got involved - especially the brilliant team of volunteers from across our team who put their hearts and heads into the event. You really brought this to life.

- Data Analysis (for 2 months)
- Data Visualization 
- How to work with Healthcare Data 
- Understanding aspects of Healthcare Operations
- Understanding frameworks and application of Process Improvement

Excited to immerse myself in the industry I love with a well experienced cohort of caregivers, operational leaders and analytics developers. Excited to share thoughts, but more excited to learn from and with these team members. This is one of many steps ahead of us in the development of our enterprise data academy and data fluency education & training programs journey. Finally, shout out to our partners Maddie Banas & Desiree Winters for their dedication to the advancement of this program and impact on our broader care continuum.

Can't wait to share some of our lessons learned, but more excited about another advancement on this pillar of our enterprise data & analytics journey  in coming weeks. 

Be sure to stay tune!

"What does Bruce Lee, the greatest martial artist of all time, have to do with Enterprise Architecture? Last week, I had the honor to be the keynote speaker at IQPC's Chief AI Officer Exchange in Fort Lauderdale, where I explored the evolution of Enterprise Architecture and the skillset required to be a ""Full-stack"" Architect. 
 
Bruce Lee's famous quote on being ""like water"", showcases his philosophy on his martial art style, to be flexible and adapt. While I'm not saying architects go to combat (although sometimes it feels that way  ), flexibility and the adaptability is also one of the key skillsets to be an effective architect, and is a quality that is foundational to be a Full-stack architect. Architecture is a fluid space and the value we bring to the organization, while immense, hinges on our ability to adjust to change, as we work with a variety of stakeholders across the Enterprise. 
 
I had so much fun discussing architecture, AI, and other interesting topics with my fellow leaders at this event. Thanks to James Stevenson-Roberts and his team and I look forward to future events!",Organizational Change Management

"Falling in love with the problem, before jumping into solutions, helps you go slow to go fast. It creates a deep understanding of the challenge...  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders... how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent... how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within... saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

"Is your company well-positioned to take advantage of the coming AI wave?

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

AI-Enabled Company 

	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

AI-Centered Company 

	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

	Has multiple core business processes AI-enabled, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

	Has a change management program and employee re-education program to help up-level their knowledge to incorporate AI. 

AI is fast becoming a core driver of innovation, growth and competitive advantage. 

What are your thoughts on the future of AI?

"Human capital management in PE value creation? Its all about the C-suiteuntil it isnt.
 
Thats the big finding in our brand-new original research, conducted with support from the Ford Foundation Mission Investments team.
 
Conventional wisdom is that, as a strategy to maximize enterprise value, large PE firms focus human capital management efforts at the top of the org chartand our research validated that. 

But as we dug deeper, we kept hearing, Well, there was this one deal....

We studied 7 large (AUM >$5B) private equity firms, including BlackRock Impact Opportunities Fund and TPG, and found that when lower-level workers play a *clear* and essential role in executing the value creation strategy for a particular deal, large private equity firms will dedicate resources to the bottom of the org chart. And when they do, they get better business results. 

Check out our report for snapshots from the front line in PE deals.
 
Done right, research leads to new questionsthese are ours:

 What are the missed opportunities for value creation when deal teams dont engage the bottom of the org chart? 
 Do PE deal teams have what they need to leverage human capital below the C-suite to drive enterprise value? 
 
WORC (Workforce & Organizational Research Center) is grateful to all the fund managers, human capital operating partners, investment team members, and others who were so generous with their time and insights. 

A huge thanks to Margot Brandenburg and Abeda Iqbal for their encouragement and thought partnership throughout.

"Every year at The AES Corporation, we celebrate Safety Day. Safety is our first value and top priority, and this week, our AES Utilities in Indiana and Ohio paused and reflected on our Safety legacy to inform how we can execute our work for the future. The AES Utilities use technology and innovation to improve safety practices, which enables us to reliably serve our customers and communities.

At AES Indiana, we recognized the AES Indiana team at Eagle Valley Generating Station on their significant efforts to improve their safety performance through implementing emergency management, designing an outstanding training program, and performing effective audits. In Ohio, we recognized the tireless efforts of AES Ohio crews and contractors for their restoration efforts earlier this spring when storms impacted more than 36,000 customers across the 24-county service territory. In moments like this, we know our customers look to us to get power restored as quickly as possible, and its our responsibility to do this as safely as possible. At AES El Salvador, the immense potential of technology allows us to streamline and make our processes safer, such as using drones for inspecting our distribution grids and applying AI and machine learning to predict and detect unauthorized residential electrical connections.

This week reaffirmed our commitment to employee, contractor and public safety and the commitment we have to each other to ensure each one of us returns home safely at the end of every day, and that is made possible by the hard work and agility of every person who is part of our AES Utilities Team.

"Greek philosopher Heraclitus is often tagged as the person who said that ""the only thing constant is change"". 

Change is on my mind lately in different actual sales cycles, circumstances, combinations and permutations as I am getting more heavily involved in AI, ML and ML Ops. 

If you think about AI as a definitive enabling disruption of our time, change management should be top of mind and a priority consideration.

Last week, I managed to visit Workz A/S (a premiere Change Management company) in Copenhagen and through the kindness of my good friend Edoardo Montenegro, I was able to learn more about change management by actually playing one of their very popular strategy board games called hashtag #WallBreakers. This game is a simulation of a merger and acquisition situation of 2 tech companies navigating the difficult task of change, post merger. Thank you also Ask Agger.

5 IMPORTANT CHANGE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Change is hard and complex. Know the WHYs of the change.
2. Sequence and speed of change matters. 
3. Know the players and catalysts of change. 
4. You cannot force change but you can manage & empower it. 
 Start with small strategic wins.
5. Get professional help and an actual playbook.

As I like numbers, I am appreciative of thought leaders like Greg Satell who also writes about change and recently wrote about how a minority in an organisation 25% can be a tipping point number to actually effect organizational change (actual article in the comments below).

AI will be part of every organisation. If you don't have a game plan change management strategy, you will likely have a lot of challenges. 

If you are all in AI instead of just experimenting and ""tinkering"", think about the strategy and how to win over the 25% as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

As change management is a ""human-centered"" practice, we have to really lean into the human side even if the intervention is enabling technology.''

"Great to be on Morning Joe today talking about American Medical Association priorities to improve healthcare access, reduce physician burnout, improve sustainability of the Medicare program, deal with cyberattacks in healthcare, and navigate the promise of AI.

As I arrive in the final weeks of my AMA presidency  a year on the road, a year meeting with physicians, a year of seeing and hearing about the challenges facing our health system  I see a system in crisis. The Change Healthcare cyberattack and ensuing reimbursement challenges could not have come at a worse time. 
 
But we are years  and a confluence of preventable events  into whats made it the worst possible time. 
 
Physicians have known for some time that our Medicare payment system that reimburses physicians for the care we provide was failing  and this was creating severe financial stress for physicians in private practice, which are the backbone of our health care safety net, particularly in rural and underserved communities.
 
When you adjust for inflation, the payment rate to physicians who care for Medicare patients has dropped 29% since my first year of medical school in 2001!
 
Then theres burnout, driven by onerous burdens like prior authorization. Consider that roughly two in three doctors admitted to experiencing burnout during the pandemic, according to a survey from the AMA, the Mayo Clinic and Stanford University School of Medicine. Thats the highest level of burnout ever recorded by the AMA!

Consider that 1 in 5 physicians surveyed during the pandemic said they planned to leave medicine within the next 2 years, while 1 in 3 said theyd cut back on their hours.

Consider that nearly half of all practicing physicians in the U.S. today are over age 55.

Consider that foreign-trained physicians, called International Medical Graduates or IMGs, face enormous obstaclessuch as immigration and green-card delaysto practice medicine in the U.S.
 
Consider that the average young doctor now leaves medical school more than $250,000 in debt, and that this heavy debt load has huge implications for our health system, often forcing aspiring physicians to bypass primary care and less populated, rural areas in favor of more lucrative specialties in or near large cities.
 
This is not sustainable. And I worry that health outcomes across the country will continue to decline unless we take the necessary steps today to bolster our physician workforce, reform our broken Medicare payment system, and create a sustainable model for health care that ensures access to care for all who need it  urban and rural alike.
 
So we must continue our quest to: 
       Maintain payment for digital health tools that work
       Fix prior authorization to reduce delays for pts
       Reduce physician burnout 
       Address the stigma around mental health
       Reform Medicare payment to support seniors

Its time to rebuild, and the AMA is ready.",Organizational Change Management
"When you reach for a Kenvue product on the store shelf, chances are you dont think about its journey into your hands. You just appreciate the fact its there when you need it.
 
A seamless #SupplyChain is key to our mission to deliver everyday moments of care when people need them most. And there are so many behind-the-scenes links that make up this supply chain. It starts with our trusted suppliers. 
 
Its not every day you have the opportunity to gather so many incredible companies in the same room, but thats exactly what we did when we launched our new supplier program this week. Not only did we introduce leaders from key suppliers to Kenvue as a stand-alone company, giving the event an extra-special energy, but around every corner we found new ways to grow together, including supporting our Healthy Lives Mission. Were leaving that room with a shared vision for the future.
 
I have every confidence in our ability execute with excellence and meaningfully impact consumers.
