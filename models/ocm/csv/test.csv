"""Joyce Oh, CIO of Tampa, Fla.-based Moffitt Cancer Center, said she isn't reading too much into the layoffs as Amazon has also recently cut jobs in nonhealthcare businesses such as Buy with Prime and Audible. But she is paying attention to the company's moves for competitive reasons. Personally speaking, I am more interested in following the adoption and success rates of the One Medical model as it helps inform on the demand for telehealth as well as the propensity of patients to switch providers based on ease of access and digitization of traditionally manual processes such as scheduling.""Well said!hashtag#moffitt",Organizational Change Management

"Success often starts small before rapidly scaling. We exemplified this with Zerup - a sugar-free syrup allowing you to craft wildly flavored drinks.  We launched Zerup with just one small production line to test the concept. Seeing immense demand after a few months, we boldly invested in scaling up with multiple major production line expansions. Zerup went from a novel idea to a booming success by starting lean, validating the market through real consumer adoption, and then aggressively scaling operations to meet skyrocketing demand.   Now over 1,000,000 bottles fly off shelves monthly!But why so popular? 40% of people drink <1.5L daily - impacting health & metabolism. We saw an opportunity to make water tasty without sacrificing fun!  Eighteen months ago, we developed Zerup - squeeze into any drink for wildly flavored H2O with 1-2 splashes. No sugar!This journey highlights the power of testing new concepts at a manageable size, then rapidly scaling proven winners.  We transformed Zerup from modest origins into a breakthrough 1M+/month hit!  kudos to Daniel Loidl & Nicolas Lother for enabling this.",Organizational Change Management

"Falling in love with the problem, before jumping into solutions, helps you go slow to go fast. It creates a deep understanding of the challenge...  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders... how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent... how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within... saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

"Healthcare has been through lots of centralizing and outsourcing over the last decade plus.  This coupled with a workforce that has become more virtual since COVID-the human connection has been lost.  A prime example of this is access and navigation centers.    We are bringing that human connection back through assigning schedulers, nurse intake and other key support resources to physician teams.  This will include regular huddles and direct communication between physicians, APPs and the support teams.  Technology will be and enabler of huddles and relationship building. Having these direct connections and relationships between team members will help smooth out any nuances in a day and allow the workforce to be in person or remote.  The trusted relationship is key.

"PE firms are recognizing the CIO's role in driving revenue, cost efficiency, and AI strategy  all critical for success. This elevates the CIO from a tactical leader to a strategic partner. Investors are increasingly looking for strong CIOs at PE-backed firms. This means the CIO profile becomes a key consideration during portfolio company selection. The PE focus on long-term value creation aligns perfectly with the strategic capabilities of a forward-thinking CIO. Building for the future requires strong technology leadership.

We need to identify CIOs who understand the PE landscape and can contribute to the firm's investment strategies. When placing CIOs, we must emphasize their strategic impact beyond just IT operations.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Crafting a Winning Strategy for FundraisingIn Part 3 of our three-part series on raising capital for startups, we discuss winning strategies for closing your round. In Part 2, we discussed the stages of a startup's lifecycle, including pre-seed and seed rounds. In Part 3, we reviewed the key differences between angel and venture capital investors. Now we discuss best practices, whichever path you choose. Building Relationships EarlyStart engaging with potential investors before you need the capital. Establishing relationships early can pay dividends when you start your official fundraising round.While building your relationships, identify which investors best fit you. Don't go for the investor who has always lost money, they won't invest. Avoid one-hit wonders, you'll never repeat. Choose investors who have seen the best and worst of investments; they are your ideal investors. Market Research and ValidationThorough market research and validation are critical. Demonstrating a clear understanding of your market, customer needs, and competitive landscape can significantly boost your credibility with investors.Market research and product-market fit are more important than your pitch deck. Stop spending energy on making a perfect deck; just answer these five questions. Who are you (be authentic)?Why are you doing this (tell your story)?Where has the company been, and where is it going?When will you become profitable?How will achieve profitability?The Importance of a Data RoomPrepare a comprehensive data room with all relevant documents, including financial statements and projections for the next two years, market and competitor analysis, formation and other legal documents, key customer and contract lists, and more. This transparency can build trust and expedite the due diligence process.Strategic OutreachTailor your outreach to the right type of investor for your stage of growth. Personalize your communication and leverage warm introductions whenever possible. When possible, leverage referrals from other groups of investors. They carry weight with investors. If using cold emails, be succinct and attach your deck. Let the investor decide if they want to meet with you. Persistence and ResilienceFundraising is often a numbers game that requires persistence. Be prepared for rejections and use them as learning opportunities to refine your approach. Seek a hard ""no"" or ""yes,"" not a soft maybe. Even if an investor says yes, keep them warm until you receive the funds. If they say no, ask why and use that feedback to improve your next pitch. ConclusionNavigating the fundraising landscape requires a strategic, informed approach, especially for pre- and seed-stage startups. Understanding the differences between angel investors and venture capital and a well-prepared strategy can significantly enhance your chances of securing the capital necessary to fuel your startup's growth.  hashtag#startups hashtag#angelinvestors hashtag#venturecapital",Organizational Change Management

Bruce Lee's famous quote on being ""like water"", showcases his philosophy on his martial art style, to be flexible and adapt. While I'm not saying architects go to combat (although sometimes it feels that way  ), flexibility and the adaptability is also one of the key skillsets to be an effective architect, and is a quality that is foundational to be a Full-stack architect. Architecture is a fluid space and the value we bring to the organization, while immense, hinges on our ability to adjust to change, as we work with a variety of stakeholders across the Enterprise.

A lot of this growth was down to the people I worked with, who inspired and developed me, shared feedback to make me stronger and believed in me when I most needed it. There are too many to mention but you know who you are  .

Every experience brings different learning. But when your growth has been defined by job title, level, promotions and status, moving to a newly formed, flat organisation with high growth ambitions can be confusing. It can be difficult to recognise growth without tangible symbols, and the workload, urgency and ambiguity can be overwhelming. 

At TBG we wanted to create an event to explore what is different about this type of experience - and how we can make the most of it whilst building understanding of what skills and experiences we are adding to our toolkit.  Last Thursday we hosted a morning of activities - including an insightful panel discussion featuring Russell Kronenburg, Malcolm Devine and Isabelle Ehrmantraut, interactive workshops to explore trust, feedback and reframing and an overview of how we will enable people growth as the business grows. It was a brilliant opportunity to step back and take stock of how far we have come and the road ahead. 

A massive thank you to everyone who got involved - especially the brilliant team of volunteers from across our team who put their hearts and heads into the event. You really brought this to life.

"Is your company well-positioned to take advantage of the coming AI wave?

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

AI-Enabled Company 

	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

AI-Centered Company 

	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

	Has multiple core business processes AI-enabled, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

	Has a change management program and employee re-education program to help up-level their knowledge to incorporate AI. 

AI is fast becoming a core driver of innovation, growth and competitive advantage. 

What are your thoughts on the future of AI?

I will forever cherish the memories and experiences I've gained during my time at the company. But, I am excited about my new role and the challenges it will bring. Thank you, Ball, for an incredible journey!",Not Organizational Change Management
