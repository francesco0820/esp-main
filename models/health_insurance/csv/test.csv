"Thank you to everyone who participated in our Fusion Fund 2023 Annual Meeting last week! It was a great pleasure to welcome the broader Fusion Fund community of LPs, founders, and ecosystem members to Silicon Valley, and hear from our special guest Eric S. Yuan (he / him / his), CEO of Zoom, our portfolio founders, and members of our Fusion CXO Network.
Reflecting on our fund's trajectory, I am proud of the growth and accomplishments we've achieved over the past years. It was a privilege to share these insights and to discuss the technological trends and opportunities that lie ahead for us in venture capital. Meanwhile, my Partner Trevor Mottl's analysis of the expanding influence of AI provided a comprehensive look at its role in shaping both public and private markets.
One of the evening's highlights was the fireside chat with our guest speaker Eric S. Yuan (he / him / his). The conversation was super inspiring, offering us deep insights into the tech ecosystem's evolution and the future of AI, and reminding us of the entrepreneurial spirit that propels our industry forward.
The ambition and creativity of our portfolio founders shone through as they outlined the groundbreaking platforms they are building.

"Letter to Harvard University President Gay:
Dear President Gay:
I am an alumnus of Harvard College 1992, Government. My tutor and thesis advisor was Dame Louise Richardson, who I am sure you know went on to be the head of Oxford and whose academic scholarship is on terrorism. I am also an Israeli citizen and reside in Israel for the past 20 years. This week, my best friends lost their son fighting Hamas terrorists, another colleague lost his elderly parent to Hamas butchery and friends have a son who attended the rave party, was severely wounded and is held in Gaza by Hamas. There were 13 funerals in my relatively small city Ra'anana this week alone.
I am deeply troubled by what is missing in your statements around these terrorist events. You condemn the Hamas barbarism, but you speak mostly about listening to each other in the Harvard community. While that is important, now is a time for you as the leader of Harvard to speak much more clearly and forcefully against terror. Harvard does not only exist to foster dialogue among its students. Harvard's alumni and students, certainly of the Government department and the Law, Business and Kennedy Schools, are and will be leaders of governments, corporations, international organizations, etc. Harvard's mission is to create actors, not only talkers, on the world stage as a force for good.
In order to do this, as Harvard's leader you must speak more forcefully and unequivocally. Not just to condemn the barbarism. Your message should be clear and unequivocal, not just to support Israeli victims, but to SAVE GAZA AND THE PALESTINIANS FROM HAMAS! Hamas's horrific crimes against Israelis this week and over the years are secondary only to their horrific crimes against their own people since their founding. They have singlehandedly (alongside Islamic Jihad) and too effectively prolonged the Palestinian Israeli conflict, wreaked death and destruction among their people all while profiting "" be it in capital for their leadership or murderous suicide missions for their nihilistic ideology. They threaten to drag the world into a global conflict. This is all historical truth, not perspective. Harvard must stand for truth.
Palestinians who say that Hamas represent them have made a clear choice "" they choose and support terrorism - that Harvard must reject. You can make a difference if you are clearer about the University's position. This is a time for moral clarity to prevail. Harvard is a bastion of education. Harvard leadership should be screaming from the top of its lungs "" end the education of hate and antisemitism that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have perpetrated to Palestinian children for decades. Hamas has brought ruin to the Palestinian cause, to the cause of peace and co-existence. That message must be clear to the entire educated world, and you should lead it. Please consult Dame Richardson and her 2006 book What Terrorists Want. There is much to learn from her.

"The value of approving appropriate care: learn how HealthHelp is redefining the prior authorization process.

""If something that should have been approved doesn't get approved, there's a delay in care. That provider also has to go through an appeals process. There's extra work for that provider and a delay, both which ultimately affect the member. The value of the HealthHelp model is that we invest in the front-end to eliminate the chance that a request may not be approved.

"I joined Anjalee Khemlani of Yahoo Finance on her show yesterday to discuss the incursion of retail organizations like Amazon and CVS Health into healthcare delivery with their acquisitions of One Medical and Oak Street Health and Signify Health. I also talked about the growing tension between for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare.
A snippet from our interview:
""But as somebody who runs a nonprofit health care organization, I worry that some of these large entities will put profits before patients. And I think that is a real risk that we have to grapple with. I think the American public is tired of being seen as a profit center when it comes to their health and their wellness.
And so I think that there is an opportunity, actually, for the nonprofit sector to step up and start to try to make some bigger moves.
That's something that we're doing at SCAN. We announced our intention to merge with CareOregon, which is a nonprofit Medicaid-focused health plan in Oregon, and really try to make one plus one equals three to improve the experience for patients because I do think that the American consumer is tired of being seen as a profit center by US health care.""",Health insurance

"Last week, I was in Washington, D.C. meeting with federal policymakers to discuss some of Blue Shield of California's key initiatives. I was met with enthusiasm regarding our efforts to reimagine the pharmacy care model to one that delivers streamlined, transparent, and affordable pharmacy and prescription drug services for our members. There was an eagerness and understanding to support our efforts and to encourage more transparency for pharmacy services.
The other area of discussion was California's digital data-sharing mandate. With the deficit this year forecast to reach $2 trillion, policymakers understand that our current healthcare spending trend is unsustainable. Bringing health care into the digital age presents an opportunity to drive major efficiencies, improve the customer experience, and eliminate pain points like paper-based prior authorization.
I am encouraged by the reforms we are leading and our position as a health plan that is willing to take meaningful steps to create a healthcare system that is worthy of our family and friends and sustainably affordable for everyone. #healthcare #healthcarereform #whatwestandfor",Health insurance
"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
""For early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
""Additionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.""
At HealthHelp, our evidence-based guidelines prioritize what's best for the patient. By staying up-to-date with the latest research and medical practices, we ensure that every decision made is in the best interest of the patient's well-being. Our radiation oncology program is based on physician collaboration and education. This includes our proactive specialist outreach that allows ordering physicians the opportunity to connect with practicing peers at leading cancer centers to discuss treatment pans that maximize patient outcomes.

From claims processing to customer service, digitization ensures real-time data insights and decision-making.
Y1 Machine Learning & AI: These technologies could automate and make healthcare insurance processes faster and more efficient. They can assist in summarizing lab test results, automating care journeys, and even predicting the best care pathways for individuals.

"HealthHelp's NPS of 57 with ordering physicians and their staff can also serve as a predictor of a member's overall satisfaction with their insurer.
Throughout the specialty benefits management process, the safety and well-being of the patient is always consideration number one. HealthHelp also recognizes that the member's overall satisfaction with their experience, and ultimately with their health insurer, is influenced heavily by the interaction between their physician and the payer.
This is where prior authorization can muddy the relationship. A traditional, denial based Utilization Management model can be challenging for a physician to navigate. The potentially negative experience of obtaining a prior authorization can trickle down to the conversation between the patient and their physician's office. Its during the course of this conversation that the ordering physician's frustration is transferred to the member.
