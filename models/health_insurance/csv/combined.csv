"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
""For early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
""Additionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.""
At HealthHelp, our evidence-based guidelines prioritize what's best for the patient. By staying up-to-date with the latest research and medical practices, we ensure that every decision made is in the best interest of the patient's well-being. Our radiation oncology program is based on physician collaboration and education. This includes our proactive specialist outreach that allows ordering physicians the opportunity to connect with practicing peers at leading cancer centers to discuss treatment pans that maximize patient outcomes.

"As I consider the future of the tax profession, diversity continues to be a top priority. Creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce is mission critical, and leaders "" myself included "" need to prioritize tangible solutions that create more opportunities for diverse talent to enter and succeed in our profession. A more balanced workforce ultimately leads to an improved culture and more profitable business. Today, KPMG US launched its 2023 Impact Report sharing the many strides we've made as a firm and practice in support of our people and planet. The report is one more great example of our commitment to diversity, transparency, culture, sustainable practices and our principles. In Tax specifically, one tangible example of our commitment to diversity is our recently launched Tax Scholarship Program. The program is designed to enable individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to further their studies at a school of their choice and grants up to $40K in funding to eligible students, giving them access to the vast KPMG Tax network, including mentors, coaches, internship opportunities and more.
Below are just a few more examples of ways KPMG is working to expand our diversity, as outlined in the report: - Rehires have increased year over year, especially for those from underrepresented backgrounds - 49% of new hires identify as part of an underrepresented racial/ethnic group - Over two-thirds of our FY23 promotion class are from underrepresented backgrounds. To learn more about how a continued investment in our people has been fundamental to our success as a firm, I hope you'll read through this latest Impact Report. While there's always more work to do, we have much to be proud of and I'm looking forward to continuing our important work #Together.

"August 14 may be #FinancialAwarenessDay, but there rarely goes a day in my life where I'm not talking about, in some way or another, the importance of financial health "" especially for women.
We built Ellevest because we believe that your financial health is connected intrinsically with your overall health. It's not just about dollars and cents "" it's about having control over your life, your choices, and your future.
Deciding you want to take control of your money is the easy part. The tricky part can be figuring out how. It starts with establishing an essential set of habits and practices that create the lasting financial security and stability you need to design, build, and live the life you want. That includes checking in on your finances regularly, budgeting for spending *and* debt, investing a part of every paycheck, keeping a healthy emergency fund, and having an overall financial plan in place.
What difference does this all make?
Research shows that people with a financial plan have 3x the net worth of those who don't. Triple the wealth!
And for women, the difference is compounded "" because we start out with less than men, have fewer financial opportunities than men, and end up with less than men.
These gender gaps can be crippling: Women are more likely to end up in poverty in retirement than men.
So if you don't feel in control of your finances yet, today's a good day to start. Start investing, start budgeting, start planning "" and if you need some expert help "" well, you know where to go:

"Compiled by Vatan HA14zeir, the latest cache of internal documents describing Big Oil's concealed knowledge of global warming is a gold mine.
One bombshell is a confidential Shell scenario report from 1989 which imagined two futures: SUSTAINABLE WORLD and GLOBAL MERCANTILISM.
In SUSTAINABLE WORLD, greenhouse gas emissions would peak around the year 2000 and decline rapidly thereafter, and total CO2 concentrations would be limited to 400 ppm. GLOBAL MERCANTILISM, on the other hand, would see emissions continue to rise (this is the path we're on).
What would the world be like under GLOBAL MERCANTILISM (the path we're on)? According to Shell, ""There would be more violent weather - more storms, more droughts, more deluges. Mean sea level would rise at least 30 cm. Agricultural patterns would be most dramatically changed. Something as simple as a moderate change in rainfall pattern disrupts eco-systems, and many species of trees, plants, animals and insects would not be able to move and adapt.""
""The changes would, however, most impact on humans,"" Shell
went on. ""In earlier times, man was able to respond with his feet. Today, there is no place to go because people already stand there. Perhaps those in industrial countries could cope with a rise in sea level (the Dutch example) but for poor countries such defences are not possible.""
""The potential refugee problem in GLOBAL MERCANTILISM could be unprecedented,"" Shell predicted. ""Africans would push into Europe, Chinese into the Soviet Union, Latins into the United States, Indonesians into Australia. Boundaries would count for little - overwhelmed by the numbers. Conflicts would abound. Civilization could prove a fragile thing. The logic of SUSTAINABLE WORLD is a society choosing to channel some investments into environmental maintenance against this contingency.""
And yet despite these predictions, Shell chose to push the world into the high-carbon scenario it knew would be so disastrous.
The company spent the next decade denying the existence of global warming through disinformation groups like the Global Climate Coalition. And then spent the last two decades giving false reassurances that it's moving away from fossil fuels, all while actually expanding its fossil fuel business and blocking the fossil fuel controls it knows are needed to avoid irreversible global damage.
Other nuggets from Shell's document:
- admits the ""principal source"" of CO2 is ""fossil fuel combustion""
- notes methane a powerful greenhouse gas about 25 times more potent than CO2
- foreshadows the use of offsets to enable more fossil fuel use
This document underscores the fact that Shell and the broader fossil fuel industry had a choice and knowingly chose global disaster in exchange for short term profits.

"Letter to Harvard University President Gay:
Dear President Gay:
I am an alumnus of Harvard College 1992, Government. My tutor and thesis advisor was Dame Louise Richardson, who I am sure you know went on to be the head of Oxford and whose academic scholarship is on terrorism. I am also an Israeli citizen and reside in Israel for the past 20 years. This week, my best friends lost their son fighting Hamas terrorists, another colleague lost his elderly parent to Hamas butchery and friends have a son who attended the rave party, was severely wounded and is held in Gaza by Hamas. There were 13 funerals in my relatively small city Ra'anana this week alone.
I am deeply troubled by what is missing in your statements around these terrorist events. You condemn the Hamas barbarism, but you speak mostly about listening to each other in the Harvard community. While that is important, now is a time for you as the leader of Harvard to speak much more clearly and forcefully against terror. Harvard does not only exist to foster dialogue among its students. Harvard's alumni and students, certainly of the Government department and the Law, Business and Kennedy Schools, are and will be leaders of governments, corporations, international organizations, etc. Harvard's mission is to create actors, not only talkers, on the world stage as a force for good.
In order to do this, as Harvard's leader you must speak more forcefully and unequivocally. Not just to condemn the barbarism. Your message should be clear and unequivocal, not just to support Israeli victims, but to SAVE GAZA AND THE PALESTINIANS FROM HAMAS! Hamas's horrific crimes against Israelis this week and over the years are secondary only to their horrific crimes against their own people since their founding. They have singlehandedly (alongside Islamic Jihad) and too effectively prolonged the Palestinian Israeli conflict, wreaked death and destruction among their people all while profiting "" be it in capital for their leadership or murderous suicide missions for their nihilistic ideology. They threaten to drag the world into a global conflict. This is all historical truth, not perspective. Harvard must stand for truth.
Palestinians who say that Hamas represent them have made a clear choice "" they choose and support terrorism - that Harvard must reject. You can make a difference if you are clearer about the University's position. This is a time for moral clarity to prevail. Harvard is a bastion of education. Harvard leadership should be screaming from the top of its lungs "" end the education of hate and antisemitism that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have perpetrated to Palestinian children for decades. Hamas has brought ruin to the Palestinian cause, to the cause of peace and co-existence. That message must be clear to the entire educated world, and you should lead it. Please consult Dame Richardson and her 2006 book What Terrorists Want. There is much to learn from her.

"Thanks Heather Landi at FierceHealthcare for helping us share our big news: Parsley Health just finalized deals with California and New York insurers that put us in-network for 10 million patients!
As I told Heather in our interview, I started Parsley Health to offer an advanced primary care service that is more aligned, more accessible, and better designed for the way we live our modern lives.
There is a significant primary care gap for women in America""an underserved population that continues to be left behind by our medical system, even though women spend an average of two times as much as men on their healthcare. Women's health started in fertility and fertility benefits""and we need those services. But right now, we're seeing a deep recognition that women's health is more than reproductive health, and that women have diverse health needs that require comprehensive care. Parsley Health is closing the gap in primary care for women and families by creating a medical home base for patients' complex health needs and supporting the whole continuum of care.
Parsley Health's advanced primary care and Root-Cause Resolution Medicine is now in-network for patients in California covered by Aetna CA and Blue Shield of California, and patients in New York covered by Aetna NY, Cigna, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Emblem/HIP, United Healthcare-Freedom, United Healthcare-Oxford, Oscar, UMR Top Tier, and Centivo.
We've also expanded in the enterprise market to service more payers, providers, and self-insured employers to ensure that we're available, affordable, and accessible to the patients that need us most.
This is just the beginning. Big thanks to the incredible Parsley Health team, Carladenise Edwards and our partners that made this happen!

"An article from The Hill shared that the percentage of Americans rating the health care system as excellent or good has fallen below 50% for the first time. To me, this is unsurprising. It's reflective of a steady decline from 62% viewing it that way in 2012. We've continued to see the rising price of health care in the U.S., which reduces the real and perceived value of health insurance. It is erosion like this over time that creates great risks to public health and the entire health care system. This is what keeps me up at night.

"The national shortage of #chemotherapy drugs is a challenge for patients, providers, and plans. OncoHealth's team of #oncology experts is supporting our health plan partners and collaborating with treating oncologists to identify alternative drug strategies for impacted patients. Below is a copy of the letter from our Chief Medical Officer Dr. Andrew Norden outlining our approach to the shortage and what we have been seeing as part of the treatment review process.
Dated June 8, 2023
Dear OncoHealth Health Plan Partner,
As I suspect you are aware, the healthcare industry is facing a nationwide shortage of multiple chemotherapy drugs. Most of these are inexpensive agents including carboplatin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that form the backbone of many commonly used treatment regimens for members with a wide variety of cancer types.
OncoHealth is closely monitoring this situation and working with both our health plan partners and your oncologists to ensure that the best possible treatment is available to members in a timely fashion. The current situation requires more latitude and increased reliance on the clinical judgment of expert oncologists in treatment planning and review of prior authorization requests. We've always gone beyond NCCN when reviewing treatment requests. We continue to rely on that approach and the expertise of our board-certified oncologists, oncology nurses, and oncology pharmacists as we support your providers and members.
When appropriate, we have been collaborating with oncologists to discuss alternative strategies for a drug in shortage such as:
+ Substituting a different generation chemotherapeutic agent within the same class (e.g., oxaliplatin in place of cisplatin or carboplatin).
+ Substituting an oral agent (e.g., capecitabine in place of 5-FU).
+ Omitting one drug from a traditional multi-agent regimen (e.g., omitting carboplatin in three-drug combinations with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer).
We have already received several requests in which oncologists are using these strategies. It is important to be aware that in some cases, the use of an alternative drug in the same class may change the adverse effect profile of the regimen, which requires careful consideration of likely risks and benefits along with close patient monitoring. Similarly, some of the above strategies may increase the cost of the regimen. We are monitoring these potential impacts and engaging with requesting oncologists in a supportive way.
Together with stakeholders across the oncology industry, OncoHealth is advocating for policy interventions that will reduce the frequency of cancer drug shortages going forward, especially regarding low-cost chemotherapeutic drugs that may be overlooked in the marketplace. We will continue to keep you updated on how these shortages are impacting your cancer program, physicians, and members.
Sincerely,
Andrew Norden, MD, MPH, MBA

"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. President Truman""the first presidential champion of Medicare""was in attendance to witness. The program was seen at the time as a major anti-poverty program for older adults. I sometimes think about what President Truman and Johnson would think of the program that they created. This morning, Don Berwick moderated a dialog between me and Rick Gilfillan about the future of the Medicare Advantage program for the IHI Leadership Alliance. I was grateful for a respectful dialog with two mentors I admire and used the opportunity to articulate some changes that I believe will make Medicare Advantage a better program for older adults:
1) Standardized, regulated benefits - plans should compete on quality of administration, not on gimmicky benefits with low utilization rates.
2) Longer enrollment periods - annual enrollment disables a true focus on investing in chronic disease prevention and management
3) Reform of STAR rating program - high star ratings translate into higher payments to plans and higher benefits. Plans have built in disincentives to serve more complex patients and populations because higher star ratings are harder to achieve with more complex populations. 4) New methods for risk adjustment that are aligned with 2023 technologies - CMS should test machine learning models of risk adjustment that iteratively reward plans for true risk rather than expected risk. 5) More clearly articulated clinical requirements - CMS should articulate stronger clincial guidelines around accesss to care to ensure that no corners are caught in the care of patients.
Critics of Medicare Advantare would have us throw the baby out with bath water. It's a complicated program with good actors and bad actors""and unintended consequences. Like every single other health policy. That said, it provides an incredible amount of security to older adults who are on a fixed income""hence its popularity. Traditional Medicare pushes a sizable cost share on to older adults (whose average pretax income is $48,000) who are often unable to bear the expense of copays (20% of most office visits and $1600 for any hospitalization). Traditional Medicare requires literal acts of Congress (Congress!) to introduce new benefits. There was no prescription drug coverage until 2004 (2004!). There is still no vision, dental, or hearing coverage in traditional Medicare. ACOs may lower total costs of care but they do little to lower costs for beneficiary-save reducing their utilization of services some. President Truman and President Johnson wanted a Medicare program that gave older adults financial security and health coverage in their Golden years. Let's keep working to build a better Medicare program and give them that.",Health insurance
"Could the whole Medicare program use a reboot?
Yes.
That's the argument I made at Health Evolution Summit alongside Andy Slavitt (Town Hall Ventures); Karen Ignagni (EmblemHealth) and Richard Merkin (Heritage Provider Network).
""I think we have to think differently about this program and how it can actually serve the needs of older adults. When you think about where the program started and where we are today, we haven't made the kind of leaps in the organization and structure and delivery of care as we have in clinical science. And in the same time that we're talking about CRISPR and gene editing, we're also still talking about fee-for-service Medicare and whether it covers vision services. So when you think about that contrast, I really think the country needs a broader re-imagination of the Medicare program.""",Health insurance
"Prior authorization is one of the most obvious and challenging friction points for patients and clinicians alike.

As a patient myself, I've had very negative personal experiences with prior authorization trying to get needed diagnostic evaluations.

I spoke to Richard Eisenberg at Fortune about the origins of prior authorization and use in the Medicare Advantage program""and how we may get out of it: enlightened regulation; global capitaion and delegation; and physician group self-management of utilization.

"I joined Anjalee Khemlani of Yahoo Finance on her show yesterday to discuss the incursion of retail organizations like Amazon and CVS Health into healthcare delivery with their acquisitions of One Medical and Oak Street Health and Signify Health. I also talked about the growing tension between for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare.
A snippet from our interview:
""But as somebody who runs a nonprofit health care organization, I worry that some of these large entities will put profits before patients. And I think that is a real risk that we have to grapple with. I think the American public is tired of being seen as a profit center when it comes to their health and their wellness.
And so I think that there is an opportunity, actually, for the nonprofit sector to step up and start to try to make some bigger moves.
That's something that we're doing at SCAN. We announced our intention to merge with CareOregon, which is a nonprofit Medicaid-focused health plan in Oregon, and really try to make one plus one equals three to improve the experience for patients because I do think that the American consumer is tired of being seen as a profit center by US health care.""",Health insurance

"Now that the Medicare Advantage advanced rate notice is behind us and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has finalized its rates, I want to share my perspective that competition is broken in Medicare Advantage.

Each year, plans add and subtract benefits creating massive confusion for beneficiaries and herd-like movements to the plans with the most ""attractive"" benefits. Older adults are often dazed and confused""unsure of what to do year after year.

What plans must do (and traditional FFS Medicare for that matter) is align their programs and benefits with the distinctive healthcare needs of older adults.

And what the MA industry must do once and for all is demonstrate real, not marginal, superiority to traditional fee for service Medicare.

Competition should be focused on the excellence demonstrated meeting those needs""NOT just which plans offer the best benefits.

That's why my latest Forbes column argues for standardized benefits in Medicare Advantage and measured excellence in the inflection points in the lives of older adults that are aligned with health risk and potential poor outcomes.

1) plan response to a first-fall or hip fracture
2) a new cancer diagnosis
3) the transition from palliative care to hospice
4) the death of a spouse (h/t to Varun Kumar, MD)

Among others""

CMS""because of legislation introduced by Senator Ron Wyden when he was an early -career Congressman-operates standardized benefits for Medicare supplemental policies. It could do the same for people suffering from particular conditions in Medicare Advantage.

There are many details to be worked out - but the next generation of Medicare Advantage plans should compete on excellence in health outcomes - and nothing else.

""In SCAN, we have found a partner who understands as much as we do that healthcare is local, and that healthcare must be tailored to diverse and traditionally underserved populations. SCAN's focus on historically marginalized communities is the exact mission that ApolloMed was founded to address, and we view SCAN as a partner that can work with us to deliver exceptional healthcare to not only the communities we're based in today but also new regions as we grow together.""
Second, we are thrilled to announce the creation of the Medicare Advantage industry's first women's focused product. Recognizing the central role women play in shaping their families' healthcare decisions, we wanted to deliver a Medicare Advantage experience that offers an additional layer of support. Our ""Inspired"" health plan will connect members with their own women's health advocate, a healthcare professional who can assist members in receiving personalized care. The plan will also offer $0 estrogen therapy, access to fitness facilities and on-demand live streaming fitness; reimbursement for weight management programs; and other benefits. We are thrilled to partner with Cedars-Sinai (thank you Tom Priselac for your partnership!) and other provider partners on this new product offering that we hope will lead others to build customized experiences for women.
Huge kudos to all of the amazing members of the SCAN team who helped launch these efforts with incredible passion for our mission of keeping *ALL* seniors (regardless of their race, culture, or gender) healthy and independent.

"My colleague Eric C. Hunter and I spoke with Robert Traynham, Ph.D. Of AHIP about the journey we have embarked on to bring CareOregon and SCAN together as the HealthRight Group.
We talked about our shared perspectives on healthcare and the David versus Goliath battle in which we are engaged as two not-for-profit plans that aim to serve vulnerable populations in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
We also discussed some of the cultural challenges of the healthcare industry.
An excerpt of our dialog:
Traynham:
A lot of disruptive and innovative thinking. Really appreciate it. What's next for your teams.
Hunter:
You know, I think it's showing truly that this matters, right? Again, performative is not a word that I want to ever have associated with anything that I do. We are meaningful. We are deliberate. We are bold when we need to be, but we're going to show it, we're not just going to talk it. And I think that the plans that we have together to bring new products and ideas into the marketplaces that we're currently in "" or maybe other ones, right "" just saying ""Here's how there are measurable differences in the lives of people. In the health of our communities."" That's going to show that we've done something great, and then hopefully that incentivizes others to want to do the same thing, either individually or with us.
Jain:
But let me maybe just double click on this word ""performative"" because I think we have to talk about what we're really responding to here. I think Eric and I have been in a lot of rooms where people say the right things, but then they walk out of the room, and it's business as usual. And it's what I call the "" inauthenticity crisis in American health care'. Everyone says they want to pay for value. No one wants to actually live in that system. Everyone says, you know, they care about health equity, but when it comes time to making the investments they don't make them. Everyone says they want a diverse leadership team, but when they go to market and try to hire someone, they say ""we can't find diverse candidates."" I mean, we've all been in those rooms and""

"One of my most important mentors and bosses was Rick Gilfillan.
I worked with Rick in the earliest days of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMMI when he was the first director of CMMI.
He taught me so much. And there are few people in healthcare that I respect more.
However, on the subject of Medicare Advantage (MA)""he has it wrong.
Rick believes the program is beyond repair and believes we should blow it up altogether; my preference is that we acknowledge its flaws and fix them.
We had a spirited debate (moderated by Erin Trish""thank you!) on main stage at #HLTH2023 and Paige Minemyer of Fierce Healthcare does a great job capturing it in the below article.",Health insurance
"Years ago, I took care of a woman named ""Brenda"" who was a phone operator at the hospital where I worked. She was admitted to our hospital with uncontrolled hypertension. When I dug into what was going on with her""she was on all the right medications and she had access to the same health plan that I had. She just couldn't afford the high copays. It was heartbreaking. Her health plan covered her expensive hospitalization but the medicines that would keep her out of the hospital out of her reach. It didn't make any sense to me.
I have often used the term ""radical common sense"" to describe what innovation should look like in healthcare. No fancy bells and whistles. Just doing the things for others that we would want for ourselves and our loved ones.
The SCAN pharmacy team took a look at our formulary and recognized that high-cost, high-value drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients were often put out of their reach.
And in an act of ""radical common sense,"" they proposed adding a new tier to our pharmacy benefits ahead of CMS negotiating drug prices.
Our new tier 6 will cover popular drugs like Eliquis, Xarelto, Jardiance, Januvia, and Entresto at $0 or $11 copays depending on the product. These are many of the same drugs that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be negotiating on behalf of all beneficiaries as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In a time when plans are adding some ""nice to have benefits""""we are focusing on the things that matter most to Medicare beneficiaries and their ability to remain healthy and independent.
Thanks to our great pharmacy team for their ""radical common sense"" and for Axios reporter Maya Goldman for sharing our story.",Health insurance

"At HealthHelp, provider education and collaboration serve as the foundation of our benefits management process. These ideals are embedded within our mission and values, and inform every aspect of our relationship with physician offices.
Our consultative approach to prior authorization that presents clinical best practices and the latest guidelines in a collaborative fashion has helped drive a NPS of 57 with provider office staff versus the industry average of 18.

"HealthHelp's NPS of 57 with ordering physicians and their staff can also serve as a predictor of a member's overall satisfaction with their insurer.
Throughout the specialty benefits management process, the safety and well-being of the patient is always consideration number one. HealthHelp also recognizes that the member's overall satisfaction with their experience, and ultimately with their health insurer, is influenced heavily by the interaction between their physician and the payer.
This is where prior authorization can muddy the relationship. A traditional, denial based Utilization Management model can be challenging for a physician to navigate. The potentially negative experience of obtaining a prior authorization can trickle down to the conversation between the patient and their physician's office. Its during the course of this conversation that the ordering physician's frustration is transferred to the member.

""If something that should have been approved doesn't get approved, there's a delay in care. That provider also has to go through an appeals process. There's extra work for that provider and a delay, both which ultimately affect the member. The value of the HealthHelp model is that we invest in the front-end to eliminate the chance that a request may not be approved.
The collaborative educational component of the HealthHelp specialty programs work to not only benefit the health plan and its contracted providers but really the member.""

"Oh well.. Might as well ask ChatGPT about Prior Auth....
Prior auth can be a pain,
But it's crucial for our gain,
To ensure coverage and avoid strain,
Let's streamline the process, let's refrain.
No more delays or endless wait,
Let's make sure we communicate,
With insurers, to mitigate,
Any hurdles, before it's too late.
Let's work together, hand in hand,
To make sure our patients get the care they demand,
With prior auth on our side,
We'll make sure no patient is denied.
