"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFor early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAdditionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
At HealthHelp, our evidence-based guidelines prioritize what's best for the patient. By staying up-to-date with the latest research and medical practices, we ensure that every decision made is in the best interest of the patient's well-being. Our radiation oncology program is based on physician collaboration and education. This includes our proactive specialist outreach that allows ordering physicians the opportunity to connect with practicing peers at leading cancer centers to discuss treatment pans that maximize patient outcomes.

"As I consider the future of the tax profession, diversity continues to be a top priority. Creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce is mission critical, and leaders √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú myself included √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú need to prioritize tangible solutions that create more opportunities for diverse talent to enter and succeed in our profession. A more balanced workforce ultimately leads to an improved culture and more profitable business. Today, KPMG US launched its 2023 Impact Report sharing the many strides we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve made as a firm and practice in support of our people and planet. The report is one more great example of our commitment to diversity, transparency, culture, sustainable practices and our principles. In Tax specifically, one tangible example of our commitment to diversity is our recently launched Tax Scholarship Program. The program is designed to enable individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to further their studies at a school of their choice and grants up to $40K in funding to eligible students, giving them access to the vast KPMG Tax network, including mentors, coaches, internship opportunities and more.
Below are just a few more examples of ways KPMG is working to expand our diversity, as outlined in the report: - Rehires have increased year over year, especially for those from underrepresented backgrounds - 49% of new hires identify as part of an underrepresented racial/ethnic group - Over two-thirds of our FY23 promotion class are from underrepresented backgrounds. To learn more about how a continued investment in our people has been fundamental to our success as a firm, I hope you'll read through this latest Impact Report. While there's always more work to do, we have much to be proud of and I'm looking forward to continuing our important work #Together.

"August 14 may be #FinancialAwarenessDay, but there rarely goes a day in my life where I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not talking about, in some way or another, the importance of financial health √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù especially for women.
We built Ellevest because we believe that your financial health is connected intrinsically with your overall health. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not just about dollars and cents √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s about having control over your life, your choices, and your future.
Deciding you want to take control of your money is the easy part. The tricky part can be figuring out how. It starts with establishing an essential set of habits and practices that create the lasting financial security and stability you need to design, build, and live the life you want. That includes checking in on your finances regularly, budgeting for spending *and* debt, investing a part of every paycheck, keeping a healthy emergency fund, and having an overall financial plan in place.
What difference does this all make?
Research shows that people with a financial plan have 3x the net worth of those who don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. Triple the wealth!
And for women, the difference is compounded √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù because we start out with less than men, have fewer financial opportunities than men, and end up with less than men.
These gender gaps can be crippling: Women are more likely to end up in poverty in retirement than men.
So if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel in control of your finances yet, today√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good day to start. Start investing, start budgeting, start planning √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù and if you need some expert help √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ well, you know where to go:

"Compiled by Vatan H√É¬ºzeir, the latest cache of internal documents describing Big Oil's concealed knowledge of global warming is a gold mine.
One bombshell is a confidential Shell scenario report from 1989 which imagined two futures: SUSTAINABLE WORLD and GLOBAL MERCANTILISM.
In SUSTAINABLE WORLD, greenhouse gas emissions would peak around the year 2000 and decline rapidly thereafter, and total CO2 concentrations would be limited to 400 ppm. GLOBAL MERCANTILISM, on the other hand, would see emissions continue to rise (this is the path we're on).
What would the world be like under GLOBAL MERCANTILISM (the path we're on)? According to Shell, ""There would be more violent weather - more storms, more droughts, more deluges. Mean sea level would rise at least 30 cm. Agricultural patterns would be most dramatically changed. Something as simple as a moderate change in rainfall pattern disrupts eco-systems, and many species of trees, plants, animals and insects would not be able to move and adapt.""
""The changes would, however, most impact on humans,"" Shell
went on. ""In earlier times, man was able to respond with his feet. Today, there is no place to go because people already stand there. Perhaps those in industrial countries could cope with a rise in sea level (the Dutch example) but for poor countries such defences are not possible.""
""The potential refugee problem in GLOBAL MERCANTILISM could be unprecedented,"" Shell predicted. ""Africans would push into Europe, Chinese into the Soviet Union, Latins into the United States, Indonesians into Australia. Boundaries would count for little - overwhelmed by the numbers. Conflicts would abound. Civilization could prove a fragile thing. The logic of SUSTAINABLE WORLD is a society choosing to channel some investments into environmental maintenance against this contingency.""
And yet despite these predictions, Shell chose to push the world into the high-carbon scenario it knew would be so disastrous.
The company spent the next decade denying the existence of global warming through disinformation groups like the Global Climate Coalition. And then spent the last two decades giving false reassurances that it's moving away from fossil fuels, all while actually expanding its fossil fuel business and blocking the fossil fuel controls it knows are needed to avoid irreversible global damage.
Other nuggets from Shell's document:
- admits the ""principal source"" of CO2 is ""fossil fuel combustion""
- notes methane a powerful greenhouse gas about 25 times more potent than CO2
- foreshadows the use of offsets to enable more fossil fuel use
This document underscores the fact that Shell and the broader fossil fuel industry had a choice and knowingly chose global disaster in exchange for short term profits.

"Letter to Harvard University President Gay:
Dear President Gay:
I am an alumnus of Harvard College 1992, Government. My tutor and thesis advisor was Dame Louise Richardson, who I am sure you know went on to be the head of Oxford and whose academic scholarship is on terrorism. I am also an Israeli citizen and reside in Israel for the past 20 years. This week, my best friends lost their son fighting Hamas terrorists, another colleague lost his elderly parent to Hamas butchery and friends have a son who attended the rave party, was severely wounded and is held in Gaza by Hamas. There were 13 funerals in my relatively small city Ra√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢anana this week alone.
I am deeply troubled by what is missing in your statements around these terrorist events. You condemn the Hamas barbarism, but you speak mostly about listening to each other in the Harvard community. While that is important, now is a time for you as the leader of Harvard to speak much more clearly and forcefully against terror. Harvard does not only exist to foster dialogue among its students. Harvard√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alumni and students, certainly of the Government department and the Law, Business and Kennedy Schools, are and will be leaders of governments, corporations, international organizations, etc. Harvard√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mission is to create actors, not only talkers, on the world stage as a force for good.
In order to do this, as Harvard√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s leader you must speak more forcefully and unequivocally. Not just to condemn the barbarism. Your message should be clear and unequivocal, not just to support Israeli victims, but to SAVE GAZA AND THE PALESTINIANS FROM HAMAS! Hamas√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s horrific crimes against Israelis this week and over the years are secondary only to their horrific crimes against their own people since their founding. They have singlehandedly (alongside Islamic Jihad) and too effectively prolonged the Palestinian Israeli conflict, wreaked death and destruction among their people all while profiting √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú be it in capital for their leadership or murderous suicide missions for their nihilistic ideology. They threaten to drag the world into a global conflict. This is all historical truth, not perspective. Harvard must stand for truth.
Palestinians who say that Hamas represent them have made a clear choice √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú they choose and support terrorism - that Harvard must reject. You can make a difference if you are clearer about the University√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s position. This is a time for moral clarity to prevail. Harvard is a bastion of education. Harvard leadership should be screaming from the top of its lungs √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú end the education of hate and antisemitism that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have perpetrated to Palestinian children for decades. Hamas has brought ruin to the Palestinian cause, to the cause of peace and co-existence. That message must be clear to the entire educated world, and you should lead it. Please consult Dame Richardson and her 2006 book What Terrorists Want. There is much to learn from her.
