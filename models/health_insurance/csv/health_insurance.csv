"Thanks Heather Landi at FierceHealthcare for helping us share our big news: Parsley Health just finalized deals with California and New York insurers that put us in-network for 10 million patients!
As I told Heather in our interview, I started Parsley Health to offer an advanced primary care service that is more aligned, more accessible, and better designed for the way we live our modern lives.
There is a significant primary care gap for women in Americaâ€”an underserved population that continues to be left behind by our medical system, even though women spend an average of two times as much as men on their healthcare. Women's health started in fertility and fertility benefitsâ€”and we need those services. But right now, weâ€™re seeing a deep recognition that women's health is more than reproductive health, and that women have diverse health needs that require comprehensive care. Parsley Health is closing the gap in primary care for women and families by creating a medical home base for patientsâ€™ complex health needs and supporting the whole continuum of care.
Parsley Healthâ€™s advanced primary care and Root-Cause Resolution Medicine is now in-network for patients in California covered by Aetna CA and Blue Shield of California, and patients in New York covered by Aetna NY, Cigna, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Emblem/HIP, United Healthcare-Freedom, United Healthcare-Oxford, Oscar, UMR Top Tier, and Centivo.
Weâ€™ve also expanded in the enterprise market to service more payers, providers, and self-insured employers to ensure that weâ€™re available, affordable, and accessible to the patients that need us most.
This is just the beginning. Big thanks to the incredible Parsley Health team, Carladenise Edwards and our partners that made this happen!

"The integration of technology and AI in healthcare insurance is not only a pathway to efficiency but also a catalyst for innovative service delivery. Mario Schlosser, CEO and co-founder of Oscar Health, shares with a16z's Julie Yoo how to improve efficiency and real-time data integration in today's dynamic healthcare environment: ðŸ”¹ Digital Integration: Building an insurance company from scratch today would significantly benefit from a digital framework right from the onset. From claims processing to customer service, digitization ensures real-time data insights and decision-making.
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning & AI: These technologies could automate and make healthcare insurance processes faster and more efficient. They can assist in summarizing lab test results, automating care journeys, and even predicting the best care pathways for individuals.
ðŸ”¹ Individual-Centric Plans: The idea of developing benefit-less benefit designs where the plan learns and adapts to individual utilization patterns could be a game-changer. It could lead to more personalized, cost-effective insurance plans.

"An article from The Hill shared that the percentage of Americans rating the health care system as excellent or good has fallen below 50% for the first time. To me, this is unsurprising. Itâ€™s reflective of a steady decline from 62% viewing it that way in 2012. Weâ€™ve continued to see the rising price of health care in the U.S., which reduces the real and perceived value of health insurance. It is erosion like this over time that creates great risks to public health and the entire health care system. This is what keeps me up at night.

"The national shortage of #chemotherapy drugs is a challenge for patients, providers, and plans. OncoHealthâ€™s team of #oncology experts is supporting our health plan partners and collaborating with treating oncologists to identify alternative drug strategies for impacted patients. Below is a copy of the letter from our Chief Medical Officer Dr. Andrew Norden outlining our approach to the shortage and what we have been seeing as part of the treatment review process.
Dated June 8, 2023
Dear OncoHealth Health Plan Partner,
As I suspect you are aware, the healthcare industry is facing a nationwide shortage of multiple chemotherapy drugs. Most of these are inexpensive agents including carboplatin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that form the backbone of many commonly used treatment regimens for members with a wide variety of cancer types.
OncoHealth is closely monitoring this situation and working with both our health plan partners and your oncologists to ensure that the best possible treatment is available to members in a timely fashion. The current situation requires more latitude and increased reliance on the clinical judgment of expert oncologists in treatment planning and review of prior authorization requests. Weâ€™ve always gone beyond NCCN when reviewing treatment requests. We continue to rely on that approach and the expertise of our board-certified oncologists, oncology nurses, and oncology pharmacists as we support your providers and members.
When appropriate, we have been collaborating with oncologists to discuss alternative strategies for a drug in shortage such as:
+ Substituting a different generation chemotherapeutic agent within the same class (e.g., oxaliplatin in place of cisplatin or carboplatin).
+ Substituting an oral agent (e.g., capecitabine in place of 5-FU).
+ Omitting one drug from a traditional multi-agent regimen (e.g., omitting carboplatin in three-drug combinations with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer).
We have already received several requests in which oncologists are using these strategies. It is important to be aware that in some cases, the use of an alternative drug in the same class may change the adverse effect profile of the regimen, which requires careful consideration of likely risks and benefits along with close patient monitoring. Similarly, some of the above strategies may increase the cost of the regimen. We are monitoring these potential impacts and engaging with requesting oncologists in a supportive way.
Together with stakeholders across the oncology industry, OncoHealth is advocating for policy interventions that will reduce the frequency of cancer drug shortages going forward, especially regarding low-cost chemotherapeutic drugs that may be overlooked in the marketplace. We will continue to keep you updated on how these shortages are impacting your cancer program, physicians, and members.
Sincerely,
Andrew Norden, MD, MPH, MBA

"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. President Trumanâ€”the first presidential champion of Medicareâ€”was in attendance to witness. The program was seen at the time as a major anti-poverty program for older adults. I sometimes think about what President Truman and Johnson would think of the program that they created. This morning, Don Berwick moderated a dialog between me and Rick Gilfillan about the future of the Medicare Advantage program for the IHI Leadership Alliance. I was grateful for a respectful dialog with two mentors I admire and used the opportunity to articulate some changes that I believe will make Medicare Advantage a better program for older adults:
1) Standardized, regulated benefits - plans should compete on quality of administration, not on gimmicky benefits with low utilization rates.
2) Longer enrollment periods - annual enrollment disables a true focus on investing in chronic disease prevention and management
3) Reform of STAR rating program - high star ratings translate into higher payments to plans and higher benefits. Plans have built in disincentives to serve more complex patients and populations because higher star ratings are harder to achieve with more complex populations. 4) New methods for risk adjustment that are aligned with 2023 technologies - CMS should test machine learning models of risk adjustment that iteratively reward plans for true risk rather than expected risk. 5) More clearly articulated clinical requirements - CMS should articulate stronger clincial guidelines around accesss to care to ensure that no corners are caught in the care of patients.
Critics of Medicare Advantare would have us throw the baby out with bath water. Itâ€™s a complicated program with good actors and bad actorsâ€”and unintended consequences. Like every single other health policy. That said, it provides an incredible amount of security to older adults who are on a fixed incomeâ€”hence its popularity. Traditional Medicare pushes a sizable cost share on to older adults (whose average pretax income is $48,000) who are often unable to bear the expense of copays (20% of most office visits and $1600 for any hospitalization). Traditional Medicare requires literal acts of Congress (Congress!) to introduce new benefits. There was no prescription drug coverage until 2004 (2004!). There is still no vision, dental, or hearing coverage in traditional Medicare. ACOs may lower total costs of care but they do little to lower costs for beneficiary-save reducing their utilization of services some. President Truman and President Johnson wanted a Medicare program that gave older adults financial security and health coverage in their Golden years. Letâ€™s keep working to build a better Medicare program and give them that.",Health Insurance
"Could the whole Medicare program use a reboot?
Yes.
Thatâ€™s the argument I made at Health Evolution Summit alongside Andy Slavitt (Town Hall Ventures); Karen Ignagni (EmblemHealth) and Richard Merkin (Heritage Provider Network).
â€œI think we have to think differently about this program and how it can actually serve the needs of older adults. When you think about where the program started and where we are today, we havenâ€™t made the kind of leaps in the organization and structure and delivery of care as we have in clinical science. And in the same time that weâ€™re talking about CRISPR and gene editing, weâ€™re also still talking about fee-for-service Medicare and whether it covers vision services. So when you think about that contrast, I really think the country needs a broader re-imagination of the Medicare program.â€",Health Insurance
"Prior authorization is one of the most obvious and challenging friction points for patients and clinicians alike.

As a patient myself, Iâ€™ve had very negative personal experiences with prior authorization trying to get needed diagnostic evaluations.

I spoke to Richard Eisenberg at Fortune about the origins of prior authorization and use in the Medicare Advantage programâ€”and how we may get out of it: enlightened regulation; global capitaion and delegation; and physician group self-management of utilization.

All three will be necessary to get out of the administrative waste nightmare that has befallen the medical profession.

-Can you tell us about a few trends you see in Medicare and how those may impact operators of senior housing?
-As one of the nationâ€™s largest not-for-profit Medicare Advantage plans, SCAN â€™s mission is to keep seniors healthy and independent.â€¯Can you tell us about your organization and its mission?â€¯
-How can senior housing operators partner with value-based care and Medicare Advantage plans?
-Recently, there has been criticism of Medicare Advantage plans.â€¯Is that criticism likely to slow the growth of movement by seniors to MA plans? â€¯

"I joined Anjalee Khemlani of Yahoo Finance on her show yesterday to discuss the incursion of retail organizations like Amazon and CVS Health into healthcare delivery with their acquisitions of One Medical and Oak Street Health and Signify Health. I also talked about the growing tension between for-profit and not-for-profit healthcare.
A snippet from our interview:
""But as somebody who runs a nonprofit health care organization, I worry that some of these large entities will put profits before patients. And I think that is a real risk that we have to grapple with. I think the American public is tired of being seen as a profit center when it comes to their health and their wellness.
And so I think that there is an opportunity, actually, for the nonprofit sector to step up and start to try to make some bigger moves.
That's something that we're doing at SCAN. We announced our intention to merge with CareOregon, which is a nonprofit Medicaid-focused health plan in Oregon, and really try to make one plus one equals three to improve the experience for patients because I do think that the American consumer is tired of being seen as a profit center by US health care.""",Health Insurance
"I joined Don Berwick and Dr. Kedar Mate on their IHI â€œTurn the Lights on podcast.

"Iâ€™m looking forward to discussing the future of Medicare Advantage at the upcoming Medicare Advantage Summit alongside Tom Priselac, Zeke Emanuel, Mark McClellan, Seema Verma, and Alan Weil.

"Now that the Medicare Advantage advanced rate notice is behind us and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has finalized its rates, I want to share my perspective that competition is broken in Medicare Advantage.

Each year, plans add and subtract benefits creating massive confusion for beneficiaries and herd-like movements to the plans with the most â€œattractiveâ€ benefits. Older adults are often dazed and confusedâ€”unsure of what to do year after year.

What plans must do (and traditional FFS Medicare for that matter) is align their programs and benefits with the distinctive healthcare needs of older adults.

And what the MA industry must do once and for all is demonstrate real, not marginal, superiority to traditional fee for service Medicare.

Competition should be focused on the excellence demonstrated meeting those needsâ€”NOT just which plans offer the best benefits.

Thatâ€™s why my latest Forbes column argues for standardized benefits in Medicare Advantage and measured excellence in the inflection points in the lives of older adults that are aligned with health risk and potential poor outcomes.

1) plan response to a first-fall or hip fracture
2) a new cancer diagnosis
3) the transition from palliative care to hospice
4) the death of a spouse (h/t to Varun Kumar, MD)

Among othersâ€¦

CMSâ€”because of legislation introduced by Senator Ron Wyden when he was an early -career Congressman-operates standardized benefits for Medicare supplemental policies. It could do the same for people suffering from particular conditions in Medicare Advantage.

There are many details to be worked out - but the next generation of Medicare Advantage plans should compete on excellence in health outcomes - and nothing else.

â€œWe have a health care system and we have a Medicare program that I think has not necessarily been designed to support people during those inflection points,â€ he says, explaining how the federal program for older adults is no longer relevant to the needs of current patients.

"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services finalized its annual rate notice and set the stage for a phased-in approach to cuts in Medicare Advantage revenue. I shared my perspective on the final rate notice; potential political implications; and the future of the program with Anjalee Khemlani of Yahoo Finance.

With more than 50% of older adults now enrolled in Medicare Advantage, what do you think is in store for the future of Managed Medicare?",Health Insurance
"The Medicare program was originally signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson as a program that paid medical bills for older adults.
Today, the program is slowly reorienting towards promoting and preserving healthâ€”but not quickly enough.
Should we rethink the Medicare program? I believe we should.
We are lost in zero sum arguments about whether fee-for-service Medicare is better than Medicare Advantage or vice versa.
The reality isâ€”both can and should be better. And, in fact, we should be dreaming bigger and thinking about how to build a Medicare program for the future.
I shared my thoughts with Jim Parker of Hospice News.",Health Insurance
"I was excited to join Vivien Ho on her Pear VC podcast.
We had a wide-ranging conversation on SCAN and the future of the healthcare industry.
Some snippets from our dialog:
â€œOne of the biggest problems we have in healthcare is that most healthcare entrepreneurs donâ€™t need healthcare and donâ€™t realize how dystopic some of the things that theyâ€™re creating areâ€” until they actually need them on the other side of things.â€
â€œI think we have an authenticity problem in healthcare. Everyone starts out with the greatest intent to drive the most change, and then before long, the pressures start to circulate around you and youâ€™re just trying to survive, and then you build something thatâ€™s just as mediocre as the things that youâ€™re trying to replace.â€
â€œWeâ€™ve normalized the abnormal in the Medicare Advantage industry, and we've normalized the abnormal in health care more broadly. The opportunity for us is to try to simplify things on behalf of seniors.â€

"It was thrilling that Nasdaq today shared the news about SCANâ€™s planned combination with CareOregon and the formation of the HealthRight Group on its iconic Times Square billboard.
The underlying intent of the combination is simple:
To improve care for frail and vulnerable populations of all kinds.
As a not-for-profit platform, HealthRight aims to inspire change in a healthcare industry that more often than not puts profit and quarterly earnings before the people that is charged to serve.
SCANâ€™s strength is in the Medicare program, where we have 6 years straight of 4.5 Star performance (a feat accomplished by only 2 other plans in the country).
CareOregonâ€™s strength is in the Medicaid program where it has received national accolades for its patient-centered approach to serving the physical and behavioral health needs of people that society has too often forgotten.
Together, HealthRight will exceed $6.8B in revenues and 3000 employees and serve more than 800,000 people.
We simply canâ€™t wait to get started together!",Health Insurance
"We are excited to announce our two major efforts (among many more) going into this yearâ€™s annual enrollment:
First, we are thrilled to announce a 10-year partnership with ApolloMed on a collaborative new health plan that is focused on serving minority communities through differentiated benefits. ApolloMed is one of the premier healthcare provider organizations comprised of independent and employed physiciansâ€”and will work together with us to build tailored, culturally competent benefits and services for its large population of Asian-American, Hispanic, and African-American patients. In the words of their co-CEO Brandon Sim:
â€œIn SCAN, we have found a partner who understands as much as we do that healthcare is local, and that healthcare must be tailored to diverse and traditionally underserved populations. SCANâ€™s focus on historically marginalized communities is the exact mission that ApolloMed was founded to address, and we view SCAN as a partner that can work with us to deliver exceptional healthcare to not only the communities weâ€™re based in today but also new regions as we grow together.â€
Second, we are thrilled to announce the creation of the Medicare Advantage industryâ€™s first womenâ€™s focused product. Recognizing the central role women play in shaping their familiesâ€™ healthcare decisions, we wanted to deliver a Medicare Advantage experience that offers an additional layer of support. Our â€œInspiredâ€ health plan will connect members with their own womenâ€™s health advocate, a healthcare professional who can assist members in receiving personalized care. The plan will also offer $0 estrogen therapy, access to fitness facilities and on-demand live streaming fitness; reimbursement for weight management programs; and other benefits. We are thrilled to partner with Cedars-Sinai (thank you Tom Priselac for your partnership!) and other provider partners on this new product offering that we hope will lead others to build customized experiences for women.

"My colleague Eric C. Hunter and I spoke with Robert Traynham, Ph.D. Of AHIP about the journey we have embarked on to bring CareOregon and SCAN together as the HealthRight Group.
We talked about our shared perspectives on healthcare and the David versus Goliath battle in which we are engaged as two not-for-profit plans that aim to serve vulnerable populations in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
We also discussed some of the cultural challenges of the healthcare industry.
An excerpt of our dialog:
Traynham:
A lot of disruptive and innovative thinking. Really appreciate it. Whatâ€™s next for your teams.
Hunter:
You know, I think it's showing truly that this matters, right? Again, performative is not a word that I want to ever have associated with anything that I do. We are meaningful. We are deliberate. We are bold when we need to be, but we're going to show it, we're not just going to talk it. And I think that the plans that we have together to bring new products and ideas into the marketplaces that we're currently in â€” or maybe other ones, right â€” just saying â€œHere's how there are measurable differences in the lives of people. In the health of our communities.â€ That's going to show that we've done something great, and then hopefully that incentivizes others to want to do the same thing, either individually or with us.
Jain:
But let me maybe just double click on this word â€œperformativeâ€ because I think we have to talk about what we're really responding to here. I think Eric and I have been in a lot of rooms where people say the right things, but then they walk out of the room, and it's business as usual. And it's what I call the â€˜inauthenticity crisis in American health careâ€™. Everyone says they want to pay for value. No one wants to actually live in that system. Everyone says, you know, they care about health equity, but when it comes time to making the investments they don't make them. Everyone says they want a diverse leadership team, but when they go to market and try to hire someone, they say â€œwe can't find diverse candidates.â€ I mean, we've all been in those rooms andâ€¦

"One of my most important mentors and bosses was Rick Gilfillan.
I worked with Rick in the earliest days of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMMI when he was the first director of CMMI.
He taught me so much. And there are few people in healthcare that I respect more.
However, on the subject of Medicare Advantage (MA)â€”he has it wrong.
Rick believes the program is beyond repair and believes we should blow it up altogether; my preference is that we acknowledge its flaws and fix them.
We had a spirited debate (moderated by Erin Trishâ€”thank you!) on main stage at #HLTH2023 and Paige Minemyer of Fierce Healthcare does a great job capturing it in the below article.",Health Insurance
"Years ago, I took care of a woman named â€œBrendaâ€ who was a phone operator at the hospital where I worked. She was admitted to our hospital with uncontrolled hypertension. When I dug into what was going on with herâ€”she was on all the right medications and she had access to the same health plan that I had. She just couldnâ€™t afford the high copays. It was heartbreaking. Her health plan covered her expensive hospitalization but the medicines that would keep her out of the hospital out of her reach. It didnâ€™t make any sense to me.
I have often used the term â€œradical common senseâ€ to describe what innovation should look like in healthcare. No fancy bells and whistles. Just doing the things for others that we would want for ourselves and our loved ones.
The SCAN pharmacy team took a look at our formulary and recognized that high-cost, high-value drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients were often put out of their reach.
And in an act of â€œradical common sense,â€ they proposed adding a new tier to our pharmacy benefits ahead of CMS negotiating drug prices.
Our new tier 6 will cover popular drugs like Eliquis, Xarelto, Jardiance, Januvia, and Entresto at $0 or $11 copays depending on the product. These are many of the same drugs that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be negotiating on behalf of all beneficiaries as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.
In a time when plans are adding some â€œnice to have benefitsâ€â€”we are focusing on the things that matter most to Medicare beneficiaries and their ability to remain healthy and independent.
