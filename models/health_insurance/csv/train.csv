"The national shortage of #chemotherapy drugs is a challenge for patients, providers, and plans. OncoHealth's team of #oncology experts is supporting our health plan partners and collaborating with treating oncologists to identify alternative drug strategies for impacted patients. Below is a copy of the letter from our Chief Medical Officer Dr. Andrew Norden outlining our approach to the shortage and what we have been seeing as part of the treatment review process.
Dated June 8, 2023
Dear OncoHealth Health Plan Partner,
As I suspect you are aware, the healthcare industry is facing a nationwide shortage of multiple chemotherapy drugs. Most of these are inexpensive agents including carboplatin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that form the backbone of many commonly used treatment regimens for members with a wide variety of cancer types.
OncoHealth is closely monitoring this situation and working with both our health plan partners and your oncologists to ensure that the best possible treatment is available to members in a timely fashion. The current situation requires more latitude and increased reliance on the clinical judgment of expert oncologists in treatment planning and review of prior authorization requests. We've always gone beyond NCCN when reviewing treatment requests. We continue to rely on that approach and the expertise of our board-certified oncologists, oncology nurses, and oncology pharmacists as we support your providers and members.
When appropriate, we have been collaborating with oncologists to discuss alternative strategies for a drug in shortage such as:
+ Substituting a different generation chemotherapeutic agent within the same class (e.g., oxaliplatin in place of cisplatin or carboplatin).
+ Substituting an oral agent (e.g., capecitabine in place of 5-FU).
+ Omitting one drug from a traditional multi-agent regimen (e.g., omitting carboplatin in three-drug combinations with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer).
We have already received several requests in which oncologists are using these strategies. It is important to be aware that in some cases, the use of an alternative drug in the same class may change the adverse effect profile of the regimen, which requires careful consideration of likely risks and benefits along with close patient monitoring. Similarly, some of the above strategies may increase the cost of the regimen. We are monitoring these potential impacts and engaging with requesting oncologists in a supportive way.
Together with stakeholders across the oncology industry, OncoHealth is advocating for policy interventions that will reduce the frequency of cancer drug shortages going forward, especially regarding low-cost chemotherapeutic drugs that may be overlooked in the marketplace. We will continue to keep you updated on how these shortages are impacting your cancer program, physicians, and members.
Sincerely,
Andrew Norden, MD, MPH, MBA

Her health plan covered her expensive hospitalization but the medicines that would keep her out of the hospital out of her reach. It didn't make any sense to me.
I have often used the term ""radical common sense"" to describe what innovation should look like in healthcare. No fancy bells and whistles. Just doing the things for others that we would want for ourselves and our loved ones.
The SCAN pharmacy team took a look at our formulary and recognized that high-cost, high-value drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients were often put out of their reach.
And in an act of ""radical common sense,"" they proposed adding a new tier to our pharmacy benefits ahead of CMS negotiating drug prices.
Our new tier 6 will cover popular drugs like Eliquis, Xarelto, Jardiance, Januvia, and Entresto at $0 or $11 copays depending on the product. These are many of the same drugs that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be negotiating on behalf of all beneficiaries as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

As I told Heather in our interview, I started Parsley Health to offer an advanced primary care service that is more aligned, more accessible, and better designed for the way we live our modern lives.
There is a significant primary care gap for women in America""an underserved population that continues to be left behind by our medical system, even though women spend an average of two times as much as men on their healthcare. Women's health started in fertility and fertility benefits""and we need those services. But right now, we're seeing a deep recognition that women's health is more than reproductive health, and that women have diverse health needs that require comprehensive care. Parsley Health is closing the gap in primary care for women and families by creating a medical home base for patients' complex health needs and supporting the whole continuum of care.
Parsley Health's advanced primary care and Root-Cause Resolution Medicine is now in-network for patients in California covered by Aetna CA and Blue Shield of California, and patients in New York covered by Aetna NY, Cigna, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Emblem/HIP, United Healthcare-Freedom, United Healthcare-Oxford, Oscar, UMR Top Tier, and Centivo.
We've also expanded in the enterprise market to service more payers, providers, and self-insured employers to ensure that we're available, affordable, and accessible to the patients that need us most.

"Could the whole Medicare program use a reboot?
Yes.
That's the argument I made at Health Evolution Summit alongside Andy Slavitt (Town Hall Ventures); Karen Ignagni (EmblemHealth) and Richard Merkin (Heritage Provider Network).
""I think we have to think differently about this program and how it can actually serve the needs of older adults. When you think about where the program started and where we are today, we haven't made the kind of leaps in the organization and structure and delivery of care as we have in clinical science. And in the same time that we're talking about CRISPR and gene editing, we're also still talking about fee-for-service Medicare and whether it covers vision services.

"Compiled by Vatan HA14zeir, the latest cache of internal documents describing Big Oil's concealed knowledge of global warming is a gold mine.
One bombshell is a confidential Shell scenario report from 1989 which imagined two futures: SUSTAINABLE WORLD and GLOBAL MERCANTILISM.
In SUSTAINABLE WORLD, greenhouse gas emissions would peak around the year 2000 and decline rapidly thereafter, and total CO2 concentrations would be limited to 400 ppm. GLOBAL MERCANTILISM, on the other hand, would see emissions continue to rise (this is the path we're on).
What would the world be like under GLOBAL MERCANTILISM (the path we're on)? According to Shell, ""There would be more violent weather - more storms, more droughts, more deluges. Mean sea level would rise at least 30 cm. Agricultural patterns would be most dramatically changed. Something as simple as a moderate change in rainfall pattern disrupts eco-systems, and many species of trees, plants, animals and insects would not be able to move and adapt.""
""The changes would, however, most impact on humans,"" Shell
went on. ""In earlier times, man was able to respond with his feet. Today, there is no place to go because people already stand there. Perhaps those in industrial countries could cope with a rise in sea level (the Dutch example) but for poor countries such defences are not possible.""
""The potential refugee problem in GLOBAL MERCANTILISM could be unprecedented,"" Shell predicted. ""Africans would push into Europe, Chinese into the Soviet Union, Latins into the United States, Indonesians into Australia. Boundaries would count for little - overwhelmed by the numbers. Conflicts would abound. Civilization could prove a fragile thing. The logic of SUSTAINABLE WORLD is a society choosing to channel some investments into environmental maintenance against this contingency.""
And yet despite these predictions, Shell chose to push the world into the high-carbon scenario it knew would be so disastrous.
The company spent the next decade denying the existence of global warming through disinformation groups like the Global Climate Coalition. And then spent the last two decades giving false reassurances that it's moving away from fossil fuels, all while actually expanding its fossil fuel business and blocking the fossil fuel controls it knows are needed to avoid irreversible global damage.
Other nuggets from Shell's document:
- admits the ""principal source"" of CO2 is ""fossil fuel combustion""
- notes methane a powerful greenhouse gas about 25 times more potent than CO2
- foreshadows the use of offsets to enable more fossil fuel use
This document underscores the fact that Shell and the broader fossil fuel industry had a choice and knowingly chose global disaster in exchange for short term profits.

"Now that the Medicare Advantage advanced rate notice is behind us and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has finalized its rates, I want to share my perspective that competition is broken in Medicare Advantage.

Each year, plans add and subtract benefits creating massive confusion for beneficiaries and herd-like movements to the plans with the most ""attractive"" benefits. Older adults are often dazed and confused""unsure of what to do year after year.

What plans must do (and traditional FFS Medicare for that matter) is align their programs and benefits with the distinctive healthcare needs of older adults.

And what the MA industry must do once and for all is demonstrate real, not marginal, superiority to traditional fee for service Medicare.

Competition should be focused on the excellence demonstrated meeting those needs""NOT just which plans offer the best benefits.

That's why my latest Forbes column argues for standardized benefits in Medicare Advantage and measured excellence in the inflection points in the lives of older adults that are aligned with health risk and potential poor outcomes.

CMS""because of legislation introduced by Senator Ron Wyden when he was an early -career Congressman-operates standardized benefits for Medicare supplemental policies. It could do the same for people suffering from particular conditions in Medicare Advantage.

There are many details to be worked out - but the next generation of Medicare Advantage plans should compete on excellence in health outcomes - and nothing else.

What do you think?",Health insurance
"Thirty years ago, Highmark enrolled the first Pennsylvania child in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which spawned a national program. Now, as some coverage is set to change as a result of the public health emergency unwinding, the CHIP program will be more crucial in providing families coverage now and into the future.",Health insurance
"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. President Truman""the first presidential champion of Medicare""was in attendance to witness. The program was seen at the time as a major anti-poverty program for older adults. I sometimes think about what President Truman and Johnson would think of the program that they created. This morning, Don Berwick moderated a dialog between me and Rick Gilfillan about the future of the Medicare Advantage program for the IHI Leadership Alliance. I was grateful for a respectful dialog with two mentors I admire and used the opportunity to articulate some changes that I believe will make Medicare Advantage a better program for older adults:
1) Standardized, regulated benefits - plans should compete on quality of administration, not on gimmicky benefits with low utilization rates.
2) Longer enrollment periods - annual enrollment disables a true focus on investing in chronic disease prevention and management
3) Reform of STAR rating program - high star ratings translate into higher payments to plans and higher benefits. Plans have built in disincentives to serve more complex patients and populations because higher star ratings are harder to achieve with more complex populations. 4) New methods for risk adjustment that are aligned with 2023 technologies - CMS should test machine learning models of risk adjustment that iteratively reward plans for true risk rather than expected risk. 5) More clearly articulated clinical requirements - CMS should articulate stronger clincial guidelines around accesss to care to ensure that no corners are caught in the care of patients.
Critics of Medicare Advantare would have us throw the baby out with bath water. It's a complicated program with good actors and bad actors""and unintended consequences. Like every single other health policy. That said, it provides an incredible amount of security to older adults who are on a fixed income""hence its popularity. Traditional Medicare pushes a sizable cost share on to older adults (whose average pretax income is $48,000) who are often unable to bear the expense of copays (20% of most office visits and $1600 for any hospitalization). Traditional Medicare requires literal acts of Congress (Congress!) to introduce new benefits. There was no prescription drug coverage until 2004 (2004!). There is still no vision, dental, or hearing coverage in traditional Medicare. ACOs may lower total costs of care but they do little to lower costs for beneficiary-save reducing their utilization of services some. President Truman and President Johnson wanted a Medicare program that gave older adults financial security and health coverage in their Golden years. Let's keep working to build a better Medicare program and give them that.",Health insurance
"One of my most important mentors and bosses was Rick Gilfillan.
I worked with Rick in the earliest days of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMMI when he was the first director of CMMI.
He taught me so much. And there are few people in healthcare that I respect more.
However, on the subject of Medicare Advantage (MA)""he has it wrong.
Rick believes the program is beyond repair and believes we should blow it up altogether; my preference is that we acknowledge its flaws and fix them.
We had a spirited debate (moderated by Erin Trish""thank you!) on main stage at #HLTH2023 and Paige Minemyer of Fierce Healthcare does a great job capturing it in the below article.",Health insurance

Let's make sure we communicate,
With insurers, to mitigate,
Any hurdles, before it's too late.

"As I consider the future of the tax profession, diversity continues to be a top priority. Creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce is mission critical, and leaders "" myself included "" need to prioritize tangible solutions that create more opportunities for diverse talent to enter and succeed in our profession. A more balanced workforce ultimately leads to an improved culture and more profitable business. Today, KPMG US launched its 2023 Impact Report sharing the many strides we've made as a firm and practice in support of our people and planet. The report is one more great example of our commitment to diversity, transparency, culture, sustainable practices and our principles. In Tax specifically, one tangible example of our commitment to diversity is our recently launched Tax Scholarship Program. The program is designed to enable individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to further their studies at a school of their choice and grants up to $40K in funding to eligible students, giving them access to the vast KPMG Tax network, including mentors, coaches, internship opportunities and more.
Below are just a few more examples of ways KPMG is working to expand our diversity, as outlined in the report: - Rehires have increased year over year, especially for those from underrepresented backgrounds - 49% of new hires identify as part of an underrepresented racial/ethnic group - Over two-thirds of our FY23 promotion class are from underrepresented backgrounds. To learn more about how a continued investment in our people has been fundamental to our success as a firm, I hope you'll read through this latest Impact Report. While there's always more work to do, we have much to be proud of and I'm looking forward to continuing our important work #Together.

"HealthHelp's NPS of 57 with ordering physicians and their staff can also serve as a predictor of a member's overall satisfaction with their insurer.
Throughout the specialty benefits management process, the safety and well-being of the patient is always consideration number one. HealthHelp also recognizes that the member's overall satisfaction with their experience, and ultimately with their health insurer, is influenced heavily by the interaction between their physician and the payer.
This is where prior authorization can muddy the relationship. A traditional, denial based Utilization Management model can be challenging for a physician to navigate. The potentially negative experience of obtaining a prior authorization can trickle down to the conversation between the patient and their physician's office. Its during the course of this conversation that the ordering physician's frustration is transferred to the member.

We had a wide-ranging conversation on SCAN and the future of the healthcare industry.
Some snippets from our dialog:
""One of the biggest problems we have in healthcare is that most healthcare entrepreneurs don't need healthcare and don't realize how dystopic some of the things that they're creating are"" until they actually need them on the other side of things.""
""I think we have an authenticity problem in healthcare. Everyone starts out with the greatest intent to drive the most change, and then before long, the pressures start to circulate around you and you're just trying to survive, and then you build something that's just as mediocre as the things that you're trying to replace.""
""We've normalized the abnormal in the Medicare Advantage industry, and we've normalized the abnormal in health care more broadly. The opportunity for us is to try to simplify things on behalf of seniors.""
