"One of the things that most excites me about AI is the profound impact it could have on people's health - whether it's improving access; reducing diagnosis times or helping us beat diseases altogether.
To mark the recent Africa HealthTech Summit in Kigali, Rwanda - an event that brings together digital health innovators and public health experts to transform the healthcare landscape in Africa - my colleagues Yossi & Shravya have pulled together five ways we're working with organisations and partners across Africa to research and explore new AI-powered healthcare tools. You can read the full list below - but some of my favourites are:
azi  50% of pregnant people in low-resource settings do not receive ultrasound screenings during pregnancy - despite them being so important in identifying potential issues. We're working with Jacaranda Health, a Kenyan nonprofit, to change that: looking at how AI can enable providers to accurately administer and interpret an ultrasound - moving the needle on maternal and newborn mortality rates. (The video on this, in the blog below, is well worth a watch).
azi  Tuberculosis is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, with over 25% of TB deaths occurring in Africa. TB is treatable, but requires cost-effective screening solutions to catch it early and before it spreads to an entire community. This year, Google partnered with a newly formed consortium of African-based entities to introduce AI-powered screenings across Sub-Saharan Africa. Working with clinical and research partner Right to Care, we're dedicated to providing 100,000 free AI-powered TB screenings.
azi  To support innovators around the world, Google.org earlier announced the funding recipients of our ""AI for the Global Goals"" - $25 million in support to organisations around the world using AI to accelerate progress towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Of the 15 organisations, a third are using AI to improve health outcomes. Read more about them below!

"Musculoskeletal pain effects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. Back pain alone is the leading cause of disability for individuals under 45 years old with 80% of all adults reporting some degree of pain in their lifetime.
With such a significant portion of the population affected by Musculoskeletal pain, treatment can be very complex and determining the best care pathway can pose challenges for physicians. These challenges can prevent patients from receiving optimal care and drive up healthcare costs.
HealthHelp's approach to managing musculoskeletal procedures is built around a multidisciplinary and episode based approach. This approach reduces unnecessary care by educating physicians on appropriate care pathways and the causes of inappropriate treatments. The education and peer collaboration provided through the HealthHelp model is essential to ensure optimal outcomes for patients.

"The #jobs report from last week painted a picture of both growth and slowing in the labor market. Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates.

"For as long as I've worked in the industry, there's been a belief that consumerism would fix all that ails American healthcare.
Consumerism's strong proponents believe that patients""operating more like shoppers for other goods and services""will unleash the power of competition to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
There are a number of reasons that consumerism has failed that go largely undiscussed:
The Market For Clinical Care Is Inelastic
In other markets for goods and services, new entrants join the market when there's an opportunity. In the United States, the supply of clinicians is largely inelastic because of our system of regulating healthcare professionals. The number of medical school, residency, and fellowship positions is largely fixed and not particularly dynamic. It takes, for example, 10 years to produce a new gastroenterologist (4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship). If we really wanted to test the idea that competition could improve outcomes and lower costs""we might open our borders to physicians from other countries and not require them to retrain in the US system (as the state of Tennesse is now doing) or expand allowable scope of practice between disciplines of medicine.
Consolidation & Poor Anti-Trust Enforcement
All segments of healthcare have undergone massive consolidation in the last 20 years. Communities that previously had choices of 5-6 hospitals now have 1 large health system in its place. Physicians who previously practiced independently are now parts of big health systems. These systems exist to elevate selling power with payers and keep prices high. Health plans, for their part, have done the same thing and consolidated as well""and patients in some markets have many fewer choices than they once had of plans, hospitals, and medical groups. A functioning market requires lots of players in order for prices to move elastically.
There Are Massive Information Assymetries
In order to have a functioning market for healthcare goods and services, patients need information about the quality of services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, such information is mixed in quality. Why? Quality measures capture only a small fraction of the clinical scenarios that are relevant to patients. There are literally 100,000s of different clincial scenarios and it is near impossible to measure the skill/capability of a clinician or health system at managing all of these clinical scenarios. Averages may/may not be helpful fo patients in understanding whether a clinician or health system is best at managing their particular scenarios. While there have been efforts to introduce greater transparency, these efforts are surface level at best""not for lack of effort, but because it is so complex. And there remains more art than science in many clinical scenarious making defining a ""gold standard"" very difficult.
Do you still believe ""consumerism"" can fix what ails American healthcare?",Supply chain
