"Yesterday, Roche hosted the IR Digitalization Day webinar. Alongside my colleagues, Moritz Hartmann, Aviv Regev, Scott Oloff and Kent Kost, I had the honor of presenting our digitalization strategy across Roche and how we are leveraging technology to shape opportunities in healthcare to revolutionize the patient journey. In particular, I focused on how Roche Informatics is driving integrated data platforms and infrastructure.
As the healthcare industry continues to digitize, Roche is actively leveraging its potential to explore disruptive innovation opportunities to enhance the impact we have on patients' lives. From the power of artificial intelligence and large language models to the overall digitalization along the value chain, we covered many interesting topics that I personally feel very excited about.
Special thanks goes to our Head of Investor Relations Bruno Eschli and his team for this great event!

Today, many cancers can be prevented, treated and even cured. However 50% of the worldâ€™s population lacks access to essential health services.
At Roche, we are committed to closing the care gap and empowering those who work with us to do the same. Together, we are partnering with the global healthcare community to bring us closer to the goal of advancing cancer care for all patients, everywhere. Additionally, we believe in technology and the power of data as key drivers to advance research, generate insights and thus accelerate our impact to prevent and provide cures for cancer in all its forms.

"Roche published its full-year results for 2022 today - we achieved good results even though the demand for COVID-19 products declined, as expected. The diagnostics base business and our newer medicines continued their strong growth. For the current year we expect solid underlying growth in both divisions, which will largely compensate for the further drop in sales of roughly CHF 5 billion in COVID-19 products.
I invite you to take a journey through our business year in 2022 and uncover in our newly released annual report how our teams brought meaningful change to millions of patients around the world by, for example, bringing two new medicines to patients: Vabysmo for certain severe eye diseases and Lunsumio for a currently incurable form of blood cancer.

Under this agreement, by January 2024, our oral treatment will be offered through commercial channels, not just the emergency federal channels created and used by the US government during the pandemic. As a result, more pharmacies, clinics and other healthcare sites are expected to be able to stock this treatment, making it more accessible for eligible patients across the US.
In addition, on behalf of the federal government, Pfizer will set up a patient assistance program for the uninsured and underinsured through 2028. Patients insured through federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive treatment free of charge in 2024.

"We're committed to closing the health equity gap around the world. Thatâ€™s why, today, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Pfizer announced a substantial expansion in our commitment to An Accord for a Healthier World to offer the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines for which we have global rights to enable greater access for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries. This greatly expands our initial commitment to offer all of our patented medicines and vaccines available in the U.S. or EU to include off-patent medicines, as well. It brings our portfolio offering on a not-for-profit basis to the 45 lower-income Accord countries from 23 to around 500 products. In just the first seven months since the launch of the Accord, weâ€™ve made important progress. Weâ€™ve delivered our first shipments of Pfizer medicines and vaccines to Rwanda, supported healthcare trainings and deployed a Global Health Team to help identify opportunities for long-term supply chain optimization. Weâ€™re now in advanced discussions with 16 other countries around access and health systems support. Itâ€™s this type of cooperation that is so critical to creating sustainable access and resilient health ecosystems that will bring long-term health and prosperity to many.

To kick things off, my colleague Mikael Dolsten and I recently sat down with Beth Battaglino, President and CEO of HealthyWomen.org, and more than 240 global patient advocates for a fireside chat. We covered several topics, but two that were particularly important to me are captured below:
- We measure our success at Pfizer not only through financial metrics, but also by how many patients we have impacted each month, each quarter, and each year. We report on our patient impact every quarter to remind ourselves of the important work we do.
- There is a significant health equity gap in our world, and we view it as our responsibility to help close that gap.

- As of March 12, 2023, we have delivered more than 4.5 billion doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to 181 countries and territories in every region of the world. This includes nearly 1.8 billion doses to low- and middle-income countries.

- Through An Accord for a Healthier World, we're offering the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines that we have global rights to on a not-for-profit basis to 45 lower-income countries, while also collaborating with governments and global health leaders to address gaps in diagnosis, education, infrastructure, storage and more to enhance access to our products for those who need them.

"Atrial fibrillation is heart failureâ€™s dangerous partner. Afibâ€™s rapid and irregular heart rhythm affects more than 37 million people around the world, increasing their risk of stroke, heart failure, and other coronary diseases. At the annual Heart Rhythm Society conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, I met with electrophysiologists and researchers to learn more about how we are innovating to address this unmet healthcare need. Johnson & Johnson is at the forefront of cardiac ablation, which uses a catheter to deliver high-energy pulses inside the heart to correct malfunctioning pathways that cause it to beat out of rhythm. This is particularly helpful for patients who canâ€™t tolerate pharmaceutical treatments, but it isnâ€™t without risk, which is why we are always looking to improve standards of care. As I did, physicians who visited our booth experimented with our latest ablation catheters that deliver higher-powered pulses lasting up to four seconds, compared to pulses of 20 seconds or longer.
The shorter procedures could improve patient outcomes and increase patient access by allowing doctors to perform more procedures per day.
Together, our dedicated teams of innovators in MedTech are determined to develop tools that will profoundly impact the lives of millions of people living with Afib.",Health outcomes

"One of the things that most excites me about AI is the profound impact it could have on peopleâ€™s health - whether itâ€™s improving access; reducing diagnosis times or helping us beat diseases altogether.
To mark the recent Africa HealthTech Summit in Kigali, Rwanda - an event that brings together digital health innovators and public health experts to transform the healthcare landscape in Africa - my colleagues Yossi & Shravya have pulled together five ways weâ€™re working with organisations and partners across Africa to research and explore new AI-powered healthcare tools. You can read the full list below - but some of my favourites are:
âž¡ï¸ 50% of pregnant people in low-resource settings do not receive ultrasound screenings during pregnancy - despite them being so important in identifying potential issues. Weâ€™re working with Jacaranda Health, a Kenyan nonprofit, to change that: looking at how AI can enable providers to accurately administer and interpret an ultrasound - moving the needle on maternal and newborn mortality rates. (The video on this, in the blog below, is well worth a watch).
âž¡ï¸ Tuberculosis is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, with over 25% of TB deaths occurring in Africa. TB is treatable, but requires cost-effective screening solutions to catch it early and before it spreads to an entire community. This year, Google partnered with a newly formed consortium of African-based entities to introduce AI-powered screenings across Sub-Saharan Africa. Working with clinical and research partner Right to Care, weâ€™re dedicated to providing 100,000 free AI-powered TB screenings.
âž¡ï¸ To support innovators around the world, Google.org earlier announced the funding recipients of our â€œAI for the Global Goalsâ€ - $25 million in support to organisations around the world using AI to accelerate progress towards the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals. Of the 15 organisations, a third are using AI to improve health outcomes. Read more about them below!

"Last week we hosted our third annual #TheCheckUp event. Teams across Google had the opportunity to share their incredible work, and show how it is helping us achieve our goal to help billions of people be healthier. For those who have followed the work at @Google Health, you know that we serve three core groups: consumers, caregivers, and communities. During The Check Up (health.google.com), we shared ways we are expanding access to quality health information, supporting people on their health journey, and helping enterprises meet consumers where they are as they seek a mobile first, more personalized experience. On Search, we will soon make Medicaid re-enrollment information easier to find, and help people understand and take the right actions for their state.

"IHI has partnered with the Johnson & Johnson Center for Health Worker Innovation to conduct a 22-month project to transform healthcare through innovative nurse-led care delivery solutions.
Phase 1 of the work is complete. This year, IHI identified promising and evidence-based care delivery approaches that attract, support, and strengthen a thriving and diverse #nursing workforce. We did this through literature review, expert interviews, and formation of a testable theory of change and measures under guidance of an expert panel.
Phase 2 is next. Weâ€™ll be working with up to five health care systems in a Learning and Action Prototyping Network to test and refine our theory of change. Under the guidance of subject matter and improvement science experts, participating organizations will test and implement solutions that lead to local improvements for patients and colleagues, and have the potential to transform nursing and nursing care on a larger scale. There is no fee to participate in the project. Interested hospital systems can apply by Friday, July 14. Or for more information, join us for an informational call on Monday, July 10 at 2PM EST. Start here for the project prospectus and info call signup: https://lnkd.in/eR4KBeWN.

"Excited to see CMSâ€™ GUIDE Model to improve quality of life for people living with #dementia and those who care for them: https://lnkd.in/etDhUVnu.
This model is an important contribution to healthcareâ€™s #AgeFriendly movement. It offers a standard approach to dementia care, including 24/7 access to a support line as well as caregiver training, education, and support services. Knowing that dementia imposes significant financial, emotional, and logistical burdens on families that are often exacerbated for certain racial and ethnic groups, the GUIDE model was designed to reduce disparities in access to dementia services, and it incorporates policies to advance #HealthEquity.
This Fall, CMMI will issue an RFA to help test the GUIDE model and alternative payment for organizations that deliver supportive services to people with dementia. Organizations that provide care to underserved communities are encouraged to apply. A variety of financial and technical supports will be available to ensure that participating safety-net providers can develop their infrastructure, improve their care delivery capabilities, and participate successfully in the model. Until the RFA is issued, interested folks can submit to CMS a Letter of Intent by September 15. Iâ€™m looking forward to following the impact of this work!

"I worry that approaches like this (billing for some electronic health communications) de-incentivize clinician-patient interaction, especially when the cost is put on the #patient instead of being borne by our payers.
But more than that, I worry that weâ€™re getting caught up in the weeds while the biggest question remains...
When are we going to say enough already with this ridiculous transactional system of #FeeForService medicine?
The medical emails that this article talks about account for 1-1.5% of all clinician-patient â€œemailâ€ threads. The revenue generated is a drop in the bucket. And alleviated 1% of our inboxes as docs isnâ€™t going to solve the burnout or turnover problems we face.
But, what happens when patients with complex needs stop messaging their clinicians because theyâ€™re afraid of incurring a bill?
They donâ€™t get the information they need to manage their care, their condition worsens, and they wind up in the #ER â€“ the most expensive setting in a health system. No one wins.
But, a #HealthSystem that's built on relationships and is managing costs on a capitated basis can promote engagement and dialogue with patients. Because studies have shown time and again that consistent, effective patient-clinician communication is associated with better health outcomes and often lower costs.
A health system in a value-based environment is incentivized to staff an inbox or implement a virtual hotline, because they know that consistent communication is linked to better outcomes and that's the basis on which the institution is paid/rewarded. Frankly such a system just allows doctors and nurses to spend the time needed with their patients to build relationships and mitigate high cost health risks.
On the other hand, poor communication and lack of interaction between patients and clinicians are known contributors to #disparities and deepen distrust in health care. And thatâ€™s exactly what weâ€™re going to do with these absurd charges for emails. Weâ€™re going to make it harder for patients to communicate with their clinicians and itâ€™s going to lead to less access and less needed care. We cannot allow this to happen. Trust is an essential element in advancing #HealthEquity.
So, let's put an end to the madness.
Let's make value-based payment infrastructure ubiquitous.
Let's incentivize communication and evidence-based approaches that improve #PatientExperience, improve #PopulationHealth, and reduce the per capita cost of health care. We know the way. We just need the will. Who's with me? #QI",Health outcomes
"Why do businesses play a key role in advancing #HealthEquity? Because employers own some of the major drivers of health #disparitiesâ€”determinants such as income, economic stability, benefits (PTO, health insurance, mental health supports), and social conditions in the communities in which they operate. With this power comes a responsibility to act.
Business leaders looking for a place to start should consider this excellent piece from Harvard Business Review: https://bit.ly/3CHNvCp.
Authors Shantanu Nundy Lisa Cooper, and Ellen Kelsay outline several opportunities that companies can pursue to improve health equity among their employees and communities. Take note and take action!

"I shared my thoughts on the state of the healthcare industry with David Raths.
On the Medicare Advantage v. FFS Medicare
The truth is that we've failed on some level. The way I know that we've failed is that we've been engaged in the zero-sum debates about whether Medicare Advantage is better or fee-for-service Medicare is better. I would say if our industry had done its job, we would have settled those debates a decade ago. When we used to talk about the move to value, we talked about your feet being in multiple canoes moving in different directions. Now we've got 10 boats and we've got for only two feet and two arms, and we're trying to be in all boats. And some organizations are finding themselves falling into the water as a result, because there are so many different payment programs that have slightly different rules, incentives and models. We talk a lot about harmonizing benefits, but it doesn't really work that way.
On Biopharma Innovation and the Limitations of Annual Enrollment
I used to work at Merck, and I think about all my former biotech colleagues and pharma colleagues, who are inventing truly amazing things, but they're expensive. The total lifetime cost for someone with severe sickle cell disease is in the millions of dollars because of all the pain crises and the hospital admissions that these folks experience. If you know a patient with bad sickle cell disease is bouncing to and from the hospital and emergency room, and you have a cure that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to administer, you want to be able to pay for that and know that there's going to be some return on it. But unfortunately, I can cure you tomorrow, pay for your cure, and then next year, you can switch insurance or jobs and switch insurance. So there's a natural resistance within the system to funding things that have longer payback periods.
On Inauthenticity
â€œOne observation is that I think we have normalized inauthenticity. We talk about changing lives and we talk about improving lives and commitment to community and being better and supporting people and then you look at some of our industry's actions: we're putting people in a medical debt we talk about the benefits for social determinants of health, but then we put real barriers in front of people to actually access those benefits.
I think we've normalized inauthenticity. We make ourselves feel better to some extent by talking about all the small things that we do to make a small number of people's lives better, but the reality is that we've participated in complexifying the U.S. healthcare system to the point where we've eroded trust with people and communities, and I think it's time to turn it around.â€",Health outcomes

When we launched our ISNP two years ago, our teams (led initially by Payam Parvinchiha, MD, MPH, Lisa Hildreth, Benjamin Ware, MD, Alyssa Rios and other great leadersâ€”and now also by Gabe Waterman, MD, MBA, Daniel Croymans, MD, MBA, Sheerali Patel PharmD, BCPS) set out to build something special and different that provided direct care to members with the highest clinical care.
We are deliberately hard on ourselves and need to be even harder on the path to clinical excellence. We have grown quickly and occasionally stumbled. We continue to feel instinctively that we can be even better.
But this random interaction affirmed that we are on path to build and scale a clinical model of care to which every home and institution-bound older adult should have access.
The fact that even one person was making a life decision as profound as moving based on the presence of our health plan and our clinical teamsâ€”was as gratifying a feeling as I have had in a long time.
It was also a reminder that critics of Medicare Advantage often donâ€™t see some of the unique innovations that are enabled by prepayment.
Every Embrace patient has access to:
1) an employed nurse practitioner and primary care doctor who visits them on the home on a regular basis (sometimes weekly or daily if necessary)
2) a case manager and/or social worker who facilitates transitions of care and ensures that frail and demented patients donâ€™t spend more time than they need to in hospitals
3) a pharmacist who works consistently to identify opportunities to optimize their medication regimens
4) on-site, in-home diagnostics and specialist consultations to help avoid confusing, unnecessary visits to medical care settings.
Itâ€™s hard to understand the difference programs like this make until you see them in action.
Or until your neighborâ€™s sister says she isnâ€™t going to move to a geography where your plan doesnâ€™t exist.",Health outcomes
"I sat down with Lauren Berryman of Modern Healthcare for a wide-ranging conversation on the current state of healthcare.

-Medicare Advantage products for specialized populations
-SCANâ€™s proposed combination with CareOregon
-SCAN efforts to reduce the burden of medical debt

"To achieve true â€œvalue-based care,â€ healthcare organizations need to be able to think about and invest in patient health for longer periods than in 1-year cycles.
There is nothing magical about 365 days. It takes far longer to achieve meaningful (and lasting) improvements in health.
What if health insurance products like Medicare Advantage were sold with 3-year enrollment cycles?
Measurement systems like STAR ratings could be based on true health improvements over 3-year cycles rather than check-box measures presently included in most quality rating systems.
Plans and medical groups could invest in building true and deep relationships with patients rather than gimmicky relationships based on short-term benefit offers.
Our number one obstacle to true value-based care is the annual enrollment cycle.",Health outcomes
"Radiation Therapy: Navigating Optimal Breast Cancer Care
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, highlights the findings from a recent study shared at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2023 Conference.
â€œIn terms of selecting the best course of radiation treatment post mastectomy, the results of the first-of-its-kind, FABREC study were just presented at ASTRO. This was a randomized comparison across multiple institutions of standard fractionation (25) versus shorter course (16) in the post mastectomy setting. With an average follow up for five years, the results reflected equivalence. This will allow patients to complete their course of therapy in a shorter amount of time, as well as having fewer side effects. Skin toxicity in late term fibrosis are also substantially better with shorter fractionation as demonstrated in the study.""

"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
â€œFor early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
â€œAdditionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.â€

"Radiation Therapy: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, reducing the number of fractions a patient receives can minimize toxicity to the patient while offering the same efficacy. However, it is still common for providers to order a course of fractionation outside of published, evidence-based guidelines.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his insight on the benefits of reduced fractionation for patients being treated for bone metastasis.
â€œASTRO guidelines recommend one to five fractions for management of bone mets. Providers routinely treat with 10 fractions or more in many clinical circumstances resulting in increased toxicity to the patient such as erythema and reduction of bone marrow burden. Conversion of treatment of bone metastasis from 10 fractions to five or one fraction is reflective of the ASTRO guidelines and helps minimize the potential negative side effects for the patient.""

"Demographic shifts lead to an uptick in imaging utilization.
A study in the American Journal of Roentgenology titled ""Spending on Medical Imaging by Age and Gender in the U.S. Population With Employer-Sponsored Insurance"" observed that imaging utilization increased with age until approximately age 80-85.
As recorded in the study and based on US Census data, the largest population growth is ""projected among individuals 40 to 50 years old and 65 years old and up"" pointing to the eventuality of increased imaging use amongst this cohort.
As utilization grows, payers should review their imaging guidelines and consider managed programs that provide ordering physicians with the latest evidence-based medical criteria through consultations with sub-specialists at leading academic departments to ensure that the appropriate testing is performed, resulting in the best possible outcome for the member.

"Prostate Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
Prostate cancer treatment remains a topic of debate amongst oncologists. The use of radiation therapy, in particular, can be a subject of controversy.
Very often, radiation therapy is recommended when ""watchful waiting"" may be a viable, if not preferred, option.
â€œPatients with low-risk prostate cancer should always be offered the choice of omission and watchful waiting. This approach is more common globally but less so in the United States,"" states Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a board-certified Radiation Oncologist, who currently serves as a Faculty Physician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
â€œWhy is this important? It's not just about reducing unnecessary harm and toxicity from radiation. It's also about cost savings from avoiding unnecessary treatments.â€
