"Generative AI represents an inflection point in cybersecurity. It presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Thereâ€™s a new opportunity to elevate and advance the skillset of your analysts but the challenge is your adversaries are using GenAI, too.
My perspective is that security is a data problem. This is even more clear now that generative AI is on the scene. Companies that approach modern security challenges through a search lens have the advantage. If youâ€™re interested in learning more about this approach, check out the latest report from IDC on the Elastic AI Assistant:",Data privacy and cybersecurity
"Today we reported Elasticâ€™s Q2 earnings results. Our outlook remains strong, and Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities ahead. Iâ€™d like to highlight three key trends weâ€™re seeing in our business:
- Generative AI continues to drive a resurgence of excitement around enterprise search. Our Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE) provides the most comprehensive and enterprise-ready platform for use cases across semantic search, vector search, and hybrid search.
- Customers are looking to consolidate onto the Elastic platform for multiple use cases as they seek ways to lower their total spend without sacrificing innovation. More customers are choosing us over incumbent solutions for observability and security, helping them save on their overall IT spend while gaining even greater value through our many innovations.
- Continued improvements helped drive cloud revenue growth. Customers are continuing to stay focused on costs, but they've generally optimized their Elastic deployments and are now focused on driving new workloads to Elastic. This is an area where we continue to help our customers get the most out of Elastic. Our customer-centric approach drives improved customer satisfaction and engagement, and increased consumption over time.
Enabling everyone to find the answers that matter. From all data, in real time, at scale. That is our mission. At a time when companies are looking for ways to reduce costs and gain efficiencies without sacrificing innovation, especially around Generative AI, Elasticâ€™s search analytics platform is becoming the natural choice for businesses.",Cost management / reduction / optimization

"On June 19, we commemorate the end of slavery in the United States with Juneteenth.
Did you know? On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln enacted the Emancipation Proclamation, officially declaring the end of slavery. However, thousands of people living in slavery werenâ€™t made aware of their freedom until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston on June 19, 1865 meaning that for over two and a half years, many remained in slavery despite being freed. Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates freedom.

"The world needs Africa to thrive. Home to the youngest and fastest-growing population on Earth, the continent will play a critical role in our ability to make the transition to net zero and lessen the emerging impact of demographic decline.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have just published a new report on Africa. They describe it as a â€œclarion call for sustainable, inclusive growth.â€ It takes a granular look at Africaâ€™s economic performance, highlighting successes across its countries, cities, and companies.
You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/gmBdRT7K
The report finds that Africaâ€™s growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But thereâ€™s no â€˜one Africa.â€™ Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from whatâ€™s working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sectorâ€”even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010â€”it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets wonâ€™t be easy, especially amid todayâ€™s headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continentâ€”and the global economyâ€”thrive.

"With hashtag#COP28 underway, I wanted to share some insights from a conversation I recently had with Christiana Figueres for my latest podcast episode. Christiana is the former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change. In this episode, she talks about how embracing an optimistic mindset helped her lead the process that secured the Paris Agreement, and how she now applies this way of thinking to our current challenge: that we need to execute climate solutions much faster and at greater scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. â€œOptimism,â€ she said, â€œis not the output. Itâ€™s the input. Itâ€™s the mindset. It is the focus of our attention and our conviction that we actually have everything that it takes to solve a problem.â€
One reality is that we are behind. The other reality is that, with technology, we are â€œway forward, way faster, than we ever thought possible.â€ I agree with Christiana that now is the moment to set these two realities side by side â€“ â€œto see them in equal importanceâ€ â€“ and get to work. Yes, we are behind. But we can still catch up and build a sustainable net-zero future. And Iâ€™m proud that, at COP 28, Siemens is in the Green Zone showcasing technology to make this possible.
After all, as Christiana said, if energy is driving 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy can also be 75 percent of the solution. hashtag#OptimisticOutlook",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"I asked a generative AI program to write a LinkedIn post about a current tech policy trend. As you can see, AI won't be ascending to the throne of thought leader anytime soon; the post is primarily a fluffed regurgitation of facts. Not bad for some surface-level online engagement, but does it have any unique, thought-provoking perspective? Is it *saying* anything, or is it just *reciting*?
In its current state, generative AI should be considered a tool, not a one-stop shop. These tools could be useful for trend analysis or background research, which can then be incorporated into an individual's own thought leadership. But as companies start rolling out new uses for AI in their business, remember the one thing we all have that this tech doesnâ€™t: our own unique voice.
There are estimates saying generative AI could become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, so this is definitely an area to keep a very close eye on.

"KPMG just released our latest edition of #CEOoutlook, and it was great to speak to Forbes about this year's findings. I encourage you to take a look as I was struck by how the stats tell one of the clearest stories yet.
Weâ€™ve been running this research for 9 years, where we speak to thousands of leaders across a vast array of territories and industry groups. Results typically vary from one region to the next, but this year, there was greater consistency across regions and sectors.
From a shifting geopolitical landscape to AI and ESG â€“ executives are juggling with a raft of new opportunities and threats â€“ on top of the day-to-day challenge of balancing the books during a period of economic unease. But despite it all, confidence in the wider economy is broadly positive â€“ echoing my own view that better market conditions are on the horizon even as we face numerous obstacles.
The key to success will be a relentless focus on long-term, strategic planning that avoids the danger of reactive decisions limited by a narrow short-term horizon. Thatâ€™s certainly been the case at KPMG as weâ€™ve regularly had to update our strategy and reaffirm our commitment to it.
2020, 2021, 2022, 2023â€¦ Each year unpredictable, each year creating a new norm. Itâ€™s impossible to believe that any five-year plan has been left untouched. Yet businesses are moving forward, learning new ways to build resilience, and focusing on the bigger picture.
Iâ€™ll leave you with my favorite statistic in this report: 69% of CEOs have now fully embedded ESG into their businesses as a means to value creation. Itâ€™s a very encouraging finding and if the KPMG 2023 CEO Outlook tells us anything, itâ€™s that leaders are prepared and ready to do what it takes to build a more sustainable world that benefits every one of us.",Economic Outlook

#Juneteenth celebrates people of African ancestryâ€™s independence from slavery, a proclamation given over 150 years ago. The order was delivered some two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Since January 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a State holiday, more than 40 other states passed legislation following. This culminated in the signing into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day. Historians have observed that Juneteenth is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States. It is important to recognize and acknowledge Juneteenth and remember it was the beginning of a long journey towards racial equality in North America.
Throughout the year, lets celebrate the heritage of African American/Canadian people in our country and in our communities, reflect on the many contributions they have made since the 1600s and hear their hope of participating equally in a just society.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential, and are revolutionising the way we innovate and transform the healthcare industry in particular. As the CIO/CFO at Roche, I am thrilled to witness the paradigm shift these technologies are bringing to our work.
AI has evolved tremendously, and the advent of LLMs opened up a number of new possibilities. At Roche, we are leveraging the power of AI and LLMs to fuel our research and development efforts. The ability to gain productivity, support data collection, fuel knowledge management, and accelerate drug discovery is transforming the landscape of healthcare. We are empowered to explore new hypotheses, access cutting-edge information, and make informed decisions faster and more efficient than ever before.
As part of the Informatics Strategy, and to ensure that we are the drivers of cutting-edge technology at Roche, we have taken a first step toward defining our global AI strategy. We see a huge potential in seizing this opportunity to push the boundaries of innovation, unlock new horizons, and create a better future for all. However, with great power comes great responsibility and whilst acting as entrepreneurial spearheads we need to master the art of smart risk-taking. I canâ€™t wait to see where Roche will lead this transformative journey to better serve our patients.
How is AI and LLMs revolutionising your industry?

"Yesterday we had an inspiring and informative session at the Roche Global Finance Dialogue. We focused on the crucial topic of working towards a hybrid finance function, one of our five theses around the #FutureOfFinance. The purpose of this Dialogue was to connect as a team, learn about recent business developments, and strengthen our collective commitment to leveraging digital capabilities in Finance. A special thanks goes to Svenja Amrhein for the great moderation as well as outstanding Finance colleagues like David Dubovsky and his team that are championing this topic.
We discussed how Digital in Finance is no longer just a nice-to-have, but an essential prerequisite for us to achieve our ambitious goals. To meet our contributions effectively, both individually and as a team, it is imperative that we actively engage in this transformative journey and dedicate efforts to upskill in Digital Finance.
To support our Finance community in this exciting endeavour and foster individual and collective accountability, we are proud to introduce the newly formed Digital Finance Hub. This hub will serve as a valuable resource, providing clarity and a harmonised strategy to empower us in our digital transformation journey.
On top, this session served as a preparation for the upcoming Connecting Finance Day later this month. During this event, our global Finance community will have a fantastic opportunity to directly connect with colleagues who are actively involved in Digital Finance and adjacent topics. It will be a platform to exchange ideas, share experiences, and deepen our understanding of the various aspects of Digital Finance.
Let's embrace this new era of digital transformation and seize the opportunity to shape the #FutureOfFinance together. By taking individual accountability for our own learning, we can drive innovation, enhance our capabilities, and contribute to make an impact for Roche and patients. I know that we in Finance are ready to achieve our ambitious goals!

"For as long as Iâ€™ve worked in the industry, thereâ€™s been a belief that consumerism would fix all that ails American healthcare.
Consumerismâ€™s strong proponents believe that patientsâ€”operating more like shoppers for other goods and servicesâ€”will unleash the power of competition to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
There are a number of reasons that consumerism has failed that go largely undiscussed:
The Market For Clinical Care Is Inelastic
In other markets for goods and services, new entrants join the market when thereâ€™s an opportunity. In the United States, the supply of clinicians is largely inelastic because of our system of regulating healthcare professionals. The number of medical school, residency, and fellowship positions is largely fixed and not particularly dynamic. It takes, for example, 10 years to produce a new gastroenterologist (4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship). If we really wanted to test the idea that competition could improve outcomes and lower costsâ€”we might open our borders to physicians from other countries and not require them to retrain in the US system (as the state of Tennesse is now doing) or expand allowable scope of practice between disciplines of medicine.
Consolidation & Poor Anti-Trust Enforcement
All segments of healthcare have undergone massive consolidation in the last 20 years. Communities that previously had choices of 5-6 hospitals now have 1 large health system in its place. Physicians who previously practiced independently are now parts of big health systems. These systems exist to elevate selling power with payers and keep prices high. Health plans, for their part, have done the same thing and consolidated as wellâ€”and patients in some markets have many fewer choices than they once had of plans, hospitals, and medical groups. A functioning market requires lots of players in order for prices to move elastically.
There Are Massive Information Assymetries
In order to have a functioning market for healthcare goods and services, patients need information about the quality of services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, such information is mixed in quality. Why? Quality measures capture only a small fraction of the clinical scenarios that are relevant to patients. There are literally 100,000s of different clincial scenarios and it is near impossible to measure the skill/capability of a clinician or health system at managing all of these clinical scenarios. Averages may/may not be helpful fo patients in understanding whether a clinician or health system is best at managing their particular scenarios. While there have been efforts to introduce greater transparency, these efforts are surface level at bestâ€”not for lack of effort, but because it is so complex. And there remains more art than science in many clinical scenarious making defining a â€œgold standardâ€ very difficult.
Do you still believe â€œconsumerismâ€ can fix what ails American healthcare?",Supply chain
