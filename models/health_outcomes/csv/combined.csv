"Generative AI represents an inflection point in cybersecurity. It presents both an opportunity and a challenge. There's a new opportunity to elevate and advance the skillset of your analysts but the challenge is your adversaries are using GenAI, too.
My perspective is that security is a data problem. This is even more clear now that generative AI is on the scene. Companies that approach modern security challenges through a search lens have the advantage. If you're interested in learning more about this approach, check out the latest report from IDC on the Elastic AI Assistant:",Data privacy and cybersecurity
"Today we reported Elastic's Q2 earnings results. Our outlook remains strong, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I'd like to highlight three key trends we're seeing in our business:
- Generative AI continues to drive a resurgence of excitement around enterprise search. Our Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE) provides the most comprehensive and enterprise-ready platform for use cases across semantic search, vector search, and hybrid search.
- Customers are looking to consolidate onto the Elastic platform for multiple use cases as they seek ways to lower their total spend without sacrificing innovation. More customers are choosing us over incumbent solutions for observability and security, helping them save on their overall IT spend while gaining even greater value through our many innovations.
- Continued improvements helped drive cloud revenue growth. Customers are continuing to stay focused on costs, but they've generally optimized their Elastic deployments and are now focused on driving new workloads to Elastic. This is an area where we continue to help our customers get the most out of Elastic. Our customer-centric approach drives improved customer satisfaction and engagement, and increased consumption over time.
Enabling everyone to find the answers that matter. From all data, in real time, at scale. That is our mission. At a time when companies are looking for ways to reduce costs and gain efficiencies without sacrificing innovation, especially around Generative AI, Elastic's search analytics platform is becoming the natural choice for businesses.",Cost management / reduction / optimization

"On June 19, we commemorate the end of slavery in the United States with Juneteenth.
Did you know? On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln enacted the Emancipation Proclamation, officially declaring the end of slavery. However, thousands of people living in slavery weren't made aware of their freedom until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston on June 19, 1865 meaning that for over two and a half years, many remained in slavery despite being freed.

"The world needs Africa to thrive. Home to the youngest and fastest-growing population on Earth, the continent will play a critical role in our ability to make the transition to net zero and lessen the emerging impact of demographic decline.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have just published a new report on Africa. They describe it as a ""clarion call for sustainable, inclusive growth."" It takes a granular look at Africa's economic performance, highlighting successes across its countries, cities, and companies.
You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/gmBdRT7K
The report finds that Africa's growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But there's no "" one Africa.' Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from what's working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sector""even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010""it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets won't be easy, especially amid today's headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continent""and the global economy""thrive.

"With hashtag#COP28 underway, I wanted to share some insights from a conversation I recently had with Christiana Figueres for my latest podcast episode. Christiana is the former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change. In this episode, she talks about how embracing an optimistic mindset helped her lead the process that secured the Paris Agreement, and how she now applies this way of thinking to our current challenge: that we need to execute climate solutions much faster and at greater scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. ""Optimism,"" she said, ""is not the output. It's the input. It's the mindset. It is the focus of our attention and our conviction that we actually have everything that it takes to solve a problem.""
One reality is that we are behind. The other reality is that, with technology, we are ""way forward, way faster, than we ever thought possible."" I agree with Christiana that now is the moment to set these two realities side by side "" ""to see them in equal importance"" "" and get to work. Yes, we are behind. But we can still catch up and build a sustainable net-zero future. And I'm proud that, at COP 28, Siemens is in the Green Zone showcasing technology to make this possible.
After all, as Christiana said, if energy is driving 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy can also be 75 percent of the solution. hashtag#OptimisticOutlook",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"I asked a generative AI program to write a LinkedIn post about a current tech policy trend. As you can see, AI won't be ascending to the throne of thought leader anytime soon; the post is primarily a fluffed regurgitation of facts. Not bad for some surface-level online engagement, but does it have any unique, thought-provoking perspective? Is it *saying* anything, or is it just *reciting*?
In its current state, generative AI should be considered a tool, not a one-stop shop. These tools could be useful for trend analysis or background research, which can then be incorporated into an individual's own thought leadership. But as companies start rolling out new uses for AI in their business, remember the one thing we all have that this tech doesn't: our own unique voice.
There are estimates saying generative AI could become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, so this is definitely an area to keep a very close eye on.

We've been running this research for 9 years, where we speak to thousands of leaders across a vast array of territories and industry groups. Results typically vary from one region to the next, but this year, there was greater consistency across regions and sectors.

But despite it all, confidence in the wider economy is broadly positive "" echoing my own view that better market conditions are on the horizon even as we face numerous obstacles.

#Juneteenth celebrates people of African ancestry's independence from slavery, a proclamation given over 150 years ago. The order was delivered some two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Since January 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a State holiday, more than 40 other states passed legislation following. This culminated in the signing into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day. Historians have observed that Juneteenth is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States. It is important to recognize and acknowledge Juneteenth and remember it was the beginning of a long journey towards racial equality in North America.
Throughout the year, lets celebrate the heritage of African American/Canadian people in our country and in our communities, reflect on the many contributions they have made since the 1600s and hear their hope of participating equally in a just society.

We are empowered to explore new hypotheses, access cutting-edge information, and make informed decisions faster and more efficient than ever before.
As part of the Informatics Strategy, and to ensure that we are the drivers of cutting-edge technology at Roche, we have taken a first step toward defining our global AI strategy. We see a huge potential in seizing this opportunity to push the boundaries of innovation, unlock new horizons, and create a better future for all. However, with great power comes great responsibility and whilst acting as entrepreneurial spearheads we need to master the art of smart risk-taking. I can't wait to see where Roche will lead this transformative journey to better serve our patients.
How is AI and LLMs revolutionising your industry?

"Yesterday we had an inspiring and informative session at the Roche Global Finance Dialogue. We focused on the crucial topic of working towards a hybrid finance function, one of our five theses around the #FutureOfFinance. The purpose of this Dialogue was to connect as a team, learn about recent business developments, and strengthen our collective commitment to leveraging digital capabilities in Finance. A special thanks goes to Svenja Amrhein for the great moderation as well as outstanding Finance colleagues like David Dubovsky and his team that are championing this topic.
We discussed how Digital in Finance is no longer just a nice-to-have, but an essential prerequisite for us to achieve our ambitious goals. To meet our contributions effectively, both individually and as a team, it is imperative that we actively engage in this transformative journey and dedicate efforts to upskill in Digital Finance.
To support our Finance community in this exciting endeavour and foster individual and collective accountability, we are proud to introduce the newly formed Digital Finance Hub. This hub will serve as a valuable resource, providing clarity and a harmonised strategy to empower us in our digital transformation journey.
On top, this session served as a preparation for the upcoming Connecting Finance Day later this month. During this event, our global Finance community will have a fantastic opportunity to directly connect with colleagues who are actively involved in Digital Finance and adjacent topics. It will be a platform to exchange ideas, share experiences, and deepen our understanding of the various aspects of Digital Finance.
Let's embrace this new era of digital transformation and seize the opportunity to shape the #FutureOfFinance together. By taking individual accountability for our own learning, we can drive innovation, enhance our capabilities, and contribute to make an impact for Roche and patients. I know that we in Finance are ready to achieve our ambitious goals!

"For as long as I've worked in the industry, there's been a belief that consumerism would fix all that ails American healthcare.
Consumerism's strong proponents believe that patients""operating more like shoppers for other goods and services""will unleash the power of competition to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
There are a number of reasons that consumerism has failed that go largely undiscussed:
The Market For Clinical Care Is Inelastic
In other markets for goods and services, new entrants join the market when there's an opportunity. In the United States, the supply of clinicians is largely inelastic because of our system of regulating healthcare professionals. The number of medical school, residency, and fellowship positions is largely fixed and not particularly dynamic. It takes, for example, 10 years to produce a new gastroenterologist (4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship). If we really wanted to test the idea that competition could improve outcomes and lower costs""we might open our borders to physicians from other countries and not require them to retrain in the US system (as the state of Tennesse is now doing) or expand allowable scope of practice between disciplines of medicine.
Consolidation & Poor Anti-Trust Enforcement
All segments of healthcare have undergone massive consolidation in the last 20 years. Communities that previously had choices of 5-6 hospitals now have 1 large health system in its place. Physicians who previously practiced independently are now parts of big health systems. These systems exist to elevate selling power with payers and keep prices high. Health plans, for their part, have done the same thing and consolidated as well""and patients in some markets have many fewer choices than they once had of plans, hospitals, and medical groups. A functioning market requires lots of players in order for prices to move elastically.
There Are Massive Information Assymetries
In order to have a functioning market for healthcare goods and services, patients need information about the quality of services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, such information is mixed in quality. Why? Quality measures capture only a small fraction of the clinical scenarios that are relevant to patients. There are literally 100,000s of different clincial scenarios and it is near impossible to measure the skill/capability of a clinician or health system at managing all of these clinical scenarios. Averages may/may not be helpful fo patients in understanding whether a clinician or health system is best at managing their particular scenarios. While there have been efforts to introduce greater transparency, these efforts are surface level at best""not for lack of effort, but because it is so complex. And there remains more art than science in many clinical scenarious making defining a ""gold standard"" very difficult.
Do you still believe ""consumerism"" can fix what ails American healthcare?",Supply chain

"#WorldCancerDay2023 focuses on closing the gap in cancer care and achieving health equity.
Today, many cancers can be prevented, treated and even cured. However 50% of the world's population lacks access to essential health services.
At Roche, we are committed to closing the care gap and empowering those who work with us to do the same. Together, we are partnering with the global healthcare community to bring us closer to the goal of advancing cancer care for all patients, everywhere. Additionally, we believe in technology and the power of data as key drivers to advance research, generate insights and thus accelerate our impact to prevent and provide cures for cancer in all its forms.

"Roche published its full-year results for 2022 today - we achieved good results even though the demand for COVID-19 products declined, as expected. The diagnostics base business and our newer medicines continued their strong growth. For the current year we expect solid underlying growth in both divisions, which will largely compensate for the further drop in sales of roughly CHF 5 billion in COVID-19 products.
I invite you to take a journey through our business year in 2022 and uncover in our newly released annual report how our teams brought meaningful change to millions of patients around the world by, for example, bringing two new medicines to patients: Vabysmo for certain severe eye diseases and Lunsumio for a currently incurable form of blood cancer.

Under this agreement, by January 2024, our oral treatment will be offered through commercial channels, not just the emergency federal channels created and used by the US government during the pandemic. As a result, more pharmacies, clinics and other healthcare sites are expected to be able to stock this treatment, making it more accessible for eligible patients across the US.
In addition, on behalf of the federal government, Pfizer will set up a patient assistance program for the uninsured and underinsured through 2028. Patients insured through federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive treatment free of charge in 2024.

"Atrial fibrillation is heart failure's dangerous partner. Afib's rapid and irregular heart rhythm affects more than 37 million people around the world, increasing their risk of stroke, heart failure, and other coronary diseases. At the annual Heart Rhythm Society conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, I met with electrophysiologists and researchers to learn more about how we are innovating to address this unmet healthcare need. Johnson & Johnson is at the forefront of cardiac ablation, which uses a catheter to deliver high-energy pulses inside the heart to correct malfunctioning pathways that cause it to beat out of rhythm. This is particularly helpful for patients who can't tolerate pharmaceutical treatments, but it isn't without risk, which is why we are always looking to improve standards of care. As I did, physicians who visited our booth experimented with our latest ablation catheters that deliver higher-powered pulses lasting up to four seconds, compared to pulses of 20 seconds or longer.
The shorter procedures could improve patient outcomes and increase patient access by allowing doctors to perform more procedures per day.
Together, our dedicated teams of innovators in MedTech are determined to develop tools that will profoundly impact the lives of millions of people living with Afib.",Health outcomes

"One of the things that most excites me about AI is the profound impact it could have on people's health - whether it's improving access; reducing diagnosis times or helping us beat diseases altogether.
To mark the recent Africa HealthTech Summit in Kigali, Rwanda - an event that brings together digital health innovators and public health experts to transform the healthcare landscape in Africa - my colleagues Yossi & Shravya have pulled together five ways we're working with organisations and partners across Africa to research and explore new AI-powered healthcare tools. You can read the full list below - but some of my favourites are:
azi  50% of pregnant people in low-resource settings do not receive ultrasound screenings during pregnancy - despite them being so important in identifying potential issues. We're working with Jacaranda Health, a Kenyan nonprofit, to change that: looking at how AI can enable providers to accurately administer and interpret an ultrasound - moving the needle on maternal and newborn mortality rates. (The video on this, in the blog below, is well worth a watch).
azi  Tuberculosis is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, with over 25% of TB deaths occurring in Africa. TB is treatable, but requires cost-effective screening solutions to catch it early and before it spreads to an entire community. This year, Google partnered with a newly formed consortium of African-based entities to introduce AI-powered screenings across Sub-Saharan Africa. Working with clinical and research partner Right to Care, we're dedicated to providing 100,000 free AI-powered TB screenings.
azi  To support innovators around the world, Google.org earlier announced the funding recipients of our ""AI for the Global Goals"" - $25 million in support to organisations around the world using AI to accelerate progress towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Of the 15 organisations, a third are using AI to improve health outcomes. Read more about them below!

We did this through literature review, expert interviews, and formation of a testable theory of change and measures under guidance of an expert panel.
Phase 2 is next. We'll be working with up to five health care systems in a Learning and Action Prototyping Network to test and refine our theory of change. Under the guidance of subject matter and improvement science experts, participating organizations will test and implement solutions that lead to local improvements for patients and colleagues, and have the potential to transform nursing and nursing care on a larger scale.

"I worry that approaches like this (billing for some electronic health communications) de-incentivize clinician-patient interaction, especially when the cost is put on the #patient instead of being borne by our payers.
But more than that, I worry that we're getting caught up in the weeds while the biggest question remains...
When are we going to say enough already with this ridiculous transactional system of #FeeForService medicine?
The medical emails that this article talks about account for 1-1.5% of all clinician-patient ""email"" threads. The revenue generated is a drop in the bucket. And alleviated 1% of our inboxes as docs isn't going to solve the burnout or turnover problems we face.
But, what happens when patients with complex needs stop messaging their clinicians because they're afraid of incurring a bill?
They don't get the information they need to manage their care, their condition worsens, and they wind up in the #ER "" the most expensive setting in a health system. No one wins.
But, a #HealthSystem that's built on relationships and is managing costs on a capitated basis can promote engagement and dialogue with patients. Because studies have shown time and again that consistent, effective patient-clinician communication is associated with better health outcomes and often lower costs.
A health system in a value-based environment is incentivized to staff an inbox or implement a virtual hotline, because they know that consistent communication is linked to better outcomes and that's the basis on which the institution is paid/rewarded. Frankly such a system just allows doctors and nurses to spend the time needed with their patients to build relationships and mitigate high cost health risks.
On the other hand, poor communication and lack of interaction between patients and clinicians are known contributors to #disparities and deepen distrust in health care. And that's exactly what we're going to do with these absurd charges for emails. We're going to make it harder for patients to communicate with their clinicians and it's going to lead to less access and less needed care. We cannot allow this to happen. Trust is an essential element in advancing #HealthEquity.
So, let's put an end to the madness.
Let's make value-based payment infrastructure ubiquitous.
Let's incentivize communication and evidence-based approaches that improve #PatientExperience, improve #PopulationHealth, and reduce the per capita cost of health care. We know the way. We just need the will. Who's with me? #QI",Health outcomes

"I shared my thoughts on the state of the healthcare industry with David Raths.
On the Medicare Advantage v. FFS Medicare
The truth is that we've failed on some level. The way I know that we've failed is that we've been engaged in the zero-sum debates about whether Medicare Advantage is better or fee-for-service Medicare is better. I would say if our industry had done its job, we would have settled those debates a decade ago. When we used to talk about the move to value, we talked about your feet being in multiple canoes moving in different directions. Now we've got 10 boats and we've got for only two feet and two arms, and we're trying to be in all boats. And some organizations are finding themselves falling into the water as a result, because there are so many different payment programs that have slightly different rules, incentives and models. We talk a lot about harmonizing benefits, but it doesn't really work that way.
On Biopharma Innovation and the Limitations of Annual Enrollment
I used to work at Merck, and I think about all my former biotech colleagues and pharma colleagues, who are inventing truly amazing things, but they're expensive. The total lifetime cost for someone with severe sickle cell disease is in the millions of dollars because of all the pain crises and the hospital admissions that these folks experience. If you know a patient with bad sickle cell disease is bouncing to and from the hospital and emergency room, and you have a cure that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to administer, you want to be able to pay for that and know that there's going to be some return on it. But unfortunately, I can cure you tomorrow, pay for your cure, and then next year, you can switch insurance or jobs and switch insurance. So there's a natural resistance within the system to funding things that have longer payback periods.
On Inauthenticity
""One observation is that I think we have normalized inauthenticity. We talk about changing lives and we talk about improving lives and commitment to community and being better and supporting people and then you look at some of our industry's actions: we're putting people in a medical debt we talk about the benefits for social determinants of health, but then we put real barriers in front of people to actually access those benefits.
I think we've normalized inauthenticity. We make ourselves feel better to some extent by talking about all the small things that we do to make a small number of people's lives better, but the reality is that we've participated in complexifying the U.S. healthcare system to the point where we've eroded trust with people and communities, and I think it's time to turn it around.""",Health outcomes
"Two days ago, a woman approached me as I was taking out the trash. She introduced herself as the sister of my next door neighbor.
Neighbor's sister: ""I understand that you are the president of SCAN.""
Me: ""Uhm, yes."" I was nervous about where this might go. Conversations starting out this way mostly go very well but occasionally go sideways fast.
Neighbor's sister: ""Are you guys in Arizona?""
Me: ""Yes, we have been in Arizona for two years now. In Phoenix and Tucson. Why do you ask?""
Neighbor's sister: ""Your Embrace team has done an amazing job with my husband. He has dementia and lives in a memory care unit and the weekly visits from Liz, the nurse practitioner, give me a lot of comfort and support. He's declining. I don't want to move anywhere that you guys aren't. Are you in Northern California?""
(Embrace is our institutional special needs plan [ISNP] for home and institution bound patients)
Sometimes we all doubt whether we are making a difference. Whether the words we say and the programs we build truly translate into the difference we set out to make.
When we launched our ISNP two years ago, our teams (led initially by Payam Parvinchiha, MD, MPH, Lisa Hildreth, Benjamin Ware, MD, Alyssa Rios and other great leaders""and now also by Gabe Waterman, MD, MBA, Daniel Croymans, MD, MBA, Sheerali Patel PharmD, BCPS) set out to build something special and different that provided direct care to members with the highest clinical care.
We are deliberately hard on ourselves and need to be even harder on the path to clinical excellence. We have grown quickly and occasionally stumbled. We continue to feel instinctively that we can be even better.
But this random interaction affirmed that we are on path to build and scale a clinical model of care to which every home and institution-bound older adult should have access.
The fact that even one person was making a life decision as profound as moving based on the presence of our health plan and our clinical teams""was as gratifying a feeling as I have had in a long time.
It was also a reminder that critics of Medicare Advantage often don't see some of the unique innovations that are enabled by prepayment.
Every Embrace patient has access to:
1) an employed nurse practitioner and primary care doctor who visits them on the home on a regular basis (sometimes weekly or daily if necessary)
2) a case manager and/or social worker who facilitates transitions of care and ensures that frail and demented patients don't spend more time than they need to in hospitals
3) a pharmacist who works consistently to identify opportunities to optimize their medication regimens
4) on-site, in-home diagnostics and specialist consultations to help avoid confusing, unnecessary visits to medical care settings.
It's hard to understand the difference programs like this make until you see them in action.

"To achieve true ""value-based care,"" healthcare organizations need to be able to think about and invest in patient health for longer periods than in 1-year cycles.
There is nothing magical about 365 days. It takes far longer to achieve meaningful (and lasting) improvements in health.
What if health insurance products like Medicare Advantage were sold with 3-year enrollment cycles?
Measurement systems like STAR ratings could be based on true health improvements over 3-year cycles rather than check-box measures presently included in most quality rating systems.
Plans and medical groups could invest in building true and deep relationships with patients rather than gimmicky relationships based on short-term benefit offers.

Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, highlights the findings from a recent study shared at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2023 Conference.
""In terms of selecting the best course of radiation treatment post mastectomy, the results of the first-of-its-kind, FABREC study were just presented at ASTRO. This was a randomized comparison across multiple institutions of standard fractionation (25) versus shorter course (16) in the post mastectomy setting. With an average follow up for five years, the results reflected equivalence. This will allow patients to complete their course of therapy in a shorter amount of time, as well as having fewer side effects. Skin toxicity in late term fibrosis are also substantially better with shorter fractionation as demonstrated in the study.""

Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, highlights the findings from a recent study shared at the 2023 ASTRO Plenary session.
""The results of the CASE B study from the UK were presented at the ASTRO Plenary this year. This was a randomized comparison of standard fractionation to five fraction stereotactic radiotherapy. The results reflected equivalence with several years medium follow up demonstrating that shorter course fractionation can safely be offered to patients with low risk or low-intermediate disease. This will result in a substantial reduction of unnecessary therapy and will also give patients the opportunity to complete their course of treatment without multiple trips to a treatment facility.""

"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
""For early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
""Additionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.""

"Radiation Therapy: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, reducing the number of fractions a patient receives can minimize toxicity to the patient while offering the same efficacy. However, it is still common for providers to order a course of fractionation outside of published, evidence-based guidelines.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his insight on the benefits of reduced fractionation for patients being treated for bone metastasis.
""ASTRO guidelines recommend one to five fractions for management of bone mets. Providers routinely treat with 10 fractions or more in many clinical circumstances resulting in increased toxicity to the patient such as erythema and reduction of bone marrow burden. Conversion of treatment of bone metastasis from 10 fractions to five or one fraction is reflective of the ASTRO guidelines and helps minimize the potential negative side effects for the patient.""

"Demographic shifts lead to an uptick in imaging utilization.
A study in the American Journal of Roentgenology titled ""Spending on Medical Imaging by Age and Gender in the U.S. Population With Employer-Sponsored Insurance"" observed that imaging utilization increased with age until approximately age 80-85.
As recorded in the study and based on US Census data, the largest population growth is ""projected among individuals 40 to 50 years old and 65 years old and up"" pointing to the eventuality of increased imaging use amongst this cohort.
As utilization grows, payers should review their imaging guidelines and consider managed programs that provide ordering physicians with the latest evidence-based medical criteria through consultations with sub-specialists at leading academic departments to ensure that the appropriate testing is performed, resulting in the best possible outcome for the member.

"Prostate Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
Prostate cancer treatment remains a topic of debate amongst oncologists. The use of radiation therapy, in particular, can be a subject of controversy.
Very often, radiation therapy is recommended when ""watchful waiting"" may be a viable, if not preferred, option.
""Patients with low-risk prostate cancer should always be offered the choice of omission and watchful waiting. This approach is more common globally but less so in the United States,"" states Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a board-certified Radiation Oncologist, who currently serves as a Faculty Physician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
""Why is this important? It's not just about reducing unnecessary harm and toxicity from radiation. It's also about cost savings from avoiding unnecessary treatments.""

"Musculoskeletal pain effects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. Back pain alone is the leading cause of disability for individuals under 45 years old with 80% of all adults reporting some degree of pain in their lifetime.
With such a significant portion of the population affected by Musculoskeletal pain, treatment can be very complex and determining the best care pathway can pose challenges for physicians. These challenges can prevent patients from receiving optimal care and drive up healthcare costs.
HealthHelp's approach to managing musculoskeletal procedures is built around a multidisciplinary and episode based approach. This approach reduces unnecessary care by educating physicians on appropriate care pathways and the causes of inappropriate treatments. The education and peer collaboration provided through the HealthHelp model is essential to ensure optimal outcomes for patients.
