Too many companies have treated cybersecurity as a nice-to-have, not a must get done. Now itâ€™s abundantly clear that corporate leaders are responsible for the cybersecurity of their organizations.
When cyber breaches have material impact, investors have the right to know about an organizationâ€™s cyber risk management pactices. This is a dramatic step toward greater transparency and accountability and will greatly improve our cybersecurity preparedness as a nation. The SECâ€™s rule will force what companies should have been implementing all along; informed cyber risk management practices.

"Last week we were privileged to host a dinner featuring a select group of startup leaders operating at the cutting edge of GenAI. While the conversation was lively and wide-ranging, we honed in on what some of the core implications for modern enterprises would be. Here were 3 key takeaways:
1) The path to widespread AI adoption in enterprises will likely take 2 to 5 years. Currently, there is a lot of enterprise experimentation with applications where hallucinations remain an issue. Additionally, there are challenges with scaling infrastructure to meet large-scale adoption. 2) We are still in the early days of figuring out what we can do with this technology similar to the early days of the Apple app store where the current set of GenAI applications are not necessarily revolutionary. The more interesting use cases are still to come. As a result, emerging players will have to help enterprises learn where and how to adopt these new applications, plus define their outcomes and return on investment. 3) For company builders, governance and safety need to be a bottom-up priority where you are able to respond to the evolving regulatory landscape. However, determining the appropriate regulations for GenAI is difficult because predicting the societal risks at the burgeoning stages of AI is akin to predicting the risks of social media at its onset in the early 2010s.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geodesiccapital_last-week-we-were-privileged-to-host-a-dinner-ugcPost-7132463165023420416-vDdx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop,Data privacy and cybersecurity

Weâ€™ve been living and working in new ways for over three years, and we know people, devices, workloads, and applications will continue to be more and more distributed moving forward. Organizations are accelerating their multi-cloud adoption more quickly than many expected. In this dynamic environment, a number of my peers have expressed that they donâ€™t worry about if a breach will happen, but when.
But despite so much uncertainty, I remain optimistic. I believe the data highlights the opportunities that exist for the public and private sectors to work together to close the readiness gap. With tighter alignment and partnership, we can truly reap all the benefits of our connected world, without fear of disruption. We all depend on a secure world, and if we share threat intelligence, cooperate on legislation to keep everyone safe, and rally around the idea that security and privacy are human rights, we can realize a truly secure and inclusive future for all.
As the builders of the internet, security remains critical for Ciscoâ€™s business and our ability to support our customersâ€™ resilience. Our team is dedicated to building the simple, intelligent, interoperable, and platform-driven solutions our customers demand today and will need tomorrow. Youâ€™ll be hearing more from us in the weeks and months to come, and Iâ€™m so excited about whatâ€™s ahead for Cisco and security.

"Wrapping up an incredible week in Europe! After Mobile World Congress, I traveled to London and Brussels. It was fantastic to engage with both customers and government leaders on critical topics for the region like cybersecurity, digital #skills, and Ciscoâ€™s support of Ukraine.
In addition to many other impactful government meetings in Brussels, I had the opportunity to meet European Commission VP Margaritis Schinas and we announced that Cisco will train 250,000 people in #cybersecurity skills over the next three years through our Cisco Networking Academy program. This is just one way we are continuing to address the cyber skills gap and train the workforce to address the constantly evolving threat landscape. You can learn more here: https://lnkd.in/emN8bRe5
As always, nothing energizes me more than being back with our employees! I was thrilled to have the opportunity to host All Hands with our teams in the UK and Ireland, as well as Belgium and Luxembourg. For both meetings, we had employees joining us in-person, as well as virtually from across the region. Our teams asked thoughtful questions about our business and culture, and we had a lot of fun getting together!

"This week, we are hosting over 9000 customers in Amsterdam for #CiscoLiveEMEA. While I wasnâ€™t able to attend in-person, our teams have shared incredible #innovation across #security and networking, #sustainability, and skills. Here are a few of the highlights!
Security is a top priority for Cisco and our global customers, and we introduced new risk-based capabilities across our security portfolio to protect multi-cloud environments. We believe Risk-Based Authentication and our industry-first Business Risk Observability Platform will both be game-changers for our customers.
We also know that customers are extending their networks to new places, while looking to simplify their IT operations. We announced new cloud management tools for industrial #IoT applications, a simplified dashboard to converge IT and OT operations, and flexible network intelligence across all industrial assets, all aimed at keeping our customers as agile as possible.
Iâ€™ve talked many times about our commitment to building sustainability into our technology products to help our customers achieve their own goals. Soon, Carbon Emissions Insights in Webex Control Hub will provide collaboration customers with Scope 2 emissions data and recommendations for optimizing energy consumption.
Finally, we continue to be focused on promoting digital skills through our Networking Academy program. This week, we shared our goal to train 10M people across EMEA in digital and cybersecurity skills over the next 10 years, as part of our plan to train 25M people worldwide in the same timeframe.

"This week, members of Ciscoâ€™s executive team and I had the opportunity to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, and before heading home, I stopped by to visit our customers and employees in Copenhagen.
In Davos, we connected with a number of Cisco customers and government leaders from around the globe and discussed many of the challenges we are all facing. The good news is, it was incredibly clear that #technology is more important than ever and customers in all industries, as well as governments, will continue to invest in building out their technology strategies to be more resilient in the future.
I spoke on two panels - one with Francine Katsoudas and Shelley Zalis, CEO of The Female Quotient, on resilient leadership and another on the increasing importance of #cybersecurity. In particular, the theme of cybersecurity was a part of nearly every one of my conversations throughout the week, and Iâ€™m
excited for all that Cisco can continue to do to secure the world.
I was also honored to attend a small roundtable with
Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska and other business leaders. I left that meeting inspired to do more to help them begin to rebuild and am working on plans for how Cisco can continue to have a positive impact for the people of Ukraine.
â€” In Copenhagen, we had the chance to connect with customers and government officials to learn more about the opportunities to
continue to digitize Denmark. I also had the privilege to speak at the AmCham Denmark New Yearâ€™s reception and chat with the US Ambassador to Denmark, as well as local leaders from both Danish and American companies, about the importance of the priorities in the country and their plans for the future.
I also hosted my first in-person Town Hall of the year with our fantastic Denmark team. Jeff Sharritts, Mark Patterson, and I had the chance to answer a number of insightful questions, and itâ€™s always a pleasure hearing the perspectives from our teams in the region.

"Edge Computing is a distributed computing standard that focuses on processing and storing data closer to the source of data generation, such as IoT devices or local servers. By doing so, it reduces the need to rely solely on centralized data centers or cloud services for data processing.
This approach offers several benefits, including reduced latency, improved processing speed, and enhanced data privacy. It can help optimize and enable faster, more efficient use of real-time data analytics to drive informed decision-making.
Additionally, Edge Computing can improve data security and privacy by reducing the amount of sensitive information transmitted and stored in centralized locations, which is particularly important in today's increasingly regulated digital landscape.

"Cyber attackers would LOVE to get ahold of your data, here are some ways that they will try to take advantage of you on Valentineâ€™s Day:
- Phishing Scams: Cyber criminals may use Valentine's Day themes in phishing scams to trick people into revealing their personal and financial information. For example, they may send emails posing as a flower delivery service or a popular retailer, asking for login credentials or credit card information.
- Malicious Websites: People searching for Valentine's Day gifts or deals may inadvertently visit malicious websites that have been set up to spread malware or steal personal information.
- Fake Apps: People may download fake apps claiming to offer romantic gestures or special deals, but in reality, they may steal personal information or install malware.
- Social Media Scams: Cyber criminals may use social media platforms to spread Valentine's Day scams, such as fake giveaways or contests, in an attempt to trick people into sharing their personal information or handing over money.

"As a person who often travels for work and uses my laptop to close out some work on a flight, here are a few things to think about:
Use a privacy screen filter: A privacy screen filter is a thin, plastic film that you can place over your laptop or mobile device screen. It obscures the view of your screen from anyone who is not directly in front of it, making it difficult for people sitting next to you or behind you to see what you're doing.
Adjust your screen brightness: By turning down the brightness of your screen, you can make it more difficult for others to see what's on your screen. This is especially useful if you're working on sensitive or confidential information.
Use a VPN: When you're traveling and using public Wi-Fi on a plane, your internet connection may not be secure. To keep your data and online activities private, you can use a corporate VPN.

But we've always said that to have a healthy economy, everyone must have the opportunity to participate. That's why for years we've been focused on digital skills training, delivering free training to more than 1 million Brits in more than 500 locations across the UK since 2015.
Today, we're expanding our digital skills training to include AI - and offering new, free AI training to everyone in the UK. Our new AI-focused New Fundamentals training series offers people and businesses practical skills and knowledge to capture the benefits of AI, whether it's to save time, get a new job or grow their business. Google experts have designed 10 easy to follow modules that are packed with practical advice and tips focused on essential AI skills, including two that launch today:
âž¡ Grow your Productivity with AI: An introduction, for everyone, to the smartest ways AI tools can save you time. It includes an explanation of what AI is, how it already helps out in everyday products, what Large Language Models are and what they can do, and how to be much more productive with AI - from brainstorming new ideas, to writing code, or reducing the burden of administrative tasks; and
âž¡ Understanding Machine Learning: A module designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses leaders, this course teaches the potential of machine learning to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and drive growth. According to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), only 2% of British small and medium-sized businesses are using machine learning tools: so there's huge potential to expand.
Yesterday Google leaders Debbie W. and Ruth Porat, SVP and CFO Google and Alphabet, joined 85 enthusiastic learners - the first to complete the training - at a Google Digital Garage event. And we're excited to release the next eight modules in the coming weeks, covering topics like how to use data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and leadership in a digital world â€“ skills and expertise needed to run an AI-enabled business.

In his remarks, Seth emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships and information sharing in combating cyber threats: ""We think it's only beneficial to everybody to have a very tight public-private partnership and collaborate and work on this massive problem together that is only getting bigger, more sophisticated, more real-time and drives the need for tremendous collaboration and communication.""

"Itâ€™s an honour to be taking on the role of President at the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations today.
This is a critical time for our industry in Europe. With a new EU pharmaceutical legislation on its way, thereâ€™s a lot at stake. Together with my new colleagues in the Presidency, Stefan Oelrich from Bayer | Pharmaceuticals and David Loew from Ipsen we hosted a press conference today to share our concerns with the current proposal. Our message is clear - if not revised, it will harm access to medical breakthroughs for #europeans. We want to play our part in ensuring a #healthier Europe, but we need the regulatory framework to be globally #competitive and #resilient. Here we face challenges: Europe is losing ground in R&D â€“ the lifeblood of our industry - with investments flowing more rapidly elsewhere. Now, more than ever, our sector needs the right policy framework and regulatory environment alongside excellence in #science and #skills , if weâ€™re to help change the trajectory of Europe for the better. EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission share the same goal. We want to increase patient access to medicines across Europe and strengthen the competitiveness of our pharma sector. But, in our view, the proposal from the Commission risks undermining this goal in some important ways. Crucially, regulatory data protection need to be strengthened, rather than cut, to close the competitiveness gap. I believe in the potential of Europe, and I believe in the potential of our sector. In my time as the President of EFPIA, I am committed to working in partnership with our stakeholders to help fulfil this potential.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/larsfruergaard_dialogue-activity-7075514355689107457-jCG4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop,Data privacy and cybersecurity

"#ArtificialIntelligence has the potential to transform the health sector. Clinical trials; medical diagnosis, treatment, self-care and person-centred care; and supplementing health care professionalsâ€™ knowledge, skills and competencies - these are all areas that hashtag#AI could enhance. Here is one example: AI could be beneficial in settings where there is a lack of medical specialists, e.g. in interpreting retinal scans and radiology images, among many others.
However, AI technologies are being rapidly deployed, sometimes without a full understanding of how they may perform, which could either benefit or harm end-users, including health-care professionals and patients. Recognising the potential and risks of AI, the World Health Organization published regulatory considerations on AI for health, covering the following aspects:
1) the importance of transparency and documentation
2) risk management, including cybersecurity threats
3) intended use and analytical and clinical validation
4) data quality
5) privacy and data protection
6) collaboration between stakeholders to ensure products and services stay compliant with regulation throughout their lifecycles
