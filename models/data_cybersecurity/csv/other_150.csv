"It was a pleasure to be part of Roche's LinkedIn Live Digital InnoLAB TechTalk earlier this week. I was impressed that more than 1000 people joined the event and followed the discussion on the topic of purpose-driven companies. Thank you to Stephanie Sassman and Professor George Serafeim for the great talk and for bringing unique perspectives from Women's Health as well as research to the table! Big thanks also to the organizing team, very well done!
One of the most important topics we discussed was purpose versus profit which actually is purpose AND profit. My key takeaway for Roche and our industry is that if we want to make healthcare sustainable, we need profits in order to fund R&D. Without profits, we cannot invest and ensure we are doing now what patients need next. Moreover, purpose needs to have an exciting and energizing element. I look forward to continuing the conversation!

"Take a moment to read through the findings of America's Health Rankings Annual Report, just released by the United Health Foundation this morning. It shows the prevalence of eight chronic conditions in the U.S. is higher than itâ€™s been in the reportâ€™s history. Conditions like diabetes, depression and cancer that impact the lives of millions of people each day and remain a focal point for health disparities across the country. Itâ€™s a sobering reminder for anyone working in health care. And itâ€™s just one of the many reasons we are working to build a health system equipped to treat the people who need us most. https://lnkd.in/gSJEgRhh",Health outcomes

"Divorce changes pretty much everything. Whether itâ€™s a surprise or something youâ€™re both on board with, youâ€™ve gone from a â€œweâ€ to a â€œme"" â€” and that can take some getting used to.
Maybe you were involved in the family finances while you were married, or maybe not. Either way, now the checkbook is in your hands. And that checkbook may look different than what you expected.
Why? Frustratingly, research shows that womenâ€™s household income falls almost twice as much as menâ€™s post-split. And divorce can affect womenâ€™s money in a lot of other ways, too.
Thatâ€™s a lot. And dealing with it is also pretty urgent. Financial instability is stressful and disruptive (especially if youâ€™re in a pretty emotional place right now).
That's why the Ellevest team put together a post-divorce guide at the link below. Our all-woman team of financial advisors has helped thousands of women model out the impact of a divorce settlement and what it â€Œmeans for their finances before itâ€™s too late.",MISC

SCANâ€™s strength is in the Medicare program, where we have 6 years straight of 4.5 Star performance (a feat accomplished by only 2 other plans in the country).
CareOregonâ€™s strength is in the Medicaid program where it has received national accolades for its patient-centered approach to serving the physical and behavioral health needs of people that society has too often forgotten.

"I don't believe that Elon will do well with his investment in Twitter.
But it is impossible to deny his incredible impact on the world as the driving force behind Tesla and SpaceX. And he may be just getting started. I think most of the media missed the point with last week's Starship launch by deeming it a failure, when it was really a remarkable existence proof and very promising for the future.
In essence, it demonstrated a leap frog in rocket payload and efficiency, which when perfected would enable human travel to Mars and radical transformation of cross ocean airfreight. The first 30 minutes of the last episode of the All-In Pod covered this and included a SpaceX board member. I really recommend listening - such a refreshing, optimistic lens on human ingenuity, commitment and the final frontier.

"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. President Trumanâ€”the first presidential champion of Medicareâ€”was in attendance to witness. The program was seen at the time as a major anti-poverty program for older adults. I sometimes think about what President Truman and Johnson would think of the program that they created. This morning, Don Berwick moderated a dialog between me and Rick Gilfillan about the future of the Medicare Advantage program for the IHI Leadership Alliance. I was grateful for a respectful dialog with two mentors I admire and used the opportunity to articulate some changes that I believe will make Medicare Advantage a better program for older adults:
1) Standardized, regulated benefits - plans should compete on quality of administration, not on gimmicky benefits with low utilization rates.
2) Longer enrollment periods - annual enrollment disables a true focus on investing in chronic disease prevention and management
3) Reform of STAR rating program - high star ratings translate into higher payments to plans and higher benefits. Plans have built in disincentives to serve more complex patients and populations because higher star ratings are harder to achieve with more complex populations. 4) New methods for risk adjustment that are aligned with 2023 technologies - CMS should test machine learning models of risk adjustment that iteratively reward plans for true risk rather than expected risk. 5) More clearly articulated clinical requirements - CMS should articulate stronger clincial guidelines around accesss to care to ensure that no corners are caught in the care of patients.
Critics of Medicare Advantare would have us throw the baby out with bath water. Itâ€™s a complicated program with good actors and bad actorsâ€”and unintended consequences. Like every single other health policy. That said, it provides an incredible amount of security to older adults who are on a fixed incomeâ€”hence its popularity. Traditional Medicare pushes a sizable cost share on to older adults (whose average pretax income is $48,000) who are often unable to bear the expense of copays (20% of most office visits and $1600 for any hospitalization). Traditional Medicare requires literal acts of Congress (Congress!) to introduce new benefits. There was no prescription drug coverage until 2004 (2004!). There is still no vision, dental, or hearing coverage in traditional Medicare. ACOs may lower total costs of care but they do little to lower costs for beneficiary-save reducing their utilization of services some. President Truman and President Johnson wanted a Medicare program that gave older adults financial security and health coverage in their Golden years. Letâ€™s keep working to build a better Medicare program and give them that.",Health Insurance

As a patient myself, Iâ€™ve had very negative personal experiences with prior authorization trying to get needed diagnostic evaluations.

All three will be necessary to get out of the administrative waste nightmare that has befallen the medical profession.

SFO has two waiting lots, each about a mile away from the terminal. Each typically has 50 or so drivers waiting. Pictured below are two: Abdul, a long-time Lyft driver originally from Afghanistan, and Adele, three months in-- and very excited about our new Women+Connect feature that lets her pick up more women riders!
The Lyft Driver app estimates how long you'll have to wait, and how many people are ahead of you in the queue. You can choose to match with riders who are headed the way you want to go, so you don't end up 50 miles away from home. Because I drive an EV, I'm eligible for an EV bonus on top of the base earnings-- we're working to make EVs more attractive, to lower air pollution and Lyft's carbon footprint.
I waited 13 minutes, chatting with other drivers, then got an alert asking if I was ready to exit the queue and head towards the garage. Started driving, and about halfway there got matched with Christine. She'd just returned home from an enjoyable Thanksgiving with her parents in LA. Turns out she's a researcher digging into how certain pharmaceuticals interact with foods, possibly changing their effectiveness. Overall, a great experience. As always, I drive to learn not to earn. Really enjoyed getting to know a few drivers along the way!",MISC

My Grandmother (Maneck-ben): Early 1900â€™s, she became one of the first literate women in her village with the help of a home tutor. Encouraged her daughters.
My Aunt (Guni-masi): Engaged in high school (customary)â€¦ Her Fianceâ€™s grandparents recognized her potential, postponed wedding (breaking tradition) and encouraged/supported her to go to medical school â€¦ Graduated 1st in her class and the only womanâ€¦. Treated many underprivileged people in her career
My mom (Niroo): Excelled math and sciences at a young ageâ€¦ Followed her big sisterâ€¦ Slept in the day and studied at night so she could concentrate in a humble crowded apartmentâ€¦ 1st woman in family to leave India to persue medicine in the USâ€¦ coming alone in early 1970sâ€¦ Dedicated her career to pharma research bringing critical drugs to market.
A small opportunity for education + belief and bravery to break tradition + willpower to peruse a dream
Has equaled === tremendous amounts of opportunities for me, my sister @monisha iyer, and so manyâ€¦
My daughters and nieces now add to this equation in their own way.
Digital inequality is something that I am privately learning about and supportingâ€¦ 1/3 of the world does not have access to internet with women up to 50% less likely to be using the internet than men.

"One of my favorite things about private equity is the opportunity to bring great teams of innovators together to create great companies. When we combined complementary financial technology leaders AxiomSL and Calypso two years ago to create Adenza with Didier B. at the helm, we knew we were building something really special. Independently, each company had a best-of-breed product in a large and growing market; together, the company was among the best software franchises weâ€™ve had the privilege of owning. We brought Thoma Bravoâ€™s operational and software expertise to bear to accelerate growth, improve operations and provide customers with a comprehensive platform to help navigate their highly complicated digital transformations alongside an ever-evolving regulatory landscape.
Today, Nasdaq announced a definitive agreement to acquire Adenza. We have long-admired Nasdaq and the transformation theyâ€™ve undergone under Adena Friedmanâ€™s leadership â€“ from organic initiatives to a number of acquisitions, Nasdaq has cemented its position as one of the most important and trusted financial technology providers in the world. The addition of Adenzaâ€™s platform will deepen Nasdaqâ€™s global suite of mission-critical financial technology solutions, enhancing its ability to solve the most complex challenges financial institutions face across risk, regulation and capital markets. This acquisition accelerates Nasdaqâ€™s vision to become the trusted fabric of the financial system, delivering platforms to improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy.
Since 1971, when Nasdaq created the worldâ€™s first electronic exchange, their innovations have revolutionized the global capital markets and overall financial system, making them the perfect partner for Adenza in this next phase of their journey. And Iâ€™m excited that we get to continue to be a part of it; at the close of the transaction, Thoma Bravo will become a shareholder in Nasdaq and I expect to join the companyâ€™s Board of Directors.
This transaction is an endorsement of what we have built together in a relatively short period of time and a testament to the dedication of the Adenza team. Huge thanks to Didier Bouillard and his team, J. Charles Goodman, Erik Akopiantz, Kristin Nimsger Weston, Brian Jaffee, Jamie Hutter and the rest of the Thoma Bravo team for making this possible. I look forward to continued partnership with Adenza and leveraging our 20+ years of software and technology experience to support the Nasdaq team to drive further innovation and digital transformation across the global financial system.

This new Executive Orderâ€™s focus on the federal governmentâ€™s use and procurement of AI systems is critical, as its massive purchasing power can set the bar for adopting trustworthy AI. Weâ€™re pleased that this Executive Order creates new opportunities for innovation and research, regarding the safety and risk-management of AI foundation models. But we also believe the best way to address potential AI safety concerns is through open innovation. A robust open-source ecosystem with a diversity of voices - including creators, developers, and academics - will help rapidly advance the science of AI safety and foster competition in the marketplace. For over a century, IBM has been at the forefront of introducing powerful technologies while prioritizing safety and security. Through our commitment to responsible AI, IBM is uniquely positioned to help government agencies adopt AI in ways that are responsible, trusted and a real benefit for the American people.
Todayâ€™s order is just the beginning as we ensure the responsible use of #AI across the federal government. IBM welcomes Congressâ€™ focus on AI as well, and we are pleased to participate in forums like the recent AI Insight Forum hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, as we advocate for a risk-based approach to AI regulation that will provide firm guardrails for protecting society while ensuring America continues as the world leader in AI innovation and open-source development.",MISC
"I worry that approaches like this (billing for some electronic health communications) de-incentivize clinician-patient interaction, especially when the cost is put on the #patient instead of being borne by our payers.
But more than that, I worry that weâ€™re getting caught up in the weeds while the biggest question remains...
When are we going to say enough already with this ridiculous transactional system of #FeeForService medicine?
The medical emails that this article talks about account for 1-1.5% of all clinician-patient â€œemailâ€ threads. The revenue generated is a drop in the bucket. And alleviated 1% of our inboxes as docs isnâ€™t going to solve the burnout or turnover problems we face.
But, what happens when patients with complex needs stop messaging their clinicians because theyâ€™re afraid of incurring a bill?
They donâ€™t get the information they need to manage their care, their condition worsens, and they wind up in the #ER â€“ the most expensive setting in a health system. No one wins.
But, a #HealthSystem that's built on relationships and is managing costs on a capitated basis can promote engagement and dialogue with patients. Because studies have shown time and again that consistent, effective patient-clinician communication is associated with better health outcomes and often lower costs.
A health system in a value-based environment is incentivized to staff an inbox or implement a virtual hotline, because they know that consistent communication is linked to better outcomes and that's the basis on which the institution is paid/rewarded. Frankly such a system just allows doctors and nurses to spend the time needed with their patients to build relationships and mitigate high cost health risks.
On the other hand, poor communication and lack of interaction between patients and clinicians are known contributors to #disparities and deepen distrust in health care. And thatâ€™s exactly what weâ€™re going to do with these absurd charges for emails. Weâ€™re going to make it harder for patients to communicate with their clinicians and itâ€™s going to lead to less access and less needed care. We cannot allow this to happen. Trust is an essential element in advancing #HealthEquity.
So, let's put an end to the madness.
Let's make value-based payment infrastructure ubiquitous.
Let's incentivize communication and evidence-based approaches that improve #PatientExperience, improve #PopulationHealth, and reduce the per capita cost of health care. We know the way. We just need the will. Who's with me? #QI",Health outcomes

"On Monday, March 6, Sylvia Lopez, whoâ€™s a Care Manager at SCAN called a member Iâ€™ll call MaryAnn.
MaryAnn was a new member. She is dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and so she recently enrolled in our Connections plan.
Sylvia thought sheâ€™d be doing a quick, routine health assessment.
Well, hereâ€™s what Sylvia quickly learned:
â€¢ MaryAnn is 81 years old.
â€¢ She experiences forgetfulness and has uncontrolled pain in her ankles, knees and back. Sheâ€™s got other ailments including hypertension, and incontinence.
â€¢ She fell out of her bed recently.
â€¢ She canâ€™t really take care of herself anymore. She canâ€™t cook or clean her apartment.
â€¢ MaryAnn also lives alone. Her daughter used to care for her, but her daughter passed away from COVID.
In addition, MaryAnn was hungry.
Remember, Sylvia called her on a Monday. MaryAnn hadnâ€™t had a meal since the preceding Friday.
She was signed up with Meals on Wheels, but the portions were small and her next delivery wasnâ€™t due until the next day.
MaryAnn couldnâ€™t go to the local supermarket. A taxi would cost her $20, and she didnâ€™t have the money, since sheâ€™d used it to take a taxi to her last doctorâ€™s appointment.
She had half a jar of peanut butter in her house, and she was rationing 2 tablespoons of peanut butter every 3-4 hours. 2 tablespoons. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. Imagine that.
So hereâ€™s where Sylvia stepped in. First, she got her authorization for Chronic Condition meals so sheâ€™d have food right away.
Her independent living benefit wasnâ€™t due to kick in until April 1, but she was hungry, so the SCAN team didnâ€™t waste any time approving her for immediate food delivery.
Then, Sylvia called Meals on Wheels America to make sure the delivery would be made the next day.
She also explained to MaryAnn that as a SCAN member she had a transportation benefit, which she could use to get to the doctor and the supermarket.
And then, the next day, Sylvia called MaryAnn again. She made sure she sheâ€™d gotten her meals.
She went over how to arrange transportation.
She told her SCAN would be sending her extra meals for as long as she needed them.
In addition, she got MaryAnn incontinence supplies and a SCAN Personal Emergency Response System so she can call for help if she falls or if she needs medical help.
She also helped arrange for a caregiver to come to MaryAnnâ€™s home three times a week to assist her with personal care and homemaking.
At the end of Sylviaâ€™s and MaryAnnâ€™s call, MaryAnn told Sylvia sheâ€™d had a dream the night after they spoke. â€œIn the dream, an angel came to me,â€ MaryAnn told Sylvia. â€œAnd the angel was you.â€
We often talk about models to address the needs of complex patients.
What we donâ€™t talk about is the incredible empathy, passion, and dedication required to serve these patients day-in, day-out.
Thank you, Sylvia!",MISC

"We had a lot of good news to share during Pfizerâ€™s Q1 2023 earnings call this morning. Some highlights:
- More than 250 million patients* were treated with our medicines and vaccines this quarter.
- We have received approval for our nasal spray for migraine, a new patient population for our eczema treatment, and a new patient population for our 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
- We are working to potentially help more patients living with cancer through our planned merger with Seagen, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions.
- We continued to build trust, as evidenced by receiving two accolades this quarter from Fortune and Ethisphere respectively, both for the second year in a row! At Pfizer, trust is everything--a key driver of our ability to deliver breakthroughs that change patientsâ€™ lives.

Throughout these conversations, four major themes emerged:
1. Cross-industry collaboration is vital to moving the health care industry forward;
2. The acceleration of innovation in health care isnâ€™t slowing;
3. The industry must integrate new innovations and technologies to harness their promise for both health care companies and patients; and
4. Focusing on proactive, preventive, and accessible care is imperative.

"Why do businesses play a key role in advancing #HealthEquity? Because employers own some of the major drivers of health #disparitiesâ€”determinants such as income, economic stability, benefits (PTO, health insurance, mental health supports), and social conditions in the communities in which they operate. With this power comes a responsibility to act.
Business leaders looking for a place to start should consider this excellent piece from Harvard Business Review: https://bit.ly/3CHNvCp.
Authors Shantanu Nundy Lisa Cooper, and Ellen Kelsay outline several opportunities that companies can pursue to improve health equity among their employees and communities. Take note and take action!
â€œBy using a health equity lens and proven strategies to eliminate disparities, employers can improve business outcomes, create a better employee experience, and advance health for all.â€

"We are excited to announce our two major efforts (among many more) going into this yearâ€™s annual enrollment:
First, we are thrilled to announce a 10-year partnership with ApolloMed on a collaborative new health plan that is focused on serving minority communities through differentiated benefits. ApolloMed is one of the premier healthcare provider organizations comprised of independent and employed physiciansâ€”and will work together with us to build tailored, culturally competent benefits and services for its large population of Asian-American, Hispanic, and African-American patients. In the words of their co-CEO Brandon Sim:
â€œIn SCAN, we have found a partner who understands as much as we do that healthcare is local, and that healthcare must be tailored to diverse and traditionally underserved populations. SCANâ€™s focus on historically marginalized communities is the exact mission that ApolloMed was founded to address, and we view SCAN as a partner that can work with us to deliver exceptional healthcare to not only the communities weâ€™re based in today but also new regions as we grow together.â€
Second, we are thrilled to announce the creation of the Medicare Advantage industryâ€™s first womenâ€™s focused product. Recognizing the central role women play in shaping their familiesâ€™ healthcare decisions, we wanted to deliver a Medicare Advantage experience that offers an additional layer of support. Our â€œInspiredâ€ health plan will connect members with their own womenâ€™s health advocate, a healthcare professional who can assist members in receiving personalized care. The plan will also offer $0 estrogen therapy, access to fitness facilities and on-demand live streaming fitness; reimbursement for weight management programs; and other benefits. We are thrilled to partner with Cedars-Sinai (thank you Tom Priselac for your partnership!) and other provider partners on this new product offering that we hope will lead others to build customized experiences for women.
Huge kudos to all of the amazing members of the SCAN team who helped launch these efforts with incredible passion for our mission of keeping *ALL* seniors (regardless of their race, culture, or gender) healthy and independent.

"""The pursuit of profit with purpose requires patience,"" reminds George Serafeim in his article for Financial Times that illuminates the evolving dynamics between business aspirations and societal change.
In a world quick to mythologize the binaries of purpose and profit, George Serafeim underscores the potential harmony of the two. Drawing attention to the evolving landscape, he emphasizes that our aspirations to integrate purpose in business might challenge us, but it's an effort deeply entrenched in possibility. As he notes, ""It is a myth that the pursuit of purpose in business is futile because it is antithetical to profit.""
