"It was a pleasure to be part of Roche's LinkedIn Live Digital InnoLAB TechTalk earlier this week. I was impressed that more than 1000 people joined the event and followed the discussion on the topic of purpose-driven companies. Thank you to Stephanie Sassman and Professor George Serafeim for the great talk and for bringing unique perspectives from Women's Health as well as research to the table! Big thanks also to the organizing team, very well done!
One of the most important topics we discussed was purpose versus profit which actually is purpose AND profit. My key takeaway for Roche and our industry is that if we want to make healthcare sustainable, we need profits in order to fund R&D. Without profits, we cannot invest and ensure we are doing now what patients need next. Moreover, purpose needs to have an exciting and energizing element. I look forward to continuing the conversation!

"Take a moment to read through the findings of America's Health Rankings Annual Report, just released by the United Health Foundation this morning. It shows the prevalence of eight chronic conditions in the U.S. is higher than it's been in the report's history. Conditions like diabetes, depression and cancer that impact the lives of millions of people each day and remain a focal point for health disparities across the country. It's a sobering reminder for anyone working in health care. And it's just one of the many reasons we are working to build a health system equipped to treat the people who need us most. https://lnkd.in/gSJEgRhh",Health outcomes

"Divorce changes pretty much everything. Whether it's a surprise or something you're both on board with, you've gone from a ""we"" to a ""me"" "" and that can take some getting used to.
Maybe you were involved in the family finances while you were married, or maybe not. Either way, now the checkbook is in your hands. And that checkbook may look different than what you expected.
Why? Frustratingly, research shows that women's household income falls almost twice as much as men's post-split. And divorce can affect women's money in a lot of other ways, too.
That's a lot. And dealing with it is also pretty urgent. Financial instability is stressful and disruptive (especially if you're in a pretty emotional place right now).
That's why the Ellevest team put together a post-divorce guide at the link below. Our all-woman team of financial advisors has helped thousands of women model out the impact of a divorce settlement and what it ""means for their finances before it's too late.",MISC

To improve care for frail and vulnerable populations of all kinds.

SCAN's strength is in the Medicare program, where we have 6 years straight of 4.5 Star performance (a feat accomplished by only 2 other plans in the country).
CareOregon's strength is in the Medicaid program where it has received national accolades for its patient-centered approach to serving the physical and behavioral health needs of people that society has too often forgotten.
Together, HealthRight will exceed $6.8B in revenues and 3000 employees and serve more than 800,000 people.

"I don't believe that Elon will do well with his investment in Twitter.
But it is impossible to deny his incredible impact on the world as the driving force behind Tesla and SpaceX. And he may be just getting started. I think most of the media missed the point with last week's Starship launch by deeming it a failure, when it was really a remarkable existence proof and very promising for the future.
In essence, it demonstrated a leap frog in rocket payload and efficiency, which when perfected would enable human travel to Mars and radical transformation of cross ocean airfreight. The first 30 minutes of the last episode of the All-In Pod covered this and included a SpaceX board member. I really recommend listening - such a refreshing, optimistic lens on human ingenuity, commitment and the final frontier.

At Deloitte we believe that our businesses and teams work #bettertogether and as an industry it is clear when we work cross industry, discipline and background, we will certainly be better. And that gives me hope for a better tomorrow.

"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. President Truman""the first presidential champion of Medicare""was in attendance to witness. The program was seen at the time as a major anti-poverty program for older adults. I sometimes think about what President Truman and Johnson would think of the program that they created. This morning, Don Berwick moderated a dialog between me and Rick Gilfillan about the future of the Medicare Advantage program for the IHI Leadership Alliance. I was grateful for a respectful dialog with two mentors I admire and used the opportunity to articulate some changes that I believe will make Medicare Advantage a better program for older adults:
1) Standardized, regulated benefits - plans should compete on quality of administration, not on gimmicky benefits with low utilization rates.
2) Longer enrollment periods - annual enrollment disables a true focus on investing in chronic disease prevention and management
3) Reform of STAR rating program - high star ratings translate into higher payments to plans and higher benefits. Plans have built in disincentives to serve more complex patients and populations because higher star ratings are harder to achieve with more complex populations. 4) New methods for risk adjustment that are aligned with 2023 technologies - CMS should test machine learning models of risk adjustment that iteratively reward plans for true risk rather than expected risk. 5) More clearly articulated clinical requirements - CMS should articulate stronger clincial guidelines around accesss to care to ensure that no corners are caught in the care of patients.
Critics of Medicare Advantare would have us throw the baby out with bath water. It's a complicated program with good actors and bad actors""and unintended consequences. Like every single other health policy. That said, it provides an incredible amount of security to older adults who are on a fixed income""hence its popularity. Traditional Medicare pushes a sizable cost share on to older adults (whose average pretax income is $48,000) who are often unable to bear the expense of copays (20% of most office visits and $1600 for any hospitalization). Traditional Medicare requires literal acts of Congress (Congress!) to introduce new benefits. There was no prescription drug coverage until 2004 (2004!). There is still no vision, dental, or hearing coverage in traditional Medicare. ACOs may lower total costs of care but they do little to lower costs for beneficiary-save reducing their utilization of services some. President Truman and President Johnson wanted a Medicare program that gave older adults financial security and health coverage in their Golden years. Let's keep working to build a better Medicare program and give them that.",Health Insurance

"Ever wonder what happens when you order a Lyft at the airport? Thanksgiving weekend is one of our busiest, so I strapped on my seatbelt and want to SFO. Here's what happens.
SFO has two waiting lots, each about a mile away from the terminal. Each typically has 50 or so drivers waiting. Pictured below are two: Abdul, a long-time Lyft driver originally from Afghanistan, and Adele, three months in-- and very excited about our new Women+Connect feature that lets her pick up more women riders!

"One of my favorite things about private equity is the opportunity to bring great teams of innovators together to create great companies. When we combined complementary financial technology leaders AxiomSL and Calypso two years ago to create Adenza with Didier B. at the helm, we knew we were building something really special. Independently, each company had a best-of-breed product in a large and growing market; together, the company was among the best software franchises we've had the privilege of owning. We brought Thoma Bravo's operational and software expertise to bear to accelerate growth, improve operations and provide customers with a comprehensive platform to help navigate their highly complicated digital transformations alongside an ever-evolving regulatory landscape.
Today, Nasdaq announced a definitive agreement to acquire Adenza. We have long-admired Nasdaq and the transformation they've undergone under Adena Friedman's leadership "" from organic initiatives to a number of acquisitions, Nasdaq has cemented its position as one of the most important and trusted financial technology providers in the world. The addition of Adenza's platform will deepen Nasdaq's global suite of mission-critical financial technology solutions, enhancing its ability to solve the most complex challenges financial institutions face across risk, regulation and capital markets. This acquisition accelerates Nasdaq's vision to become the trusted fabric of the financial system, delivering platforms to improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy.
Since 1971, when Nasdaq created the world's first electronic exchange, their innovations have revolutionized the global capital markets and overall financial system, making them the perfect partner for Adenza in this next phase of their journey. And I'm excited that we get to continue to be a part of it; at the close of the transaction, Thoma Bravo will become a shareholder in Nasdaq and I expect to join the company's Board of Directors.
This transaction is an endorsement of what we have built together in a relatively short period of time and a testament to the dedication of the Adenza team. Huge thanks to Didier Bouillard and his team, J. Charles Goodman, Erik Akopiantz, Kristin Nimsger Weston, Brian Jaffee, Jamie Hutter and the rest of the Thoma Bravo team for making this possible. I look forward to continued partnership with Adenza and leveraging our 20+ years of software and technology experience to support the Nasdaq team to drive further innovation and digital transformation across the global financial system.

This new Executive Order's focus on the federal government's use and procurement of AI systems is critical, as its massive purchasing power can set the bar for adopting trustworthy AI. We're pleased that this Executive Order creates new opportunities for innovation and research, regarding the safety and risk-management of AI foundation models. But we also believe the best way to address potential AI safety concerns is through open innovation. A robust open-source ecosystem with a diversity of voices - including creators, developers, and academics - will help rapidly advance the science of AI safety and foster competition in the marketplace. For over a century, IBM has been at the forefront of introducing powerful technologies while prioritizing safety and security. Through our commitment to responsible AI, IBM is uniquely positioned to help government agencies adopt AI in ways that are responsible, trusted and a real benefit for the American people.
Today's order is just the beginning as we ensure the responsible use of #AI across the federal government. IBM welcomes Congress' focus on AI as well, and we are pleased to participate in forums like the recent AI Insight Forum hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, as we advocate for a risk-based approach to AI regulation that will provide firm guardrails for protecting society while ensuring America continues as the world leader in AI innovation and open-source development.",MISC
"I worry that approaches like this (billing for some electronic health communications) de-incentivize clinician-patient interaction, especially when the cost is put on the #patient instead of being borne by our payers.
But more than that, I worry that we're getting caught up in the weeds while the biggest question remains...
When are we going to say enough already with this ridiculous transactional system of #FeeForService medicine?
The medical emails that this article talks about account for 1-1.5% of all clinician-patient ""email"" threads. The revenue generated is a drop in the bucket. And alleviated 1% of our inboxes as docs isn't going to solve the burnout or turnover problems we face.
But, what happens when patients with complex needs stop messaging their clinicians because they're afraid of incurring a bill?
They don't get the information they need to manage their care, their condition worsens, and they wind up in the #ER "" the most expensive setting in a health system. No one wins.
But, a #HealthSystem that's built on relationships and is managing costs on a capitated basis can promote engagement and dialogue with patients. Because studies have shown time and again that consistent, effective patient-clinician communication is associated with better health outcomes and often lower costs.
A health system in a value-based environment is incentivized to staff an inbox or implement a virtual hotline, because they know that consistent communication is linked to better outcomes and that's the basis on which the institution is paid/rewarded. Frankly such a system just allows doctors and nurses to spend the time needed with their patients to build relationships and mitigate high cost health risks.
On the other hand, poor communication and lack of interaction between patients and clinicians are known contributors to #disparities and deepen distrust in health care. And that's exactly what we're going to do with these absurd charges for emails. We're going to make it harder for patients to communicate with their clinicians and it's going to lead to less access and less needed care. We cannot allow this to happen. Trust is an essential element in advancing #HealthEquity.
So, let's put an end to the madness.
Let's make value-based payment infrastructure ubiquitous.
Let's incentivize communication and evidence-based approaches that improve #PatientExperience, improve #PopulationHealth, and reduce the per capita cost of health care. We know the way. We just need the will. Who's with me? #QI",Health outcomes

"On Monday, March 6, Sylvia Lopez, who's a Care Manager at SCAN called a member I'll call MaryAnn.
MaryAnn was a new member. She is dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and so she recently enrolled in our Connections plan.
Sylvia thought she'd be doing a quick, routine health assessment.
Well, here's what Sylvia quickly learned:
"" MaryAnn is 81 years old.
"" She experiences forgetfulness and has uncontrolled pain in her ankles, knees and back. She's got other ailments including hypertension, and incontinence.
"" She fell out of her bed recently.
"" She can't really take care of herself anymore. She can't cook or clean her apartment.
"" MaryAnn also lives alone. Her daughter used to care for her, but her daughter passed away from COVID.
In addition, MaryAnn was hungry.
Remember, Sylvia called her on a Monday. MaryAnn hadn't had a meal since the preceding Friday.
She was signed up with Meals on Wheels, but the portions were small and her next delivery wasn't due until the next day.
MaryAnn couldn't go to the local supermarket. A taxi would cost her $20, and she didn't have the money, since she'd used it to take a taxi to her last doctor's appointment.
She had half a jar of peanut butter in her house, and she was rationing 2 tablespoons of peanut butter every 3-4 hours. 2 tablespoons. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. Imagine that.
So here's where Sylvia stepped in. First, she got her authorization for Chronic Condition meals so she'd have food right away.
Her independent living benefit wasn't due to kick in until April 1, but she was hungry, so the SCAN team didn't waste any time approving her for immediate food delivery.
Then, Sylvia called Meals on Wheels America to make sure the delivery would be made the next day.
She also explained to MaryAnn that as a SCAN member she had a transportation benefit, which she could use to get to the doctor and the supermarket.
And then, the next day, Sylvia called MaryAnn again. She made sure she she'd gotten her meals.
She went over how to arrange transportation.
She told her SCAN would be sending her extra meals for as long as she needed them.
In addition, she got MaryAnn incontinence supplies and a SCAN Personal Emergency Response System so she can call for help if she falls or if she needs medical help.
She also helped arrange for a caregiver to come to MaryAnn's home three times a week to assist her with personal care and homemaking.
At the end of Sylvia's and MaryAnn's call, MaryAnn told Sylvia she'd had a dream the night after they spoke. ""In the dream, an angel came to me,"" MaryAnn told Sylvia. ""And the angel was you.""
We often talk about models to address the needs of complex patients.

1) The path to widespread AI adoption in enterprises will likely take 2 to 5 years. Currently, there is a lot of enterprise experimentation with applications where hallucinations remain an issue. Additionally, there are challenges with scaling infrastructure to meet large-scale adoption. 2) We are still in the early days of figuring out what we can do with this technology similar to the early days of the Apple app store where the current set of GenAI applications are not necessarily revolutionary. The more interesting use cases are still to come. As a result, emerging players will have to help enterprises learn where and how to adopt these new applications, plus define their outcomes and return on investment. 3) For company builders, governance and safety need to be a bottom-up priority where you are able to respond to the evolving regulatory landscape.

We've been living and working in new ways for over three years, and we know people, devices, workloads, and applications will continue to be more and more distributed moving forward. Organizations are accelerating their multi-cloud adoption more quickly than many expected. In this dynamic environment, a number of my peers have expressed that they don't worry about if a breach will happen, but when.
But despite so much uncertainty, I remain optimistic. I believe the data highlights the opportunities that exist for the public and private sectors to work together to close the readiness gap. With tighter alignment and partnership, we can truly reap all the benefits of our connected world, without fear of disruption. We all depend on a secure world, and if we share threat intelligence, cooperate on legislation to keep everyone safe, and rally around the idea that security and privacy are human rights, we can realize a truly secure and inclusive future for all.

Use a privacy screen filter: A privacy screen filter is a thin, plastic film that you can place over your laptop or mobile device screen. It obscures the view of your screen from anyone who is not directly in front of it, making it difficult for people sitting next to you or behind you to see what you're doing.
Adjust your screen brightness: By turning down the brightness of your screen, you can make it more difficult for others to see what's on your screen. This is especially useful if you're working on sensitive or confidential information.

"#ArtificialIntelligence has the potential to transform the health sector. Clinical trials; medical diagnosis, treatment, self-care and person-centred care; and supplementing health care professionals' knowledge, skills and competencies - these are all areas that hashtag#AI could enhance. Here is one example: AI could be beneficial in settings where there is a lack of medical specialists, e.g. in interpreting retinal scans and radiology images, among many others.
However, AI technologies are being rapidly deployed, sometimes without a full understanding of how they may perform, which could either benefit or harm end-users, including health-care professionals and patients. Recognising the potential and risks of AI, the World Health Organization published regulatory considerations on AI for health, covering the following aspects:
1) the importance of transparency and documentation
2) risk management, including cybersecurity threats
3) intended use and analytical and clinical validation
4) data quality
5) privacy and data protection
6) collaboration between stakeholders to ensure products and services stay compliant with regulation throughout their lifecycles
