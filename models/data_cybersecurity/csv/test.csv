"Last week we were privileged to host a dinner featuring a select group of startup leaders operating at the cutting edge of GenAI. While the conversation was lively and wide-ranging, we honed in on what some of the core implications for modern enterprises would be. Here were 3 key takeaways:
1) The path to widespread AI adoption in enterprises will likely take 2 to 5 years. Currently, there is a lot of enterprise experimentation with applications where hallucinations remain an issue. Additionally, there are challenges with scaling infrastructure to meet large-scale adoption. 2) We are still in the early days of figuring out what we can do with this technology similar to the early days of the Apple app store where the current set of GenAI applications are not necessarily revolutionary. The more interesting use cases are still to come. As a result, emerging players will have to help enterprises learn where and how to adopt these new applications, plus define their outcomes and return on investment. 3) For company builders, governance and safety need to be a bottom-up priority where you are able to respond to the evolving regulatory landscape. However, determining the appropriate regulations for GenAI is difficult because predicting the societal risks at the burgeoning stages of AI is akin to predicting the risks of social media at its onset in the early 2010s.",Data privacy and cybersecurity

"Today, IBM is proud to join President Biden and a broad group of stakeholders at the White House to acknowledge the tremendous opportunity of AI and our shared commitment to harness it responsibly. This new Executive Order's focus on the federal government's use and procurement of AI systems is critical, as its massive purchasing power can set the bar for adopting trustworthy AI. We're pleased that this Executive Order creates new opportunities for innovation and research, regarding the safety and risk-management of AI foundation models. But we also believe the best way to address potential AI safety concerns is through open innovation. A robust open-source ecosystem with a diversity of voices - including creators, developers, and academics - will help rapidly advance the science of AI safety and foster competition in the marketplace. For over a century, IBM has been at the forefront of introducing powerful technologies while prioritizing safety and security. Through our commitment to responsible AI, IBM is uniquely positioned to help government agencies adopt AI in ways that are responsible, trusted and a real benefit for the American people.
Today's order is just the beginning as we ensure the responsible use of #AI across the federal government. IBM welcomes Congress' focus on AI as well, and we are pleased to participate in forums like the recent AI Insight Forum hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, as we advocate for a risk-based approach to AI regulation that will provide firm guardrails for protecting society while ensuring America continues as the world leader in AI innovation and open-source development.",MISC

"Divorce changes pretty much everything. Whether it's a surprise or something you're both on board with, you've gone from a ""we"" to a ""me"" "" and that can take some getting used to.
Maybe you were involved in the family finances while you were married, or maybe not. Either way, now the checkbook is in your hands. And that checkbook may look different than what you expected.
Why? Frustratingly, research shows that women's household income falls almost twice as much as men's post-split. And divorce can affect women's money in a lot of other ways, too.
That's a lot. And dealing with it is also pretty urgent. Financial instability is stressful and disruptive (especially if you're in a pretty emotional place right now).

"I don't believe that Elon will do well with his investment in Twitter.
But it is impossible to deny his incredible impact on the world as the driving force behind Tesla and SpaceX. And he may be just getting started.

In essence, it demonstrated a leap frog in rocket payload and efficiency, which when perfected would enable human travel to Mars and radical transformation of cross ocean airfreight. The first 30 minutes of the last episode of the All-In Pod covered this and included a SpaceX board member.
