Community engagement and safety are paramount to us at Plus Power, and we were grateful for the participation of many state and local officials and community stakeholders to help us celebrate.This 185 MW / 565 MWh facility, relying on 158 Tesla Megapack 2's, is the largest demonstration in the world of grid-forming services from a standalone battery storage facility. It is committed to provide 50 MW of Fast Frequency Response, virtual inertia, and blackstart services akin to a conventional power plant""but in 250 milliseconds and without emissions or need of water. We are thrilled to work with  Hawaiian Electric on this landmark facility that will help hashtag#Hawaii meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045.  This groundbreaking project is a postcard from the future: Batteries will soon be providing these services, at scale, on the mainland.

"The world has seen an extraordinary transformation in healthcare delivery, courtesy of the global pandemic. At Elevance Health, we are at the forefront of this change - witnessing a 3% YoY increase in virtual visits, topping 800k in 2023 alone!

Our recent study aimed to gauge consumers' perspectives on virtual healthcare. The results? A whopping 75% of consumers endorse virtual care, planning to continue and recommend these services. They appreciate the accessibility, earning an impressive 90% agreement that virtual care caters to those unable to physically visit a doctor, and 81% acknowledging the improvement in healthcare via integration of virtual care.

Inspired by these insightful findings, Elevance Health keeps evolving with a patient-centric approach, integrating care data, and optimizing virtual health interactions. With rising optimism and growing adoption rates, it's clear that we're only at the initial stage of a virtual care revolution.

"The first Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute Center for Injury Research and Prevention celebrated Tuesday evening with its original founders, Drs. Flaura Winston and Dennis Durbin in attendance alongside CHOP leaders, investigators, collaborators, students, staff, and more.

In 1996, Drs. Winston and Durbin dreamed of raising the rigor of injury research as it applied to children. They brought together a team of scientists and clinicians who began building an evidence base to educate families, inform policies and regulations, influence laws, and make the world safer for children and adolescents.

Today, CIRP is an ambitious and multidisciplinary center with a broad range of focus areas from young driver safety to violence prevention to concussion and brain health, and so much more. Learn more about the future of CIRP at CHOP: http://ms.spr.ly/6041YktEv

"It was great to see the progress made on Newell Brands' packaging sustainability goals we communicated over the last few years. Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have. Great job Adam Brandimore, Lauren Jones, Frances Mazur-Batistoni and others for the work over the years developing and driving the packaging sustainability goals.",Research and Development
