"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams. Our collaboration with Houston Methodist is one of the largest deployments of generative AI within healthcare today. Please join us: I'm eager to share our experience "" and to hear what you're working on in this industry sea change.",Research and Development
"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

It was a day of empowerment and heartfelt connections! 
I'm looking forward to what Day 3 has in store.

"It was great to see the progress made on Newell Brands' packaging sustainability goals we communicated over the last few years. Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

"Had the amazing opportunity to present my Barrett Honors Thesis to the world on Friday! Throughout the year we took just an idea, Is it possible to use puzzles to accurately test a certain congative function while still being profitable and fun. Throughout the year we did market research and collected data from our family and peers and ultimately was able to pitch the idea of a company called Intellectra.The premise was an interesting one. A customer would order a puzzle off of the internet and have it directly delivered to their house. They would then go to the website and read instructions on how the puzzle operates and how scoring could work. The user would do the puzzle and enter their scores on the free calculator on the website and it would compare the scores to our large database and not only give them a score but also an explanation on how they did on that cognitive function.Overall this project was super fun to work on over the year. Not only did I get to apply my electrical and coding skills from my engineering program but I got to learn buisness skills. We got to learn first hand how it feels to be entrepreneurs.

This years report is characterized largely by an optimistic attitude on the part of #SmallBiz owners, despite uncertainty around broader macroeconomic factors. While some obstacles remain, overall, business owners are planning for a prosperous future. We found that:
 
 Nearly two-thirds of small business owners expect their business revenue to increase in the year ahead. 

 Worries about inflation and interest rates have lessened since last Spring, while recession and supply chain concerns are down significantly. Costs of healthcare and commodity prices are still high on the list of small business owner worries. 

 Many owners are taking proactive steps to ensure the health and success of their businesses. Nearly 40% plan to expand this year, and over 70% plan to seek financing, building on strong revenues that were generally higher in 2023 than in 2022.

These include:

* From experimentation to work flow integration:  I've been asking a question at every session I've been doing over the past few years about the audience's current from use on scale from not using, experimented once, use it for a few tasks, integrated into workflow.  The percentages keep moving towards ""integrated into workflow,"" but the entry point is for task.   Experimenting opens up the opportunity to rethink your workflow so it more productive.

* Not Comfortable Yet:  A net promoter score of -28 for comfort. No surprise. The challenge of transfer for any new skill or adoption of a tool is real.  We've seen this before with other emerging tech in the sector.  When a new tech comes along that causes a disruption or change in the way we work, making that change is always slower than we think.  I think about the quote from Deborah Schultz, ""Technology changes, humans don't."" that Gapingvoid Culture Design Group immortalized as a cartoon.

* Team Silos and Loners:  Not surprising to find that AI in nonprofit has not yet achieved enterprise level adoption.   It is either single staff (probably using it without a policy or permission) or team level collaboration. The latter is actually a great change management strategy - to have one team be the early adopters - experiment and share - all with along developing the ethical data guidelines and organizational strategy.  Change management work is slow even the tech is moving so fast. 

Some of the comments and advice from participants included advice that is now outdated. You wont be replaced by AI. Youll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI. Ethan Mollick recently shared why: 1) Your job is more likely to transform over time than be taken
2) Some jobs will really disappear with AI
3) Using AI is going to get easier, it is isnt a secret priesthood
4) Organizations ultimately need to integrate AI into their structures, it isnt all about what individual workers do

There was another comment from one respondent:  Id love to invest in a LLM specifically for the social sector that reflects our values.  While this may not be feasible at this time given that organizational adoption has not moved from silos and loners, but could it be a North Star?  Of course, there are other reasons why this might not be feasible (costs, agreeing on standards, field biased foundational models, etc)

"Today marks a career highlight for me. 

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what theyre seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. Im honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsofts LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a whole-slide foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by looking at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and were making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool thatll help that human with a microscope see things they didnt realize were there.

"Fewer than 25% of sales organizations have a forecast accuracy of 75% or greater according to Korn Ferry.

As an example, Salesforce missed its revenue forecast for the first time in 20 years two weeks ago, causing a 20% drop in stock ($40+ billion in market cap - since then recovered to -12.77%).

The ripple effects can be huge:
-  Stressful board meetings
-  Drop in equity value
-  Re-forecast
-  Sales capacity wrong
-  Re-structuring

No question - accurate forecasting is hard.

As a SaaS scale-up, you don't need to forecast +/-2% before the quarter starts like Salesforce.
