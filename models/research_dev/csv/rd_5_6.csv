https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,"Fewer than 25% of sales organizations have a forecast accuracy of 75% or greater according to Korn Ferry.

As an example, Salesforce missed its revenue forecast for the first time in 20 years two weeks ago, causing a 20% drop in stock ($40+ billion in market cap - since then recovered to -12.77%).

The ripple effects can be huge:
-  Stressful board meetings
-  Drop in equity value
-  Re-forecast
-  Sales capacity wrong
-  Re-structuring

No question - accurate forecasting is hard.

As a SaaS scale-up, you don't need to forecast +/-2% before the quarter starts like Salesforce.

Actually, you shouldn't - way too much time would be lost trying to perfect the forecast process.

BUT, you should aim get to > 90% by week 4.

Forecasting isn't about the final number - it's a process that should help you beat the outcome in a predictable way.

Here are 3 simply tips to improve your forecasting process:

1.  Run a forecast process
-  Most SaaS companies run a weekly rhythm
-  Clean pipeline data is paramount
-  1-1s, pipeline reviews, and forecasting meetings
-  Track weekly changes

2.  Forecast new logo + expansions + renewals separately
-  Forecast your pipeline for new logo, expansions and renewals
-  Adjust stages, and forecast categories to mirror you new logo, expansion, and -  renewal process

3.  Combine forecasts
-  Weighted, bottom-up, Ops or/and AI prediction to have different input factors
-  Tweak the weighted and ops model to increase accuracy
-  Track forecast accuracy of bottom up forecast
