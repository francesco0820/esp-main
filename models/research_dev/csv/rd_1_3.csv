"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.Â For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,Â that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, Iâ€™ll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams. Our collaboration with Houston Methodist is one of the largest deployments of generative AI within healthcare today. Please join us: Iâ€™m eager to share our experience â€“ and to hear what youâ€™re working on in this industry sea change.","Product Development,Research & Development,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics,Customer centricity",checked
"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 🌈✨

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

🔷 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

🔷 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

🔷 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

🔷 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

🔷 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

It was a day of empowerment and heartfelt connections! 
I'm looking forward to what Day 3 has in store.

"The world has seen an extraordinary transformation in healthcare delivery, courtesy of the global pandemic. At Elevance Health, we are at the forefront of this change - witnessing a 3% YoY increase in virtual visits, topping 800k in 2023 alone!

Our recent study aimed to gauge consumers' perspectives on virtual healthcare. The results? A whopping 75% of consumers endorse virtual care, planning to continue and recommend these services. They appreciate the accessibility, earning an impressive 90% agreement that virtual care caters to those unable to physically visit a doctor, and 81% acknowledging the improvement in healthcare via integration of virtual care.

Inspired by these insightful findings, Elevance Health keeps evolving with a patient-centric approach, integrating care data, and optimizing virtual health interactions. With rising optimism and growing adoption rates, it's clear that we're only at the initial stage of a virtual care revolution.
