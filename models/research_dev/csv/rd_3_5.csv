Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

Throughout the year we took just an idea, Is it possible to use puzzles to accurately test a certain congative function while still being profitable and fun. Throughout the year we did market research and collected data from our family and peers and ultimately was able to pitch the idea of a company called Intellectra.The premise was an interesting one. A customer would order a puzzle off of the internet and have it directly delivered to their house. They would then go to the website and read instructions on how the puzzle operates and how scoring could work. The user would do the puzzle and enter their scores on the free calculator on the website and it would compare the scores to our large database and not only give them a score but also an explanation on how they did on that cognitive function.Overall this project was super fun to work on over the year. Not only did I get to apply my electrical and coding skills from my engineering program but I got to learn buisness skills. We got to learn first hand how it feels to be entrepreneurs. I also got to learn a lot about the puzzle market which was very interesting coming from my escape room background.

Raul A. Anaya and I are proud to share that Bank of America’s 2024 Business Owner Report is live. We surveyed small and mid-sized business owners from across the country to understand their views, aspirations, and concerns. It’s packed full of entrepreneurial and economic insights.
 
This year’s report is characterized largely by an optimistic attitude on the part of #SmallBiz owners, despite uncertainty around broader macroeconomic factors. While some obstacles remain, overall, business owners are planning for a prosperous future. We found that:
 
💰 Nearly two-thirds of small business owners expect their business revenue to increase in the year ahead. 

📈 Worries about inflation and interest rates have lessened since last Spring, while recession and supply chain concerns are down significantly. Costs of healthcare and commodity prices are still high on the list of small business owner worries. 

✅ Many owners are taking proactive steps to ensure the health and success of their businesses. Nearly 40% plan to expand this year, and over 70% plan to seek financing, building on strong revenues that were generally higher in 2023 than in 2022.

These include:

* From experimentation to work flow integration:  I've been asking a question at every session I've been doing over the past few years about the audience's current from use on scale from not using, experimented once, use it for a few tasks, integrated into workflow.  The percentages keep moving towards ""integrated into workflow,"" but the entry point is for task.   Experimenting opens up the opportunity to rethink your workflow so it more productive.

* Not Comfortable Yet:  A net promoter score of -28 for comfort. No surprise. The challenge of transfer for any new skill or adoption of a tool is real.  We've seen this before with other emerging tech in the sector.  When a new tech comes along that causes a disruption or change in the way we work, making that change is always slower than we think.  I think about the quote from Deborah Schultz, ""Technology changes, humans don't."" that Gapingvoid Culture Design Group immortalized as a cartoon.

* Team Silos and Loners:  Not surprising to find that AI in nonprofit has not yet achieved enterprise level adoption.   It is either single staff (probably using it without a policy or permission) or team level collaboration. The latter is actually a great change management strategy - to have one team be the early adopters - experiment and share - all with along developing the ethical data guidelines and organizational strategy.  Change management work is slow even the tech is moving so fast. 

Some of the comments and advice from participants included advice that is now outdated. “You won’t be replaced by AI. You’ll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI.” Ethan Mollick recently shared why: 1) “Your job”’ is more likely to transform over time than be “taken”
2) Some jobs will really disappear with AI
3) Using AI is going to get easier, it is isn’t a secret priesthood
4) Organizations ultimately need to integrate AI into their structures, it isn’t all about what individual workers do

https://lnkd.in/gMpuJvqu

There was another comment from one respondent:  “I’d love to invest in a LLM specifically for the social sector that reflects our values.”  While this may not be feasible at this time given that organizational adoption has not moved from silos and loners, but could it be a North Star?  Of course, there are other reasons why this might not be feasible (costs, agreeing on standards, field biased foundational models, etc)

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what they’re seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. I’m honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsoft’s LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a ‘whole-slide’ foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by ‘looking’ at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and we’re making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool that’ll help that human with a microscope ‘see’ things they didn’t realize were there.

I’m hugely proud of this work and grateful for the opportunity to support it.
