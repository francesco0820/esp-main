"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams.

"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

"It was great to see the progress made on Newell Brands' packaging sustainability goals we communicated over the last few years. Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

A customer would order a puzzle off of the internet and have it directly delivered to their house. They would then go to the website and read instructions on how the puzzle operates and how scoring could work. The user would do the puzzle and enter their scores on the free calculator on the website and it would compare the scores to our large database and not only give them a score but also an explanation on how they did on that cognitive function.Overall this project was super fun to work on over the year.

These include:

* From experimentation to work flow integration:  I've been asking a question at every session I've been doing over the past few years about the audience's current from use on scale from not using, experimented once, use it for a few tasks, integrated into workflow.  The percentages keep moving towards ""integrated into workflow,"" but the entry point is for task.   Experimenting opens up the opportunity to rethink your workflow so it more productive.

* Not Comfortable Yet:  A net promoter score of -28 for comfort. No surprise. The challenge of transfer for any new skill or adoption of a tool is real.  We've seen this before with other emerging tech in the sector.  When a new tech comes along that causes a disruption or change in the way we work, making that change is always slower than we think.  I think about the quote from Deborah Schultz, ""Technology changes, humans don't."" that Gapingvoid Culture Design Group immortalized as a cartoon.

* Team Silos and Loners:  Not surprising to find that AI in nonprofit has not yet achieved enterprise level adoption.   It is either single staff (probably using it without a policy or permission) or team level collaboration. The latter is actually a great change management strategy - to have one team be the early adopters - experiment and share - all with along developing the ethical data guidelines and organizational strategy.  Change management work is slow even the tech is moving so fast. 

Some of the comments and advice from participants included advice that is now outdated. You wont be replaced by AI. Youll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI. Ethan Mollick recently shared why: 1) Your job is more likely to transform over time than be taken
2) Some jobs will really disappear with AI
3) Using AI is going to get easier, it is isnt a secret priesthood
4) Organizations ultimately need to integrate AI into their structures, it isnt all about what individual workers do

There was another comment from one respondent:  Id love to invest in a LLM specifically for the social sector that reflects our values.  While this may not be feasible at this time given that organizational adoption has not moved from silos and loners, but could it be a North Star?  Of course, there are other reasons why this might not be feasible (costs, agreeing on standards, field biased foundational models, etc)

"Today marks a career highlight for me. 

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what theyre seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. Im honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsofts LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a whole-slide foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by looking at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and were making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool thatll help that human with a microscope see things they didnt realize were there.

Im hugely proud of this work and grateful for the opportunity to support it.

"Fewer than 25% of sales organizations have a forecast accuracy of 75% or greater according to Korn Ferry.

As an example, Salesforce missed its revenue forecast for the first time in 20 years two weeks ago, causing a 20% drop in stock ($40+ billion in market cap - since then recovered to -12.77%).

The ripple effects can be huge:
-  Stressful board meetings
-  Drop in equity value
-  Re-forecast
-  Sales capacity wrong
-  Re-structuring

No question - accurate forecasting is hard.

As a SaaS scale-up, you don't need to forecast +/-2% before the quarter starts like Salesforce.

Actually, you shouldn't - way too much time would be lost trying to perfect the forecast process.

BUT, you should aim get to > 90% by week 4.

Forecasting isn't about the final number - it's a process that should help you beat the outcome in a predictable way.

Here are 3 simply tips to improve your forecasting process:

1.  Run a forecast process
-  Most SaaS companies run a weekly rhythm
-  Clean pipeline data is paramount
-  1-1s, pipeline reviews, and forecasting meetings
-  Track weekly changes

2.  Forecast new logo + expansions + renewals separately
-  Forecast your pipeline for new logo, expansions and renewals
-  Adjust stages, and forecast categories to mirror you new logo, expansion, and -  renewal process

3.  Combine forecasts
-  Weighted, bottom-up, Ops or/and AI prediction to have different input factors
-  Tweak the weighted and ops model to increase accuracy
-  Track forecast accuracy of bottom up forecast
