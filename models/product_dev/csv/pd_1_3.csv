"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.Â For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,Â that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, Iâ€™ll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams. Our collaboration with Houston Methodist is one of the largest deployments of generative AI within healthcare today.

"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype.

"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

Inspired by 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,' Grok promises a unique and witty experience for its users.In a recent announcement, Musk highlighted the significance of AI and its potential impact on humanity. Despite his concerns about AI being one of the biggest threats to humanity, he believes in harnessing its power for good. Grok is a step in that direction, offering a playful and informative chatbot experience.Key highlights of Grok include:ðŸŒŸ Playful Wit: Grok is designed to answer questions with a touch of humor and a rebellious streak, making interactions more engaging.ðŸŒŸ Access to X Posts: Grok has access to user posts on the X platform, providing tailored and relevant responses to its users.ðŸŒŸ Early Testing: While Grok is currently in early testing and not available to the general public, it will eventually be released to subscribers of X's top-tier subscription service, Premium+.To give you a taste of Grok's personality, Musk shared an example of a user query, where Grok humorously responded to a request for a ""step-by-step"" guide to making cocaine, ending with a responsible message against illegal activities.Grok's development is spearheaded by Musk's new AI company, xAI. It's powered by Grok-1, a large language model that surpasses GPT-3.5 in certain benchmarks. However, it's important to note that Grok-1 lags behind the most powerful hashtag#chatgpt model, hashtag#gpt4.According to the xAI team, Grok is currently available as a prototype for a limited number of users in the US, with plans for new capabilities and features in the pipeline.Grok embodies the idea of understanding thoroughly and intuitively, making it an exciting addition to the world of AI. Stay tuned for updates as Grok continues to evolve and provide innovative solutions to your questions.hashtag#artificialintelligence hashtag#technology hashtag#generatieveai hashtag#Innovation","Product Development,AI/Machine Learning",

"Today weâ€™re announcing two new milestones in our generative AI research: Emu Video & Emu Edit. These two new models build upon our previous work in both images and videos to deliver impressive new results in high quality, diffusion-based text-to-video generation and controlled image editing using just text instructions.More details âž¡ï¸ https://bit.ly/46hkj15Emu Video paper âž¡ï¸ https://bit.ly/3sBio9IEmu Edit paper âž¡ï¸ https://bit.ly/3QBj2vY1ï¸âƒ£ Emu VideoThis new text-to-video model leverages our Emu image generation model and can respond to text-only, image-only or combined text & image inputs to generate high quality video. It uses a factorized approach that not only allows us to train video generation models more efficiently but also produces higher quality video generations.The outputs of this model were preferred by 96% of respondents over our previous model based on output quality in human evaluations.2ï¸âƒ£ Emu EditThis new model is capable of free-form editing through text instructions. Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs â€” the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"Earlier this year, some AWS developers created an internal tool for Amazonians to experiment with Foundation Models from Amazon Bedrock, and it quickly became a word-of-mouth hit across AWS.Because the interface only required a user to add in a description of the app they wanted to build in a prompt box, the tool could be used by teammates across a wide spectrum of roles and technical expertise.Some built apps for productivity, while others made ones for amusement, or that tapped into personal passions. It was cool to see builders get inspired by using generative AI in a more hands on way, and by sharing their apps with each other, they were actually sharing key generative AI techniques in action.Based on the popularity and feedback, we launched this simple to use but powerful app to the world for free, naming it PartyRock (in reference to it being a fun and collaborativeÂ way to experience Amazon Bedrock). It is built on the belief that everyone should have access to a fun and easy tool to help get started with generative AI.Since launching it last week, tens of thousands of apps have been built and shared, and the creativity has been really cool to see (including apps to organize your re:Invent schedule, plan a Formula 1 trip, and find the best coffee in Vegas).

At UHC, we've seen that almost 10% of our members who are looking at benefits in our app end up searching for mental health services. Jen Mahoney, Sandra Long and team are doing their best to provide our members with the help they need. At the end of last year, this team launched some very significant features for millions of members, such as:

Care Explorer - Helping members find the right wellness journey for their mental health. Members complete a survey to get personalized recommendations for care and providers. This helps members to start finding care for themselves and their dependents. 

Child and Family Coaching – Mental health matters for everyone, not just adults: it affects entire families. We think we can make a significant difference in the US by providing more mental health services for the whole family.

More availability, and simpler – more convenient access to behavioral health support – including quicker appointments and tailored therapy.

I am so proud of being able to work alongside brilliant and compassionate people like Sandra Long and Jen Mahoney (and the dozens of others who helped bring this to reality) - who are making it matter every day for millions of consumers!

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"6 months ago, I shared my new role as the President and Co-Founder of Vale Health. Today, a lot of work from countless people allowed us to announce the first health system going live with their wellness marketplace. https://lnkd.in/gNEVh7yE 

As you will see, we started with better sleep as a health goal. We believe we are the first to really combine evidence-based wellness products, apps, and education with direct links to the clinical services of high quality health care providers into one experience. Now, people can have a trusted wellness marketplace linked to their trusted provider for their total health and wellness needs. 

Many more person-centered goals and categories are coming soon. You will also see the launch of the other founding health systems this year. 

These are still early days, and we know there is a lot to learn still, but I do want to pause today and thank the many people and organizations that came together to get us to the first milestone.

"How do companies ship code to production? ..--Subscribe to our weekly newsletter to get a Free System Design PDF (158 pages): https://lnkd.in/g9wAgcke-- The diagram below illustrates the typical workflow.  Step 1: The process starts with a product owner creating user stories based on requirements.  Step 2: The dev team picks up the user stories from the backlog and puts them into a sprint for a two-week dev cycle.  Step 3: The developers commit source code into the code repository Git.  Step 4: A build is triggered in Jenkins. The source code must pass unit tests, code coverage threshold, and gates in SonarQube.  Step 5: Once the build is successful, the build is stored in artifactory. Then the build is deployed into the dev environment.  Step 6: There might be multiple dev teams working on different features. The features need to be tested independently, so they are deployed to QA1 and QA2.  Step 7: The QA team picks up the new QA environments and performs QA testing, regression testing, and performance testing.  Steps 8: Once the QA builds pass the QA teamâ€™s verification, they are deployed to the UAT environment.  Step 9: If the UAT testing is successful, the builds become release candidates and will be deployed to the production environment on schedule.  Step 10: SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team is responsible for prod monitoring.

What’s more, the microgrid can provide over $125,000 of energy savings per day during Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) peak demand periods. 

The microgrid was built using funds from a Defense Economic Adjustment Assistance Grant from the state of Texas. The city of Temple worked with Fort Cavazos and Dominion Energy to help secure the grant.

"Iâ€™ve never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services Iâ€™ve been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you canâ€™t access healthcare the way you should, itâ€™s terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldnâ€™t get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctorâ€™s office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. Iâ€™m especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI â€“ especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning â€“ was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate â€œdoctor speak,â€ to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. Itâ€™s easier than ever to build. (Iâ€™m currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning â€“ if I can do it, you can, too.)Iâ€™m excited to share with you whatâ€™s next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
📈 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
🖥 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
🏥 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
⌚ With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name 🤦🏽‍♂️)

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. That’s all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model that’s not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon? 😉

"Dear Leaders, if 80% of people work harder when they feel more appreciated, it is not about whether you work on recognition, but how!

Saying “thank you” doesn’t hurt you - but not saying “thank you” can hurt others. So, No brainer!

Start asking yourself the following questions as a leader:

💡What does recognition mean for me (e.g. mainly monetary)?
💡 What do I usually recognize my people for (e.g. doing their job, over-performing, learning new skills)?
💡 My people might expect very different recognition elements: Have I ever asked what they need to feel appreciated?
💡 Does my company have a recognition program I can use elements from?


And then take genuine and frequent action to build an environment of recognition:

1️⃣ Take the input from your team seriously and be as close to expectations as possible.
2️⃣ Recognize people based on specific results and behaviors - in 1:1 situations but more in the broader team. It helps appreciate the right behaviour and results more broadly.
3️⃣ Empower your people deliberately to then recognize their own decisions and ways of achieving results.
4️⃣ Recognize your people unexpectedly, it is more powerful.
5️⃣ Implement ways of top down (from your manager) and peer to peer recognition.
6️⃣ Make saying “thank you” a natural part of everyday work in the team an beyond.

If you establish a culture of recognition, you will also affect people in a way that might be new to you: Recognition has a physiological impact on performance. Oxytocin is the well-known “love hormone.” Our bodies create Oxytocin when we feel loved or appreciated.

"Big news. Google just introduced a method to steal model information from black-box production language models like ChatGPT or PaLM-2.""Our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively.""They focus on the model's embedding projection layer, which is the last layer of the model. This layer is responsible for translating the internal representations of data (the ""hidden dimensions"") into a format that the model can use to make predictions or generate text.

"This is just incredible! The first human Neuralink patient, who is paralyzed, can now control a computer and play chess just by thinking 😳

29-year-old Noland Arbaugh was paralyzed below the shoulder after a diving accident. Thanks to the brain chip startup's device he can now do things that were not possible before. For example, gaming 🕹️

""I had basically given up playing that game,"" Arbaugh said, referring to the game Civilization VI, ""you all (Neuralink) gave me the ability to do that again and played for 8 hours straight.""

It's really inspiring to see how Neuralink has meaningfully improved the patient’s joy in life.

More importantly, we must be thankful to entrepreneurs like Elon for having the vision and initiative to push for these kinds of enhancements, for people that desperately deserve them.

The crazy part? This is just the very beginning.

""Even if someone has never had vision ever, like they were born blind, we believe that we can still restore vision using Neuralink"" - Elon Musk
