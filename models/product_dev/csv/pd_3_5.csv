We have tens of millions of learners (just under 30M daily active users last quarter) and we use innovative thinking and experimentation to improve how we teach.Whenever we make a change to the Duolingo app, small or big, we first test to make sure it doesn't have a negative impact on our users or their ability to learn. We do the same for the course content, never making any change until it has been tested and shown to have positive effects on our learners' progress. But today, I want to talk about a class of experiments that surprised me. A few years ago, we started a team called ¨ Delight ¨. Delight was not tasked with improving our metrics; its purpose was to make the app more delightful. This can be anything from:’Animating the explosions that appear when you answer a hard question. Satisfying haptic feedback throughout your lesson¨Adding subtle sparkles across the appWe didn't expect these changes to have a positive effect on our numbers. But we tested them anyway. To our surprise, the animations do in fact keep people in the app longer and cause them to return to the app more often! ¨Delight facilitates learning¨, in ways we did not anticipate.Though we discovered that these animations *did* hurt the performance of one user segment: those who use Duolingo on lower-end devices. So we are able to turn off the more processing-intensive animations for these users to make sure their educational experience is not harmed ³Another thing I love about our experiment-driven culture is how it facilitates collaboration. When a cross-functional team (made up of product, engineering, design and others) has to move a metric, they brainstorm together ¡¸ come up with multiple ideas and hypotheses ¡¸ test them to see what moves the needle ¡¸ and iterate ” If you are an engineer who wants to contribute meaningfully to education, with a strong sense of how products can be continuously improved, you're one of us.

After about 10 years of blogging, I moved the blog to The Financial Brand for a few years, then blogged on Cornerstone's site for a couple of years before moving it again to Forbes and renaming it the Fintech Snark Tank.All told, I've published more than 1,600 blog posts about #banking and #fintech. In addition, since starting at Cornerstone in 2015, I've written ~100 research reports. Last summer, someone on the IT staff at Cornerstone suggested we develop a large language model (LLM) based on my blog posts and reports. The results of that effort--named FintechGPT--is ready to be unveiled. Unlike LLMs like #ChatGPT, FintechGPT doesn't hallucinate and is never wrong (unless, of course, I was wrong about something in the past 17 years, but that's not very likely).

[1][2][5]Starting April 1, 2024, Microsoft will introduce a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that do not include the Teams collaboration app. [1][5] This means that customers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland will now have the option to purchase Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions without Teams.The changes come after the European Commission launched an investigation in 2020 into Microsoft's bundling of Teams with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 packages, which competitors like Slack argued was anti-competitive. [6] Microsoft subsequently unbundled Teams from its European offerings in 2023. [1][2]""Globally consistent licensing helps ensure clarity for customers and streamline decision making and negotiations,"" Microsoft said in its announcement. [5] The move will give customers more flexibility in choosing the productivity tools that best fit their needs, without being forced to pay for Teams if they don't want it.However, some industry observers argue that the change is ""too little, too late"" as Microsoft has already amassed millions of Teams users globally during the pandemic. [6] Nonetheless, the decoupling of Teams from Microsoft's core productivity suites will be welcomed by businesses looking to use alternative collaboration tools.[1] https://lnkd.in/gvhv5eK9] https://lnkd.in/gU9RV6qs] https://lnkd.in/gvH8w_SX] https://lnkd.in/gaYQrp7ZSources[1] Changes to MS Teams licensing structure as of October 1, 2023 https://lnkd.in/gVxqxHUs[2] Important Microsoft 365 licensing changes in Europe https://lnkd.in/gJVjmb5G[3] Microsoft Teams Rooms Device Licensing Changes - Diversified https://lnkd.in/gJSvgPzS[4] Update!

This should allow those customers who don't want to use Teams to save on costs.  It will still be up to the competitors to figure out how counter with the way the MS Teams will still seamlessly integrate with M365 and the of Office 365 apps thar are pervasive with enterprise customers.Some of the competitors have done a good job of gaining a foothold into enterprises and earned trust during the challenge of the Pandemic.  I'll use Zoom as an example.  They have branded themselves as a communication & collaboration company but it's a challenge to get new business when customers say that they already have a MS Teams as part of their licensing they are paying for would rather figure out how to deploy that.Microsoft will definitely have to earn it but don't count them out as they will continue to put value into MS Teams.  It has only gotten better.  I was not fan of MS Teams 1.0.

Been a long time coming with #wallabywater to make this happen.""Benefits of Aluminum Bottles Compared to PET"" Aluminum bottles have several advantages over PET bottles. For one, they are more durable and can withstand higher temperatures, which makes them ideal for storing hot liquids. Additionally, aluminum bottles are recyclable and can be reused multiple times, making them a more sustainable option. On the other hand, PET bottles are lightweight and easy to transport, but they are not as environmentally-friendly as aluminum bottles. Overall, if you are looking for a more eco-friendly and sustainable option, aluminum bottles are the way to go.Environmental sustainability: Aluminum bottles have a significantly lower environmental footprint compared to PET bottles. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable without loss of quality, meaning it can be recycled repeatedly without degradation. This promotes a circular economy and reduces the need for virgin materials, ultimately conserving natural resources and reducing energy consumption associated with manufacturing.Reduced plastic pollution: By opting for aluminum bottles, consumers contribute to reducing plastic pollution. PET bottles are a significant source of single-use plastic waste, which often ends up in landfills or pollutes oceans and waterways. Aluminum bottles offer a reusable alternative that helps mitigate the environmental impact of plastic pollution.Long-term durability: Aluminum bottles are highly durable and resistant to damage compared to PET bottles. They are less prone to cracks, punctures, or degradation over time, ensuring a longer lifespan with proper care. This durability makes aluminum bottles suitable for various activities and environments, including outdoor adventures, sports, and travel.Improved beverage quality: Aluminum is inert and non-reactive, meaning it does not leach harmful chemicals into the water stored within it. This ensures that the taste, odor, and overall quality of the water remain unaffected, providing a clean and refreshing drinking experience.Thermal insulation: Aluminum bottles offer superior thermal insulation compared to PET bottles.Aesthetic appeal and customization: Aluminum bottles often feature sleek designs and customizable options, allowing brands and consumers to express their individual style preferences. This aesthetic appeal can enhance the overall user experience and promote brand loyalty.Brand sustainability initiatives: By adopting aluminum bottles for water packaging, brands can align with these values and showcase their commitment to eco-friendly practices, which may resonate positively with consumers.#Alumi-tek #AluminumBottles #PackagingIndustry #SustainablePackaging","Product Development,User Experience",,video,,Adam,Stowitz,Ball Corporation,Consumer & Industrial Products,Global Innovation Director,21,1,1,3w,,,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176080013467734016/,Adam Stowitts likes this,Likes,,2024-04-05 21:20,4/5/2024,Friday,Friday,9:20 PM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/20f36a92-749d-4aa6-8db5-71269680ef8b,,,,,,,,checked,,23,Engagement,9pm-10pm,April 2024,

Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

We were so successful that, today, the panel is not the biggest cost driver for solar deployments. For utility-scale, land and labor are often larger cost components. For residential rooftops, believe it or not, marketing and customer acquisition costs are often the largest expense. Perovskite-based tandems add value by tackling land and labor costs, greatly impacting the total cost of ownership (TCO). Since our panels can be 25-40% more efficient than conventional panels, that means we can save 25-40% of land and labor costs, often more than the entire cost of the panel itself!

She was an early PM of FigJam, is currently leading a new (undisclosed) product that's launching at Figma's Config conference this year, and is beloved by everyone who works with her.In our conversation, we discuss:”¸ Advice for taking ideas from 0 to 1 at larger companies”¸ How to craft a compelling vision”¸ How to tactically communicate your vision”¸ The importance of vulnerability and feedback”¸ Advice for building a strong team culture”¸ Pivoting priorities with grace and enthusiasm”¸ AI and its impact on PMs”¸ Much moreListen now YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gMed2MdGSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gbNUk-ZcApple: https://lnkd.in/gNb4pBDyKey takeaways:1. Putting ideas out there, even if they are wrong, can lead to better solutions and more productive discussions. It's not just about having a great idea or building a prototype; it's about actively engaging and rallying others around that idea to create momentum and excitement. Whether it's pitching ideas at events like hackathons or simply asking colleagues for assistance, the key is to not let perceived limitations hold you back from pursuing your vision.2. Mihika likens the role of a 0-to-1 team within a large company to that of Hestia in Greek mythology, who is the keeper of the hearth. It is Hestia's job to always keep the hearth burning, even while other gods go out on separate quests. This means always keeping the 0-to-1 project alive and helping it spread to others, mostly through setting vision and building hype.3. To set the vision for a new idea, ask: If I and my team do our job correctly, what does the world look like? Then convey the pain point, solution, and proof in a format that can show, not tell stakeholders what you're doing. For example, use prototypes, Figma mock-ups, and customer testimonials.4. Internal hackathons are a great way to encourage innovation. Figma has a Maker Week where the entire company”including technical and non-technical employees”goes on pause for a week to work on ambitious ideas. Maker Week and other internal hackathons have led to many successful Figma products, including Jambot and Figma's entire widget platform.5. Figma implements a fun hot seat tradition, where each person takes turns being in the hot seat for a set amount of time. During their turn, the person can be asked anything by the other members of the group. By understanding what motivates each team member and building strong relationships, collaboration becomes more effective, leading to a more enjoyable work environment and ultimately better outcomes for the product or project. The key is to create a comfortable and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels open to sharing.","Leadership,Product Development,AI/Machine Learning",,video,,Franscisco,Trejo,Caterpillar,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Head of Global eCommerce, CAT Digital at Caterpillar Inc.",1745,48,40,3d,,,,Francisco Trejo likes this,Likes,,2024-04-21 16:16,4/21/2024,Sunday,Sunday,4:16 PM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/21013aa5-727f-49b5-938d-874ec845029c,,,,,,,,checked,,1833,Engagement,4pm-5pm,April 2024,

I'm so excited to start implementing some of the learnings from the summit in our day-to-day at Sainsbury's, namely some of the amazing #GenAI features like background removal and generation, and object aware auto-crop for video (wow!). 

We also learnt all about their new Brand Pulse tool, illustrating how upper funnel activity ultimately drives conversion, and where we’re gaining incremental reach in real time using a feedback loop. Along with their cross-channel PBA (predictive budget allocation) solution, coming soon, and loads of other cool new features.

What an amazing couple of days spent with colleagues, the brilliant Smartly team and lots of new faces across their global network of clients. Not only did we get to learn about all the exciting new features on the Smartly roadmap for 2024, 2025 and beyond, we also got to experience some wonderful Finnish hospitality, true to Smartly's 'work hard, play hard' culture!

So what’s the story? 

The sobering reality is that the magic of reading books is slowly being replaced by other forms of media. Each successive generation is enjoying fewer of the well known benefits that come with getting lost in a wonderful book (cognitive development, creativity, empathy, to name but a few).

What if we could reverse this trend? What if we could find a way to make reading just as ‘engaging’ as watching Netflix, and eventually the 1st entertainment choice for children?

And so we wrote Yuna into existence. By combining AI with the enchantment of human creativity, Yuna writes books that are so personalised and interactive that they can be as engaging as any modern media platforms. Leveraging AI to empower writers, illustrators and publishers, Yuna imagines new forms of storytelling:

✨ Imagine a book that every night writes the next chapter of a personalised adventure involving you, your daughter and dog, weaving your family’s interests into the narrative.

✨ Imagine a book that invites your niece to enter Hogwarts as a 1st year student and experience their own unique story through the wizarding world.

✨ Imagine a book that helps you discuss difficult topics with your son but in the form of an imaginary tale with him and his favourite character Snoopy. 

Over time, we hope to make these dreams come true, all with a singular goal: to ensure that children build a healthy reading habit for life.

Thanks to the hard work of the incredible Yuna team, we’ve been testing early versions of these ideas. Over the past 5 months, Yuna has written 100,000+ unique stories to 20,000 monthly active users. And we are growing fast - we expect to write the next 100,000 books within a few weeks of this announcement. Thank you Yuna team - you are truly epic.

A massive thank you to the partners involved in our $1.6M pre-seed round: Canary who led and who have been incredible every day since (special shoutout to Florian Hagenbuch who has been a believer and mentor from day -1); The Positive Ventures team and angel investors who followed the round and recognised Yuna’s potential to make a positive impact on the world (thank you especially to Fábio Kestenbaum!). Finally - Taahir Munshi, Pedro Sônego de Oliveira, Flora Oliveira, Fabian Wikstrom and Carolina Guimarães, who played pivotal roles in turning Yuna from distant dream to reality during those early days. 

Now what?

Today, we are launching our beta test product in Brazil in Portuguese. If you are in Brazil, please give it a shot (see link in comments). If you are not, Yuna isn’t available to test just yet, but fear not! Yuna is bringing its vision to the 🌎 very soon.

A succinct, bold, 1-2 sentence statement that describes the change your company wants to make in the world.

That’s a company vision, not a product vision.

A product vision, on the other hand, is a ""detailed enough"" description of the actual solution you intend to build, over time, in order to realize the company vision. 

Here are some examples of great company visions: 
- Stripe: Increase the GDP of the internet
- Google: Provide access to the world’s information in one click
- LinkedIn: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce 

Hopefully, it’s clear that none of these provide any meaningful product vision or direction.

For example, Google's product people could have pursued the company vision by building a universally accessible, multimedia encyclopedia. That would have been one product vision (anyone remember Microsoft Encarta?).

Or, they could have envisioned a better search engine and gotten to work on that. 

Product visions can take many formats, from a simple “written story” that describes a customer’s experience with the future product, to a “visiontype” comprised of (often annotated) mock-ups of the key elements of the product.

All good product visions, regardless of the format are:
- inspiring
- customer-centric
- successful at bringing the solution to life, at least in broad strokes. 

Speaking of broad strokes — good product visions are clear without being overly prescriptive. They are directive enough to provide a solid “north star” for the product team(s) to work towards, while challenging those teams to figure out the details over time.

Does your company have a true product vision, or are you under the illusion that your company vision is enough?","Product Development,Customer Centricity",,infographic,,Franscisco,Trejo,Caterpillar,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Head of Global eCommerce, CAT Digital at Caterpillar Inc.",252,17,10,3w,,,,Francisco Trejo likes this,Likes,,2024-05-06 10:23,5/6/2024,Monday,Monday,10:23 AM,,,,,,,,,,,279,Engagement,10am-11am,May 2024,checked

What's new is that AlphaFold-3 uses diffusion to ""render"" the molecular structure. It starts from a fuzzy cloud of atoms and then materializes the molecule gradually through denoising. We live on a timeline where learnings from Llama and Sora can inform and accelerate life sciences. 

I find this level of generality absolutely mind-boggling. The same transformer+diffusion backbone that generates fancy pixels can also imagine proteins, as long as you convert the data to sequences of floats accordingly.

We are not there yet at a single AGI model, but we have successfully built a menu of general-purpose AI recipes that transfer training techniques, data pipelines, and neural architectures across domains that don't seem related. This should not work, but thank god it does!

Congrats to DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs!

1. LLMs are probabilistic beasts and although very powerful, should not be exposed directly to any enterprise user without adequate expertise layers between them. This is our #sootras and #neeyums framework.

2. Building this expertise layer requires all skill sets, not only an understanding of how LLMs work but also classical ML and strong software engineering skills. Yes, the death of software engineering is nowhere in sight. Don’t let Devin fool you.

3. Scalability is a real issue. We can all feel excited about long context windows but neither that nor classical RAG will protect you from the stress of spiraling API costs. At samvid.ai , we have achieved success in resolving this issue through our concept of #essence repositories backed up by our #sootras and #neeyums 

Don’t buy into the gimmicks of using an LLM out of the box, the end of software engineering or long context windows. Chasing those gimmicks can be fatal. 

Talk to us today.

Here's the top one's:

1. Understanding and commitment

It's not enough to just have engineering, product, and design on board for transformation.

Transformation has vast impacts for marketing, sales, customer success, finance, and the rest of the business. 

You need to drive top-down alignment from the CEO and Senior Leadership Team to bring all these diverse functions along.

2. Shifting culture

Cultural shift is often the hardest element of a transformation:

• Sales is still used to promising features
• Marketing is still used to dates on when features will arrive
• Customer support is used to having a direct hand in the roadmap

All of these things take time. The mistake people make is to gloss over the real tensions for the sake of meeting a pre-planned schedule.

Things may take longer than you think.

3. Co-create selected processes

Process is generally seen as the problem in transformation, so the point isn't to add in massive amounts of process.

But it's impossible to have no process. You'll still need a way to lock in what features the team is building, say, next quarter.

You want to co-create these bottoms-up with the teams and functions in the org, and adjust as necessary. No one wants a book's interpretation of processes. They want something they created for the specific needs of your org.

4. Building capabilities

As you align on processes and shift the culture, there's still going to be capability gaps. Don't assume the game is quite over yet. 

This is where a lot of teams go wrong. They don't build the capabilities to win the trust of executives and other functions like sales and marketing, because:

• PMs lack domain expertise
• Designers are under-hired relative to engineering
• Product leaders lack experience in truly empowered product environments

All sorts of capability gaps like these prevent success. You have to be ready to invest to upskill the org, and pay for experienced talent where needed. 

This means buying the reforge subscription, paying for the newsletter, hiring the coaches and experts...

5. Sustaining and scaling

There's still the possibility that your CEO seizes back control, or Sales begins to take over more as it drives more of the new revenue. 

The way to stop these things is building mechanisms to sustain at scale. You need feedback loops. You need talent who can flag it before it becomes pervasive.

These things are possible for most. You can't just move into discovery in the new world without acknowledging the journey to get there.

It requires sustained effort and focus.

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry load’s carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now “Tide Cold Certified” – meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well – or even better – in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. It’s a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And we’re proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tide’s ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

A seamless #SupplyChain is key to our mission to deliver everyday moments of care when people need them most. And there are so many behind-the-scenes links that make up this supply chain. It starts with our trusted suppliers. 
 
It’s not every day you have the opportunity to gather so many incredible companies in the same room, but that’s exactly what we did when we launched our new supplier program this week. Not only did we introduce leaders from key suppliers to Kenvue as a stand-alone company, giving the event an extra-special energy, but around every corner we found new ways to grow together, including supporting our Healthy Lives Mission. We’re leaving that room with a shared vision for the future.
 
I have every confidence in our ability execute with excellence and meaningfully impact consumers.

This unique project took place alongside a road, where our customer took advantage of a planned road closure to efficiently maintain their pipeline.  The GoVAC® MAX System was deployed to evacuate the pipe, allowing the customer ample time to complete necessary maintenance. Our dedicated team was on-site, working diligently to get the job done swiftly and efficiently.

Well done, team!

Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 🚀

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
- 📤 Gets trigged from a new hire event
- 👋 Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-  📊 Reasons over data to answer employee questions 
- 📚 Recommends personalized training based on employee background 

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks. 
- 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time. 
- 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks. 
- 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls. 

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview. 
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

The electrical grid is becoming more complex to manage as distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewables proliferate. Aging physical infrastructure, increasing extreme weather events, and a retiring utility workforce create a more challenging operating context that threatens utilities’ ability to reliably provide electricity to their customers. 

ThinkLabs’ autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs’ capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.

Powerhouse Ventures is proud to co-lead ThinkLabs’ $5M Seed with Active Impact Investments, with additional participation from Blackhorn Ventures, Amplify Capital, Mercuria, and a national US energy company. We look forward to working with Founder & CEO Josh Wong and the entire ThinkLabs team to build the digital backbone of the modern grid.

Thanks to Maeve Allsup at Latitude Media and Josh Scott at BetaKit for covering ThinkLabs’ seed round:

We’re extremely fortunate to such friendly people onsite esp. Mike and Jeff who helped educate us deeply about their onsite processes, letting us throw and catch mods ourselves by hand, giving us insights to fine tune and improve robot and flow of work cycle times. When we release XR-002, these guys are the ones directly responsible for some key updates - Forever appreciative 💛

And of course, our robot production numbers would be zero if it wasn’t for our fantastic crew mates: Angel, Orlando, Edwardo, Chino, & Maritza.
