"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.

"One of our Duolingo operating principles is test it first. I love the sheer scale of our testing; we run hundreds of simultaneous A/B tests to find new ways to teach more effectively. We have tens of millions of learners (just under 30M daily active users last quarter) and we use innovative thinking and experimentation to improve how we teach.Whenever we make a change to the Duolingo app, small or big, we first test to make sure it doesn't have a negative impact on our users or their ability to learn. We do the same for the course content, never making any change until it has been tested and shown to have positive effects on our learners' progress. But today, I want to talk about a class of experiments that surprised me. A few years ago, we started a team called   Delight  . Delight was not tasked with improving our metrics; its purpose was to make the app more delightful. This can be anything from:Animating the explosions that appear when you answer a hard question. Satisfying haptic feedback throughout your lesson Adding subtle sparkles across the appWe didn't expect these changes to have a positive effect on our numbers. But we tested them anyway. To our surprise, the animations do in fact keep people in the app longer and cause them to return to the app more often!  Delight facilitates learning , in ways we did not anticipate.Though we discovered that these animations *did* hurt the performance of one user segment: those who use Duolingo on lower-end devices. So we are able to turn off the more processing-intensive animations for these users to make sure their educational experience is not harmed 3Another thing I love about our experiment-driven culture is how it facilitates collaboration. When a cross-functional team (made up of product, engineering, design and others) has to move a metric, they brainstorm together   come up with multiple ideas and hypotheses   test them to see what moves the needle   and iterate  If you are an engineer who wants to contribute meaningfully to education, with a strong sense of how products can be continuously improved, you're one of us.

"Success often starts small before rapidly scaling. We exemplified this with Zerup - a sugar-free syrup allowing you to craft wildly flavored drinks.  We launched Zerup with just one small production line to test the concept. Seeing immense demand after a few months, we boldly invested in scaling up with multiple major production line expansions. Zerup went from a novel idea to a booming success by starting lean, validating the market through real consumer adoption, and then aggressively scaling operations to meet skyrocketing demand.   Now over 1,000,000 bottles fly off shelves monthly!But why so popular? 40% of people drink <1.5L daily - impacting health & metabolism. We saw an opportunity to make water tasty without sacrificing fun!  Eighteen months ago, we developed Zerup - squeeze into any drink for wildly flavored H2O with 1-2 splashes. No sugar!This journey highlights the power of testing new concepts at a manageable size, then rapidly scaling proven winners.  We transformed Zerup from modest origins into a breakthrough 1M+/month hit!  kudos to Daniel Loidl & Nicolas Lother for enabling this.","Product Development,Organizational Change Management"

"Microsoft Teams Decouples from Office 365 GloballyIn a move that will be welcomed by many businesses, Microsoft has announced that it is extending the changes it made to Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licensing in Europe to the rest of the world. [1][2][5]Starting April 1, 2024, Microsoft will introduce a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that do not include the Teams collaboration app. [1][5] This means that customers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland will now have the option to purchase Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions without Teams.The changes come after the European Commission launched an investigation in 2020 into Microsoft's bundling of Teams with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 packages, which competitors like Slack argued was anti-competitive. [6] Microsoft subsequently unbundled Teams from its European offerings in 2023. [1][2]""Globally consistent licensing helps ensure clarity for customers and streamline decision making and negotiations,"" Microsoft said in its announcement. [5] The move will give customers more flexibility in choosing the productivity tools that best fit their needs, without being forced to pay for Teams if they don't want it.However, some industry observers argue that the change is ""too little, too late"" as Microsoft has already amassed millions of Teams users globally during the pandemic. [6] Nonetheless, the decoupling of Teams from Microsoft's core productivity suites will be welcomed by businesses looking to use alternative collaboration tools.[1] https://lnkd.in/gvhv5eK9] https://lnkd.in/gU9RV6qs] https://lnkd.in/gvH8w_SX] https://lnkd.in/gaYQrp7ZSources[1] Changes to MS Teams licensing structure as of October 1, 2023 https://lnkd.in/gVxqxHUs[2] Important Microsoft 365 licensing changes in Europe https://lnkd.in/gJVjmb5G[3] Microsoft Teams Rooms Device Licensing Changes - Diversified https://lnkd.in/gJSvgPzS[4] Update!

"Great working with our Partner East Coast Canning + Printing on another project to bring ROPP Bottle and Standard Beverage Cans off the same Codi Filling Machine.  Been a long time coming with #wallabywater to make this happen.""Benefits of Aluminum Bottles Compared to PET"" Aluminum bottles have several advantages over PET bottles. For one, they are more durable and can withstand higher temperatures, which makes them ideal for storing hot liquids. Additionally, aluminum bottles are recyclable and can be reused multiple times, making them a more sustainable option. On the other hand, PET bottles are lightweight and easy to transport, but they are not as environmentally-friendly as aluminum bottles. Overall, if you are looking for a more eco-friendly and sustainable option, aluminum bottles are the way to go.Environmental sustainability: Aluminum bottles have a significantly lower environmental footprint compared to PET bottles. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable without loss of quality, meaning it can be recycled repeatedly without degradation. This promotes a circular economy and reduces the need for virgin materials, ultimately conserving natural resources and reducing energy consumption associated with manufacturing.Reduced plastic pollution: By opting for aluminum bottles, consumers contribute to reducing plastic pollution. PET bottles are a significant source of single-use plastic waste, which often ends up in landfills or pollutes oceans and waterways. Aluminum bottles offer a reusable alternative that helps mitigate the environmental impact of plastic pollution.Long-term durability: Aluminum bottles are highly durable and resistant to damage compared to PET bottles. They are less prone to cracks, punctures, or degradation over time, ensuring a longer lifespan with proper care. This durability makes aluminum bottles suitable for various activities and environments, including outdoor adventures, sports, and travel.Improved beverage quality: Aluminum is inert and non-reactive, meaning it does not leach harmful chemicals into the water stored within it. This ensures that the taste, odor, and overall quality of the water remain unaffected, providing a clean and refreshing drinking experience.Thermal insulation: Aluminum bottles offer superior thermal insulation compared to PET bottles.Aesthetic appeal and customization: Aluminum bottles often feature sleek designs and customizable options, allowing brands and consumers to express their individual style preferences. This aesthetic appeal can enhance the overall user experience and promote brand loyalty.Brand sustainability initiatives: By adopting aluminum bottles for water packaging, brands can align with these values and showcase their commitment to eco-friendly practices, which may resonate positively with consumers.#Alumi-tek #AluminumBottles #PackagingIndustry #SustainablePackaging","Product Development,User Experience"

"It was great to see the progress made on Newell Brands' packaging sustainability goals we communicated over the last few years. Here are a few of the learnings from the process and after talking with other companies. 1.  Develop proof of concept reporting systems and baseline where you are at before setting goals. Data collection, validation and reporting can be very time-consuming.2. Develop goals based on external stakeholder needs (e.g. consumers, customers, investors, regulators) and align with internal stakeholders' ambitions. Its ok to admit your company may not want to be the industry leader. You can pick strategic areas to go beyond goals.3. Understand the technical feasibility of goals. That includes an understanding of the current state of infrastructure. This is especially true for 100% recyclability goals. Unfortunately, the U.S. infrastructure can't support most of these goals yet. 4. Create great partnerships with those tasked with meeting the goals (e.g. packaging engineers). This includes providing the tools and support necessary to meet the goals.Please share any others you may have.

"For decades, the only mantra for the solar industry was to relentlessly drive the costs of the panel down, down, down. We were so successful that, today, the panel is not the biggest cost driver for solar deployments. For utility-scale, land and labor are often larger cost components. For residential rooftops, believe it or not, marketing and customer acquisition costs are often the largest expense. Perovskite-based tandems add value by tackling land and labor costs, greatly impacting the total cost of ownership (TCO). Since our panels can be 25-40% more efficient than conventional panels, that means we can save 25-40% of land and labor costs, often more than the entire cost of the panel itself!

She was an early PM of FigJam, is currently leading a new (undisclosed) product that's launching at Figma's Config conference this year, and is beloved by everyone who works with her.In our conversation, we discuss:  Advice for taking ideas from 0 to 1 at larger companies  How to craft a compelling vision  How to tactically communicate your vision  The importance of vulnerability and feedback  Advice for building a strong team culture  Pivoting priorities with grace and enthusiasm  AI and its impact on PMs  Much moreListen now YouTube: https://lnkd.in/gMed2MdGSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gbNUk-ZcApple: https://lnkd.in/gNb4pBDyKey takeaways:1. Putting ideas out there, even if they are wrong, can lead to better solutions and more productive discussions. It's not just about having a great idea or building a prototype; it's about actively engaging and rallying others around that idea to create momentum and excitement. Whether it's pitching ideas at events like hackathons or simply asking colleagues for assistance, the key is to not let perceived limitations hold you back from pursuing your vision.2. Mihika likens the role of a 0-to-1 team within a large company to that of Hestia in Greek mythology, who is the keeper of the hearth. It is Hestia's job to always keep the hearth burning, even while other gods go out on separate quests. This means always keeping the 0-to-1 project alive and helping it spread to others, mostly through setting vision and building hype.3. To set the vision for a new idea, ask: If I and my team do our job correctly, what does the world look like? Then convey the pain point, solution, and proof in a format that can show, not tell stakeholders what you're doing. For example, use prototypes, Figma mock-ups, and customer testimonials.4. Internal hackathons are a great way to encourage innovation. Figma has a Maker Week where the entire companyincluding technical and non-technical employeesgoes on pause for a week to work on ambitious ideas. Maker Week and other internal hackathons have led to many successful Figma products, including Jambot and Figma's entire widget platform.5. Figma implements a fun hot seat tradition, where each person takes turns being in the hot seat for a set amount of time. During their turn, the person can be asked anything by the other members of the group. By understanding what motivates each team member and building strong relationships, collaboration becomes more effective, leading to a more enjoyable work environment and ultimately better outcomes for the product or project. The key is to create a comfortable and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels open to sharing.","Leadership,Product Development,AI/Machine Learning"

" Im excited to announce what weve been working on for the last few months: the creation of Yuna, an AI and storytelling startup, and our $1.6 million dollar pre-seed round  

So whats the story? 

The sobering reality is that the magic of reading books is slowly being replaced by other forms of media. Each successive generation is enjoying fewer of the well known benefits that come with getting lost in a wonderful book (cognitive development, creativity, empathy, to name but a few).

What if we could reverse this trend? What if we could find a way to make reading just as engaging as watching Netflix, and eventually the 1st entertainment choice for children?

And so we wrote Yuna into existence. By combining AI with the enchantment of human creativity, Yuna writes books that are so personalised and interactive that they can be as engaging as any modern media platforms. Leveraging AI to empower writers, illustrators and publishers, Yuna imagines new forms of storytelling:

 Imagine a book that every night writes the next chapter of a personalised adventure involving you, your daughter and dog, weaving your familys interests into the narrative.

 Imagine a book that invites your niece to enter Hogwarts as a 1st year student and experience their own unique story through the wizarding world.

 Imagine a book that helps you discuss difficult topics with your son but in the form of an imaginary tale with him and his favourite character Snoopy. 

Over time, we hope to make these dreams come true, all with a singular goal: to ensure that children build a healthy reading habit for life.

Thanks to the hard work of the incredible Yuna team, weve been testing early versions of these ideas. Over the past 5 months, Yuna has written 100,000+ unique stories to 20,000 monthly active users. And we are growing fast - we expect to write the next 100,000 books within a few weeks of this announcement. Thank you Yuna team - you are truly epic.

A massive thank you to the partners involved in our $1.6M pre-seed round: Canary who led and who have been incredible every day since (special shoutout to Florian Hagenbuch who has been a believer and mentor from day -1); The Positive Ventures team and angel investors who followed the round and recognised Yunas potential to make a positive impact on the world (thank you especially to Fabio Kestenbaum!). Finally - Taahir Munshi, Pedro Sonego de Oliveira, Flora Oliveira, Fabian Wikstrom and Carolina Guimaraes, who played pivotal roles in turning Yuna from distant dream to reality during those early days. 

Now what?

Today, we are launching our beta test product in Brazil in Portuguese. If you are in Brazil, please give it a shot (see link in comments). If you are not, Yuna isnt available to test just yet, but fear not! Yuna is bringing its vision to the  very soon.

"Heres what a product vision is not:

A succinct, bold, 1-2 sentence statement that describes the change your company wants to make in the world.

Thats a company vision, not a product vision.

A product vision, on the other hand, is a ""detailed enough"" description of the actual solution you intend to build, over time, in order to realize the company vision. 

Here are some examples of great company visions: 
- Stripe: Increase the GDP of the internet
- Google: Provide access to the worlds information in one click
- LinkedIn: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce 

Hopefully, its clear that none of these provide any meaningful product vision or direction.

For example, Google's product people could have pursued the company vision by building a universally accessible, multimedia encyclopedia. That would have been one product vision (anyone remember Microsoft Encarta?).

Or, they could have envisioned a better search engine and gotten to work on that. 

Product visions can take many formats, from a simple written story that describes a customers experience with the future product, to a visiontype comprised of (often annotated) mock-ups of the key elements of the product.

All good product visions, regardless of the format are:
- inspiring
- customer-centric
- successful at bringing the solution to life, at least in broad strokes. 

Speaking of broad strokes  good product visions are clear without being overly prescriptive. They are directive enough to provide a solid north star for the product team(s) to work towards, while challenging those teams to figure out the details over time.

Does your company have a true product vision, or are you under the illusion that your company vision is enough?","Product Development,Customer Centricity"

It starts from a fuzzy cloud of atoms and then materializes the molecule gradually through denoising. We live on a timeline where learnings from Llama and Sora can inform and accelerate life sciences. 

I find this level of generality absolutely mind-boggling. The same transformer+diffusion backbone that generates fancy pixels can also imagine proteins, as long as you convert the data to sequences of floats accordingly.

We are not there yet at a single AGI model, but we have successfully built a menu of general-purpose AI recipes that transfer training techniques, data pipelines, and neural architectures across domains that don't seem related. This should not work, but thank god it does!

Congrats to DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs!

"After several months of boring through product development along with the wonderful team at samvid.ai , here is what I can say for sure about building enterprise AI using LLMs. 

1. LLMs are probabilistic beasts and although very powerful, should not be exposed directly to any enterprise user without adequate expertise layers between them. This is our #sootras and #neeyums framework.

2. Building this expertise layer requires all skill sets, not only an understanding of how LLMs work but also classical ML and strong software engineering skills. Yes, the death of software engineering is nowhere in sight. Dont let Devin fool you.

3. Scalability is a real issue. We can all feel excited about long context windows but neither that nor classical RAG will protect you from the stress of spiraling API costs. At samvid.ai , we have achieved success in resolving this issue through our concept of #essence repositories backed up by our #sootras and #neeyums 

Dont buy into the gimmicks of using an LLM out of the box, the end of software engineering or long context windows. Chasing those gimmicks can be fatal.

"There's so many ways orgs mess up transforming the product team away from the feature factory. Here's the top one's:

1. Understanding and commitment

It's not enough to just have engineering, product, and design on board for transformation.

Transformation has vast impacts for marketing, sales, customer success, finance, and the rest of the business. 

You need to drive top-down alignment from the CEO and Senior Leadership Team to bring all these diverse functions along.

2. Shifting culture

Cultural shift is often the hardest element of a transformation:

 Sales is still used to promising features
 Marketing is still used to dates on when features will arrive
 Customer support is used to having a direct hand in the roadmap

All of these things take time. The mistake people make is to gloss over the real tensions for the sake of meeting a pre-planned schedule.

Things may take longer than you think.

3. Co-create selected processes

Process is generally seen as the problem in transformation, so the point isn't to add in massive amounts of process.

But it's impossible to have no process. You'll still need a way to lock in what features the team is building, say, next quarter.

You want to co-create these bottoms-up with the teams and functions in the org, and adjust as necessary. No one wants a book's interpretation of processes. They want something they created for the specific needs of your org.

4. Building capabilities

As you align on processes and shift the culture, there's still going to be capability gaps. Don't assume the game is quite over yet. 

This is where a lot of teams go wrong. They don't build the capabilities to win the trust of executives and other functions like sales and marketing, because:

 PMs lack domain expertise
 Designers are under-hired relative to engineering
 Product leaders lack experience in truly empowered product environments

All sorts of capability gaps like these prevent success. You have to be ready to invest to upskill the org, and pay for experienced talent where needed. 

This means buying the reforge subscription, paying for the newsletter, hiring the coaches and experts...

5. Sustaining and scaling

There's still the possibility that your CEO seizes back control, or Sales begins to take over more as it drives more of the new revenue. 

The way to stop these things is building mechanisms to sustain at scale. You need feedback loops. You need talent who can flag it before it becomes pervasive.

These things are possible for most. You can't just move into discovery in the new world without acknowledging the journey to get there.

It requires sustained effort and focus.

"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
-  Gets trigged from a new hire event
-  Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-   Reasons over data to answer employee questions 
-  Recommends personalized training based on employee background 

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- Orchestration of complex tasks. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks. 
- Memory and context. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time. 
- Monitoring and improving. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks. 
- Delegation with confidence and guardrails. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls. 

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview. 
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

" At Lumos, we raised a $35m Series B from Scale Venture Partners with Andreessen Horowitz, Neo and Harpoon Ventures participating. 

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

The electrical grid is becoming more complex to manage as distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewables proliferate. Aging physical infrastructure, increasing extreme weather events, and a retiring utility workforce create a more challenging operating context that threatens utilities ability to reliably provide electricity to their customers. 

ThinkLabs autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.
