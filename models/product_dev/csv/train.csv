"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.

"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not Product Development

Because of this and because of Langdon, I have changed the direction of my life to helping those who suffer from mental health issues or those who care for them.Why am I posting this today? Today is Langdon's 23rd birthday, and I know he would not want someone to have to talk in hushed tones or feel alone. I don't know who said this, but there are many Suicide loss survivors who need to hear this.

"Ys Achieved Amazon Ads Retail Certification! YsE-commerce and retail media, in particular, have grown incredibly over the past couple of years. At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible. I loved diving deep into the Amazon Ads Retail Certification course where I learned about retail readiness, Amazon's fulfillment solutions, the different aspects of selling on Amazon.com, how to launch a new product on Amazon.com, as well as, navigating Seller Central and Vendor Central. I highly recommend this course for anyone in advertising and marketing who wants to understand e-commerce operations and advertising campaigns.

"Let's recap what appears to be complete BS against Trump. The man wins an election against an unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton
. They pay for a fake dossier and claim it's not the American people who elected him but the Russians. A Special Counsel is appointed, millions of dollars are spent, and the conclusion is that there was never any collusion between Trump and the Russians. It was the American people who elected him. It was complete BS.

Once in the White House, a woman writes a memoir and claims Trump sexually assaulted her several decades ago. Trump says no, I never did what she is accusing me of. New York then changes the law so she could bring charges decades after. She's actually unable to provide any direct evidence because she waited decades to report the alleged assault. The case proceeds anyway; eventually, after back and forth, Trump has to pay her millions of dollars for defamation. In interviews, she says she can't wait to receive the money so that she can go shopping worldwide. She also says the sexual assault was never sexual; claims rape is sexy. The media ignores the inconsistencies because that's not what the so-called deep state wants.

A porn actress also comes out and says she had an affair with Trump decades ago, and Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. The government says, wow! That's such huge information, had the American people known that they would have elected Clinton. Several people say there's no case to be made there; eventually, the case goes to court with the government claiming that he did not specifically disclose that the legal fee was somehow a campaign contribution. Anyway, they convict Trump. Meanwhile, the porn industry exploits all these women and men, paying them only a small fee once to shoot their movies and using them for decades without ever paying them any other fee. One would think a government that cares about porn actresses would try to help them and stop the exploitation. No, they actually don't care.

I can go on and on. When junior journalists receive information from the government in the form of indictments, they often believe everything the government says, that they are just there trying to punish deadly criminals in society, that they are trying to stop a dangerous guy. Meanwhile, the so-called dangerous man has not done all the atrocities others have done in terms of laws that punish ordinary people, including some based on their race, and bombs all over the world that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Of course, Trump is not a perfect man. People attack him; he also attacks people, and so do you.

But the false claim that he's the worst American to have ever lived and that now he's akin to Adolf Hitler and if he's re-elected again, doom and gloom would envelop the United States are simply false. Now they are claiming that he's so crazy he might attack Biden on stage on June 27 when they debate in Atlanta next week. The hypocrisy is really disgusting.

"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams.

The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work. To Raghuveer ., Atmaja Apsangi, Sumit Agrawal, Sombir Kadian, I extend my gratitude for fostering the Shark Idea Tank platform, a catalyst that expedited my innovation journey and exposed me to a realm of other ground-breaking ideas.

"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

It uses a factorized approach that not only allows us to train video generation models more efficiently but also produces higher quality video generations.The outputs of this model were preferred by 96% of respondents over our previous model based on output quality in human evaluations.2i a Emu EditThis new model is capable of free-form editing through text instructions. Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs "" the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"Earlier this year, some AWS developers created an internal tool for Amazonians to experiment with Foundation Models from Amazon Bedrock, and it quickly became a word-of-mouth hit across AWS.Because the interface only required a user to add in a description of the app they wanted to build in a prompt box, the tool could be used by teammates across a wide spectrum of roles and technical expertise.Some built apps for productivity, while others made ones for amusement, or that tapped into personal passions. It was cool to see builders get inspired by using generative AI in a more hands on way, and by sharing their apps with each other, they were actually sharing key generative AI techniques in action.Based on the popularity and feedback, we launched this simple to use but powerful app to the world for free, naming it PartyRock (in reference to it being a fun and collaborative  way to experience Amazon Bedrock). It is built on the belief that everyone should have access to a fun and easy tool to help get started with generative AI.Since launching it last week, tens of thousands of apps have been built and shared, and the creativity has been really cool to see (including apps to organize your re:Invent schedule, plan a Formula 1 trip, and find the best coffee in Vegas).

At UHC, we've seen that almost 10% of our members who are looking at benefits in our app end up searching for mental health services. Jen Mahoney, Sandra Long and team are doing their best to provide our members with the help they need. At the end of last year, this team launched some very significant features for millions of members, such as:

Care Explorer - Helping members find the right wellness journey for their mental health. Members complete a survey to get personalized recommendations for care and providers. This helps members to start finding care for themselves and their dependents. 

Child and Family Coaching  Mental health matters for everyone, not just adults: it affects entire families. We think we can make a significant difference in the US by providing more mental health services for the whole family.

More availability, and simpler  more convenient access to behavioral health support  including quicker appointments and tailored therapy.

I am so proud of being able to work alongside brilliant and compassionate people like Sandra Long and Jen Mahoney (and the dozens of others who helped bring this to reality) - who are making it matter every day for millions of consumers!

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

We believe we are the first to really combine evidence-based wellness products, apps, and education with direct links to the clinical services of high quality health care providers into one experience. Now, people can have a trusted wellness marketplace linked to their trusted provider for their total health and wellness needs. 

Many more person-centered goals and categories are coming soon. You will also see the launch of the other founding health systems this year.

"How do companies ship code to production? ..--Subscribe to our weekly newsletter to get a Free System Design PDF (158 pages): https://lnkd.in/g9wAgcke-- The diagram below illustrates the typical workflow.  Step 1: The process starts with a product owner creating user stories based on requirements.  Step 2: The dev team picks up the user stories from the backlog and puts them into a sprint for a two-week dev cycle.  Step 3: The developers commit source code into the code repository Git.  Step 4: A build is triggered in Jenkins. The source code must pass unit tests, code coverage threshold, and gates in SonarQube.  Step 5: Once the build is successful, the build is stored in artifactory. Then the build is deployed into the dev environment.  Step 6: There might be multiple dev teams working on different features. The features need to be tested independently, so they are deployed to QA1 and QA2.  Step 7: The QA team picks up the new QA environments and performs QA testing, regression testing, and performance testing.  Steps 8: Once the QA builds pass the QA team's verification, they are deployed to the UAT environment.  Step 9: If the UAT testing is successful, the builds become release candidates and will be deployed to the production environment on schedule.

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. It's easier than ever to build. (I'm currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning "" if I can do it, you can, too.)I'm excited to share with you what's next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another. 

During our first 2024 Innovation Open House session last week, we hosted 20+ attendees from 7 healthcare organizations across the country. We would love to have you join us for future sessions.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name )

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. Thats all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model thats not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon?

"Dear Leaders, if 80% of people work harder when they feel more appreciated, it is not about whether you work on recognition, but how!

Saying thank you doesnt hurt you - but not saying thank you can hurt others. So, No brainer!

Start asking yourself the following questions as a leader:

What does recognition mean for me (e.g. mainly monetary)?
 What do I usually recognize my people for (e.g. doing their job, over-performing, learning new skills)?
 My people might expect very different recognition elements: Have I ever asked what they need to feel appreciated?
 Does my company have a recognition program I can use elements from?


And then take genuine and frequent action to build an environment of recognition:

1 Take the input from your team seriously and be as close to expectations as possible.
2 Recognize people based on specific results and behaviors - in 1:1 situations but more in the broader team. It helps appreciate the right behaviour and results more broadly.
3 Empower your people deliberately to then recognize their own decisions and ways of achieving results.
4 Recognize your people unexpectedly, it is more powerful.
5 Implement ways of top down (from your manager) and peer to peer recognition.
6 Make saying thank you a natural part of everyday work in the team an beyond.

If you establish a culture of recognition, you will also affect people in a way that might be new to you: Recognition has a physiological impact on performance. Oxytocin is the well-known love hormone. Our bodies create Oxytocin when we feel loved or appreciated.

"This is just incredible! The first human Neuralink patient, who is paralyzed, can now control a computer and play chess just by thinking 

29-year-old Noland Arbaugh was paralyzed below the shoulder after a diving accident. Thanks to the brain chip startup's device he can now do things that were not possible before. For example, gaming 

""I had basically given up playing that game,"" Arbaugh said, referring to the game Civilization VI, ""you all (Neuralink) gave me the ability to do that again and played for 8 hours straight.""

It's really inspiring to see how Neuralink has meaningfully improved the patients joy in life.

More importantly, we must be thankful to entrepreneurs like Elon for having the vision and initiative to push for these kinds of enhancements, for people that desperately deserve them.

The crazy part? This is just the very beginning.

Several organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI for a variety of use cases, and whether they are in experimentation, limited testing or full scale production, understanding how their AI investment is performing and returning value is critical. That is because running and deploying AI applications is costly and hard to get right. NIM helps this, but often LLMs are a part of the overall application, so New Relic allows you to observe all parts of the application, both AI and non-AI portions. Our investment in NVIDIA NIM allows customers to extend observability to NVIDIAs microservices architecture.

Observability is uniquely suited to solving these challenges for business. This integration further reduces complexity and costs of developing, deploying, and monitoring AI applications. 

Customers can use New Relic AI monitoring to gain a comprehensive view of AI applications built with NVIDIA NIM, along with key metrics on throughput, latency, and costs while ensuring data privacy. 

I am proud that our team is always anticipating and solving for our customers' needs ahead of the market. And there is still so much more to come.

"May 22, 2024 was truly a monumental day for Dominion Energy.  This date marked the installation of the first monopile foundation with 170+ to follow through 2026 for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (CVOW).   These monopiles are nearly the height of the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument combined!

When completed, this wind facility will provide clean energy to 660,000 customers; thereby, eliminating millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. 

Thanks to all the project managers, engineers, technical and environmental specialists, supply chain, legal, accounting and many others who are dedicating their time to this project. 

Some companies talk about making a difference for the future, other companies take the bold steps to make it happen!

Proud to work at a company that takes bold steps to make our tomorrows cleaner and better!!!!

"Implement multi-touch attribution in Salesforce in less than 5 minutes?

Yup.

We've improved the time to install, implement, and backfill all your Salesforce Campaign data with Align.ly Attribution from several hours to just 5 minutes.

I've now personally done over 100 implementations of Align.ly Attribution and we've obsessed over removing every friction point in the implementation process.

In addition to a 5 minute implementation and backfilling all your data so you get immediate insights, we also offer a free trial. Compare that to a world where our competitors take 6-8 weeks to implement, simply say ""trust us"", and charge 10x the price.

Check out this short video where I do an Align.ly Attribution implementation from start-to-finish.",Product Development
