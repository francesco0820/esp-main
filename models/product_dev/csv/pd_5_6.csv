1) Kids receive a physical debit card (with ability add to a mobile wallet) along with their own Greenlight app with additional features and lessons
2) Parents have visibility and control of the accounts for their children all within their existing U.S. Bank mobile app

This is an awesome joint effort across U.S. Bank and Greenlight to develop the concept and deploy using the Greenlight SDK.

Thank you to the team with special thanks to Tara O'Donnell for her commitment to drive this effort to execution. Congratulations to the collective achievement of the teams – product, digital, technology, risk, marketing, legal, and many others to attack a need and deliver a solution.

What a cool way to introduce our most portable keyboard, Keys-To-Go 2. At the NYC event, we showcased how our various mobile solutions enable users to roam free anywhere like at a park, café, hotel and airport.

It was awesome connecting with my friends at Samsung and bringing my current and past worlds together… Keys-To-Go 2 with Samsung Galaxy devices and DeX!

We are delighted to share that the first European case for the Together Registry was recently completed by Dr. Antonio Bozzani and his team in Pavia, Italy.

The Together Registry is the latest real-world registry sponsored by Gore following the completion of the GREAT registry and aims to include up to 10,000 patients (including 3,500 patients in our abdominal module) treated with products in the GORE® EXCLUDER® Device family, as well as a collection of ten-year follow-up data on these patients.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertroley/,"Today we are announcing that we are the first observability platform to integrate with NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices). This announcement continues our strategy of extending our AI investment, and follows previous announcements of AI monitoring, New Relic (our GenAI Assistant), and AIOps.
 
Several organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI for a variety of use cases, and whether they are in experimentation, limited testing or full scale production, understanding how their AI investment is performing and returning value is critical. That is because running and deploying AI applications is costly and hard to get right. NIM helps this, but often LLMs are a part of the overall application, so New Relic allows you to observe all parts of the application, both AI and non-AI portions. Our investment in NVIDIA NIM allows customers to extend observability to NVIDIA’s microservices architecture.

Observability is uniquely suited to solving these challenges for business. This integration further reduces complexity and costs of developing, deploying, and monitoring AI applications. 

Customers can use New Relic AI monitoring to gain a comprehensive view of AI applications built with NVIDIA NIM, along with key metrics on throughput, latency, and costs while ensuring data privacy. 

I am proud that our team is always anticipating and solving for our customers' needs ahead of the market. And there is still so much more to come.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-f-green-6041758/,"May 22, 2024 was truly a monumental day for Dominion Energy.  This date marked the installation of the first monopile foundation with 170+ to follow through 2026 for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (CVOW).   These monopiles are nearly the height of the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument combined!

When completed, this wind facility will provide clean energy to 660,000 customers; thereby, eliminating millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. 

Thanks to all the project managers, engineers, technical and environmental specialists, supply chain, legal, accounting and many others who are dedicating their time to this project. 

Some companies talk about making a difference for the future, other companies take the bold steps to make it happen!

Proud to work at a company that takes bold steps to make our tomorrows cleaner and better!!!!

Yup.

We've improved the time to install, implement, and backfill all your Salesforce Campaign data with Align.ly Attribution from several hours to just 5 minutes.

I've now personally done over 100 implementations of Align.ly Attribution and we've obsessed over removing every friction point in the implementation process.

In addition to a 5 minute implementation and backfilling all your data so you get immediate insights, we also offer a free trial. Compare that to a world where our competitors take 6-8 weeks to implement, simply say ""trust us"", and charge 10x the price.
