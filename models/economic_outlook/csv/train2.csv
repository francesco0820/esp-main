"There's lots of talk about the expected shortage of healthcare workers in the United States.
The sources of this shortage are threefold:
1) need is growing because of the aging population;
2) many healthcare workers are leaving the workforce voluntarily or are retiring; and
3) we are not producing enough new healthcare workers to replace the ones who are leaving or retiring.
The projected US healthcare workforce shortage was anticipated as early as 15 years ago and has always struck me as odd. As a country, the United States has more healthcare workers per capita than most other like nations.
I am reminded that how we define a problem influences how we solve that problem""and I would argue that addressing our workforce shortage requires a much bigger reimagination than simply producing more of the same types of healthcare workers.
Some thoughts on solutions:
1) Unlock the latent skill of all healthcare professionals: many healthcare professions are defined by ""scope of practice"" rules that say what they can and can not do. We need to rethink who does what and in what situations. Pharmacists, for example, are a highly trained and empowered group of clinicians who can do more to help manage the burden of chronic disease than they are empowered to do. Instead, arcane laws and regulations hold back their impact.
2) Reimagine the healthcare team: much ""scope of practice"" dialog is about replacing one type of healthcare worker with another. Rather, we should be thinking about engineering true interprofessional teams that have robust supervision models, escalation protocols, and support so that outcomes and care are owned by groups of people whose collective capacity is greater than the sum of their individual capacity (1+1=3). This isn't about replacing doctors with nurse practioners (as it has been in so many settings) but positioning people to collaborate to ensure sound clinical care.
3) Eliminate useless, non-value added work and tasks: there is so much non-value added work in healthcare. Tons of it. There has been talk for 3 decades about eliminating that non-value added work""yet it continues to layer upon itself. Start with documentation. We are literally crushing ourselves underneath the burden of documentation and administrative exercises that are tangentially related to clinical care. Time to start calling it what it is.
4) Drive consumption of less healthcare: much healthcare that is consumed is not valuable for patients. We have an ""overuse"" problem in US healthcare wherein people are getting services that they don't necessarily need. We could free up a lot of clinical capacity if we began to commit to scaling back on the kinds of services that provide little real benefit to patients.

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for ""Bidenomics"". Unemployment hasn't been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Biden's team seems to have engineered the rare ""soft landing"" where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" "" the world's most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. America's greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Biden's leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on America's constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administration's policies. President Biden's appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook

"Normally, a better-than-expected jobs report is great news for commercial real estate demand. The news of 500,000 plus job additions in January, as well as record-low unemployment rates, should be no exception as far as long-term property fundamentals are concerned. However, this may prompt the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rate hikes for longer. Nonetheless, investors should keep two factors in mind:
1) The jobs report showed strength in lower-paying employment categories.
2) The effects of past interest rate hikes have yet to show up in slowing economic activity fully.
Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the Fed tightening cycle should be nearing its end in the coming months. For more information on January job growth and its potential impact on CRE, see the link below for our research department's latest perspective. #commercialrealestate #jobs

"The impact of stubborn inflation, rising interest rates, and recession concerns on commercial real estate continues to play out""the multifamily sector has been a top choice for over a decade, thanks to strong demographics and employment growth. However, this year multifamily real estate is facing some unusual setbacks. Historic performance during the pandemic and production delays in 2022 are driving new construction volumes to all-time highs amid waning renter demand. This combination is pushing vacancies up and slowing rent growth.
However, the long-term outlook is bolstered by still-positive demographics and barriers to homeownership. The interest rate shock that apartment investors are grappling with is also making homes far less affordable due to a record run in home prices over the last three years. Multifamily investors should also keep in mind that nearly 40% of new construction is concentrated in just 10 metros, which also happen to be among the job growth leaders so concerns for overbuilding at a macro level are likely overblown. Last, but certainly not least, apartment rents spiked 26% on average between 2019 and 2022, so a leveling-off phase is somewhat understandable. For a more comprehensive analysis, the Marcus & Millichap research team recently published its 2023 Multifamily Investment Outlook, which provides a detailed outlook for the U.S. multifamily sector in 2023, metrics and analyses for 50 markets across the country, and supply and demand forecasts for each metro.

"The future of work in America""the mass occupational shift in the labor market we've been anticipating""is no longer years or even months away. It's happening right now.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues reveal its potential to accelerate inclusive economic growth in their latest report. My top takeaway: The US economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs.
You can read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eBrcCbip
Some context: Between 2019 and 2022, the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts as people left jobs during the pandemic in areas like food services, in-person sales, and office support.
Today, generative AI is accelerating the scope and speed of automation. Activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours worked across the US economy could be automated by 2030. Jobs in food service, in-person sales, and office support could continue to decline.
But there is potential upside here.
We think generative AI could enhance the way people work in STEM, creative, and business/legal professions rather than eliminating jobs in those fields outright.
Federal investment addressing climate change will produce a net employment gain in green industries. Infrastructure projects will further increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today.
Finally, as the population ages, we see increased demand for healthcare workers, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce. What will it take to get this shift right? The report finds that part of the answer has to do with workforce development and upskilling on a massive scale. Another involves hiring approaches that focus on skills rather than credentials.
None of that will be easy. Accelerating inclusive growth requires courage among leaders and collaboration across industries and sectors. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say: I'm so inspired to get to work.

 Nearly two-thirds of small business owners expect their business revenue to increase in the year ahead. 

 Worries about inflation and interest rates have lessened since last Spring, while recession and supply chain concerns are down significantly. Costs of healthcare and commodity prices are still high on the list of small business owner worries. 

 Many owners are taking proactive steps to ensure the health and success of their businesses. Nearly 40% plan to expand this year, and over 70% plan to seek financing, building on strong revenues that were generally higher in 2023 than in 2022.

"In January 2016, Leeba Lessin offered me the opportunity to succeed her as the leader of CareMore Health. As part of the transition, she and I visited many of the company's markets and clinics. She wanted to say goodbye to as many people as she could, but (I realized after the fact) she also wanted to give me some final leadership tutoring as part of the transition. I will never forget our final visit to the Upland Care Center.
Moments after walking into the clinic, Leeba warmly greeted the receptionist and the gave her a big hug. The receptionist didn't waste the moment to ask for something that had been on her mind for awhile. She asked Leeba if they might be able to get a fish tank for the waiting room. She shared how much she and the patients would enjoy the calming effect of an aquarium.
""Sure!!!!"" Leeba said with booming, obvious enthusiasm. ""What a great idea!"" In the moment, she went ahead and emailed our facilities leader and asked him to have a fish tank installed that week.
I was a little bit shocked (and as a lifetime aquarium hobbyist, excited). I was used to leaders doing a bit of what my parents did when I asked for a new toy saying something like, ""I'll think about it."" I was also used to leaders instinctively hiding behind cost management. But Leeba not only made a quick decision""she set in motion fulfilling the request. Leeba noticed the suprise on my face.
In that moment, she pulled me aside and whispered an important leadership lesson: Saying yes to a modest request like ""can we have a fish tank,"" is the fastest way to make people believe that they matter and one of the fastest ways to foster a culture of ownership and empowerment and belonging. The fish tank arrived later that week and Leeba and I were treated to a picture of the staff with the tank. It was a very small gesture, but it was clearly huge to the employees of that clinic.
A finance or accounting mindset in that moment would have led to a careful evaluation of the cost of the fish tank and the monthly maintenance and effect on run rate. An operations or risk management mindset would have led to an assessment of whether if we did it for one clinic we needed to do it for all clinics. And in both approaches, the answer would have been ""no fish tank."" But what Leeba taught me was that a leadership mindset leads to an instinctive ""yes,"" and quick action on what was (in the grand scheme of things) a very small request.
Since that time I've said yes to many metaphorical ""fish tanks"" where I might otherwise have said ""no"" or ""maybe"" or ""later"" or ""it depends."" And I have to say, it does feel really good to deliver an enthusiastic, unmitigated ""yes!"" from time to time.
As many of you know, Leeba Lessin passed away a little bit more than two years ago. But I'm reminded of the pearls of wisdom she shared along the way and relish in how lucky I was to learn from one of the true greats.

In the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity's (LISEP) third quarter True Weekly Earnings report, wages are positive "" but barely. For the lowest wage earners, the gain was 0.3%, or about $2 a week. We are now in a string of seven consecutive quarters with a BLS-reported unemployment rate of less than 4%.

Take a listen!
We all know military life can present challenges for a family. Having to constantly move from one city to another, can lead to child care issues, as well as trouble for the military spouse to find a job in a new location. Way above the national average, military spouses register an unemployment rate of more than 20%. Since 2009, an organization called, ""Blue Star Families"" has tried to help military families navigate the challenges they will undoubtedly face. The Co-Founder and CEO of Blue Star Families, Kathy Roth-Douquet, recently talked with the Federal Drive with Tom Temin Executive Producer Eric White.

"Surprising most analysts and forecasters, employers added a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, according to this morning's monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was almost twice the growth from December's 260,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.
What does this mean?
It may mean very little. The Bureau of Labor Statistics's monthly report can bounce around a lot, depending on seasonal weights and samples. Next month's job number could be far lower.
Also, keep your eye on wage growth. Average hourly earnings climbed in January at a slower pace than in December "" by an annualized 4.4 percent, down from 4.8 percent in December. With prices still rising faster than wages, most workers continue to suffer a decline in their real wage "" that is, in their purchasing power.
But the strength of the labor market is likely to worry the Fed, which last Wednesday raised interest rates for the eighth time in a year "" although only by a quarter of a percentage point this time.
""The labor market continues to be out of balance,"" Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said earlier this week. He stressed that we won't have a return to his target 2 percent inflation in the service sector ""without a better balance in the labor market,"" adding ""I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment.""
As I've said many times over the past year, this worry is misplaced. Most of the upward pressure on prices domestically is coming from big corporations with the market power to raise prices faster than their costs are rising. Much of the rest is coming from continuing supply shocks abroad, including Putin's war's effects on global energy and food prices, and China's lockdowns followed by COVID.
And, as today's report shows, wage gains are slowing and they lag behind price increases.
The basic reality is American workers don't have the power to raise their wages. Big American corporations have the power to raise their prices. The Fed should not be aiming to increase unemployment as a means of slowing prices.",Economic Outlook

One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sector""even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010""it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets won't be easy, especially amid today's headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continent""and the global economy""thrive.

We've been running this research for 9 years, where we speak to thousands of leaders across a vast array of territories and industry groups. Results typically vary from one region to the next, but this year, there was greater consistency across regions and sectors.

But despite it all, confidence in the wider economy is broadly positive "" echoing my own view that better market conditions are on the horizon even as we face numerous obstacles.

LISEP's TRU, a measure of the ""functionally unemployed"" "" defined as the jobless, plus those seeking, but unable to find, full-time employment paying above the poverty line after adjusting for inflation "" dropped 0.7 percentage points for the month of May, improving to 22.4%. By contrast, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported an increase in the official jobless rate, from 3.4% to 3.7%. This is primarily due to the loss of low-wage part-time workers, counted as ""employed"" by the BLS "" but classified as ""functionally unemployed"" by LISEP in previous monthly reports.
This month is a perfect example of the shortcomings of government headline statistics in assessing the status of the economy. The loss of low-wage, part-time jobs should come as no surprise, and in fact, jobs incapable of lifting workers out of poverty should not even be considered employment for the purpose of setting economic policy.
