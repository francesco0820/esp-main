"I am humbled and honored to assume the role of President of the IFPMA (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations).
This important organization consists of more than 90 pharmaceutical companies and associations and works closely with the United Nations to advance global health through discovering, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines. This talented group of colleagues is as passionate as I am about improving the lives of people everywhere.
If there is one thing that the past three years taught us, it is that nothing is impossible. I believe the things we accomplished during that period are just the start of a scientific renaissance, one in which previously unimaginable therapies and medicines can be discovered, developed, and delivered to patients more quickly than ever before. Over the coming decades, all of us in the life sciences sector hope to deliver game-changing innovations to address some of the world's most devastating diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological and muscular disorders.
That is what excites me the most about the presidency of the IFPMA: it is an unparalleled opportunity to make real, lasting and positive changes in the field of healthcare""so that the health issues that vex us today will be ancient history for our children and grandchildren. Thank you to my predecessor Jean-Christophe Tellier, who has accomplished so many great things over the past two and a half years, and to Thomas Cueni, for making this transition so smooth and seamless.

"Last week's #inflation data revealed the 12th consecutive month of declining headline #CPI, reaching 3% in June. This marks a 100-basis point decrease from May and a 610-basis point decrease from a year ago. Despite this, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to raise rates due to the persistence of high core inflation (excluding food and energy) at 4.8%. Although progress is being made in combating inflation without significant damage to the economy, the core inflation rate and low unemployment indicate the unlikelihood of the Fed reducing interest rates soon. The current cycle differs from previous market disruptions, as it relies on the acceptance of normalized interest rates and realistic valuations to drive recovery in transaction and financing flows. However, this process is already underway, with expectations being reset.",Economic Outlook,1,1

"The #jobs report from last week painted a picture of both growth and slowing in the labor market. Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates. The path to normalized trading and financing activity in the market hinges on acknowledging realistic valuations and accepting that interest rates won't be decreasing anytime soon.",Economic Outlook,1,1

Record attendance among the largest and most active muti-family owners, investors and lenders is indicative of the demand for information, direction and perspective. Although all of us acknowledge the near-term challenges in valuations, availability of financing and economic outlook, the shortage of housing, the wide gap between the cost of owning a home vs. renting and expected pullback in new construction all support a positive long-term view on apartment investments. The bid-ask spread is gradually narrowing but remains elevated and financing will likely remain restricted with rates remaining volatile in the foreseeable future. The end to the tightening cycle should be near and its emergence should bring some stability to the rate environment. That, coupled with the wall of capital waiting to re-enter the market will fuel recovery in trading volumes. Given the ""higher for longer"" outlook on rates, the normalization of trading will likely take more time.",Economic Outlook,1,1

"Patients are the reason we do what we do. They're our ""why."" That is why I look forward to our #PatientsinFocus Week every year. This weeklong series of events gives us the opportunity to hear directly from our patients and patient advocates, and to discuss the issues that are important to them. This year's theme is, ""All In for All Patients,"" reinforcing our belief that healthcare progress is only achieved when patients are at the center of our work.
To kick things off, my colleague Mikael Dolsten and I recently sat down with Beth Battaglino, President and CEO of HealthyWomen.org, and more than 240 global patient advocates for a fireside chat. We covered several topics, but two that were particularly important to me are captured below:
- We measure our success at Pfizer not only through financial metrics, but also by how many patients we have impacted each month, each quarter, and each year. We report on our patient impact every quarter to remind ourselves of the important work we do.
- There is a significant health equity gap in our world, and we view it as our responsibility to help close that gap.
A big thank you to Beth for moderating this discussion, to my #PFEcolleagues for organizing this important event week, and most of all, to our patients, advocates and caregivers, who graciously agreed to share their time, questions, and experiences with us this week. #PfizerProud
