"I am humbled and honored to assume the role of President of the IFPMA (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations).
This important organization consists of more than 90 pharmaceutical companies and associations and works closely with the United Nations to advance global health through discovering, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines. This talented group of colleagues is as passionate as I am about improving the lives of people everywhere.
If there is one thing that the past three years taught us, it is that nothing is impossible. I believe the things we accomplished during that period are just the start of a scientific renaissance, one in which previously unimaginable therapies and medicines can be discovered, developed, and delivered to patients more quickly than ever before. Over the coming decades, all of us in the life sciences sector hope to deliver game-changing innovations to address some of the world's most devastating diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological and muscular disorders.
That is what excites me the most about the presidency of the IFPMA: it is an unparalleled opportunity to make real, lasting and positive changes in the field of healthcare""so that the health issues that vex us today will be ancient history for our children and grandchildren. Thank you to my predecessor Jean-Christophe Tellier, who has accomplished so many great things over the past two and a half years, and to Thomas Cueni, for making this transition so smooth and seamless.

"Patients are the reason we do what we do. They're our ""why."" That is why I look forward to our #PatientsinFocus Week every year. This weeklong series of events gives us the opportunity to hear directly from our patients and patient advocates, and to discuss the issues that are important to them. This year's theme is, ""All In for All Patients,"" reinforcing our belief that healthcare progress is only achieved when patients are at the center of our work.
To kick things off, my colleague Mikael Dolsten and I recently sat down with Beth Battaglino, President and CEO of HealthyWomen.org, and more than 240 global patient advocates for a fireside chat. We covered several topics, but two that were particularly important to me are captured below:
- We measure our success at Pfizer not only through financial metrics, but also by how many patients we have impacted each month, each quarter, and each year. We report on our patient impact every quarter to remind ourselves of the important work we do.
- There is a significant health equity gap in our world, and we view it as our responsibility to help close that gap.
A big thank you to Beth for moderating this discussion, to my #PFEcolleagues for organizing this important event week, and most of all, to our patients, advocates and caregivers, who graciously agreed to share their time, questions, and experiences with us this week. #PfizerProud

"As the top self-storage property broker in the United States, Marcus & Millichap"" s real-time market insights and research align well with the key data points outlined in a recent The Wall Street Journal article. The article underscores the persistent demand for storage units. The current cycle is propelled by substantial societal shifts, including a rental surge precipitated by the pandemic, the subsequent economic resilience and increased mobility in the post-pandemic landscape. Furthermore, the robust employment market continues to drive the utilization of storage facilities. A measure of market softening is foreseen due to the resurgence of new development pipelines; however, over the long term, evolving demographics and a resilient economic outlook point to a compelling investment outlook for the storage sector. Our team is reporting emerging indications of price adjustments contingent on quality and location. Notwithstanding, self-storage investments have demonstrated a notable degree of resilience compared to other segments within the property market. https://lnkd.in/e8iGCc-r",Economic Outlook
