"When I was in Damascus with international NGOs last week several themes emerged, but one struck me the most: frustration when donors ask to differentiate between earthquake and conflict-related damage. Regardless of how the damage was caused, those who stayed are suffering from a host of issuesâ€”poor economy and lack of basic services, in addition to the ongoing conflictâ€”while living amidst rubble. I was heartened to meet with community members who have taken on incredible leadership roles to support their neighbors and was inspired by the resilient people I met along the way. The stories I heard painted a poignant picture of lives shattered by war, yet still driven by hope for a better future. The international community needs to do more and we canâ€™t neglect the people of Syria.",Economic Outlook

"KPMG just released our latest edition of #CEOoutlook, and it was great to speak to Forbes about this year's findings. I encourage you to take a look as I was struck by how the stats tell one of the clearest stories yet.
Weâ€™ve been running this research for 9 years, where we speak to thousands of leaders across a vast array of territories and industry groups. Results typically vary from one region to the next, but this year, there was greater consistency across regions and sectors.
From a shifting geopolitical landscape to AI and ESG â€“ executives are juggling with a raft of new opportunities and threats â€“ on top of the day-to-day challenge of balancing the books during a period of economic unease. But despite it all, confidence in the wider economy is broadly positive â€“ echoing my own view that better market conditions are on the horizon even as we face numerous obstacles.
The key to success will be a relentless focus on long-term, strategic planning that avoids the danger of reactive decisions limited by a narrow short-term horizon. Thatâ€™s certainly been the case at KPMG as weâ€™ve regularly had to update our strategy and reaffirm our commitment to it.
2020, 2021, 2022, 2023â€¦ Each year unpredictable, each year creating a new norm. Itâ€™s impossible to believe that any five-year plan has been left untouched. Yet businesses are moving forward, learning new ways to build resilience, and focusing on the bigger picture.
Iâ€™ll leave you with my favorite statistic in this report: 69% of CEOs have now fully embedded ESG into their businesses as a means to value creation. Itâ€™s a very encouraging finding and if the KPMG 2023 CEO Outlook tells us anything, itâ€™s that leaders are prepared and ready to do what it takes to build a more sustainable world that benefits every one of us.",Economic Outlook
"The future of work in Americaâ€”the mass occupational shift in the labor market weâ€™ve been anticipatingâ€”is no longer years or even months away. Itâ€™s happening right now.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues reveal its potential to accelerate inclusive economic growth in their latest report. My top takeaway: The US economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs.
You can read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eBrcCbip
Some context: Between 2019 and 2022, the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts as people left jobs during the pandemic in areas like food services, in-person sales, and office support.
Today, generative AI is accelerating the scope and speed of automation. Activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours worked across the US economy could be automated by 2030. Jobs in food service, in-person sales, and office support could continue to decline.
But there is potential upside here.
We think generative AI could enhance the way people work in STEM, creative, and business/legal professions rather than eliminating jobs in those fields outright.
Federal investment addressing climate change will produce a net employment gain in green industries. Infrastructure projects will further increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today.
Finally, as the population ages, we see increased demand for healthcare workers, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce. What will it take to get this shift right? The report finds that part of the answer has to do with workforce development and upskilling on a massive scale. Another involves hiring approaches that focus on skills rather than credentials.
None of that will be easy. Accelerating inclusive growth requires courage among leaders and collaboration across industries and sectors. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say: Iâ€™m so inspired to get to work.

"The world needs Africa to thrive. Home to the youngest and fastest-growing population on Earth, the continent will play a critical role in our ability to make the transition to net zero and lessen the emerging impact of demographic decline.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have just published a new report on Africa. They describe it as a â€œclarion call for sustainable, inclusive growth.â€ It takes a granular look at Africaâ€™s economic performance, highlighting successes across its countries, cities, and companies.
You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/gmBdRT7K
The report finds that Africaâ€™s growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But thereâ€™s no â€˜one Africa.â€™ Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from whatâ€™s working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sectorâ€”even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010â€”it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets wonâ€™t be easy, especially amid todayâ€™s headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continentâ€”and the global economyâ€”thrive.

And since the best way to build generational wealth is through home ownership, the inability to even purchase that first starter home only exacerbates wealth inequality.

"The percentage of Americans with living-wage jobs improved significantly from April to May, with â€œfunctional unemploymentâ€ dropping to its lowest level in months for all major demographic groups, according to the monthly True Rate of Unemployment report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.
LISEPâ€™s TRU, a measure of the â€œfunctionally unemployedâ€ â€“ defined as the jobless, plus those seeking, but unable to find, full-time employment paying above the poverty line after adjusting for inflation â€“ dropped 0.7 percentage points for the month of May, improving to 22.4%. By contrast, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported an increase in the official jobless rate, from 3.4% to 3.7%. This is primarily due to the loss of low-wage part-time workers, counted as â€œemployedâ€ by the BLS â€“ but classified as â€œfunctionally unemployedâ€ by LISEP in previous monthly reports.
This month is a perfect example of the shortcomings of government headline statistics in assessing the status of the economy. The loss of low-wage, part-time jobs should come as no surprise, and in fact, jobs incapable of lifting workers out of poverty should not even be considered employment for the purpose of setting economic policy.

The news of 500,000 plus job additions in January, as well as record-low unemployment rates, should be no exception as far as long-term property fundamentals are concerned. However, this may prompt the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rate hikes for longer. Nonetheless, investors should keep two factors in mind:
1) The jobs report showed strength in lower-paying employment categories.
2) The effects of past interest rate hikes have yet to show up in slowing economic activity fully.
Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the Fed tightening cycle should be nearing its end in the coming months. For more information on January job growth and its potential impact on CRE, see the link below for our research department's latest perspective. #commercialrealestate #jobs

Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates.

The bid-ask spread is gradually narrowing but remains elevated and financing will likely remain restricted with rates remaining volatile in the foreseeable future. The end to the tightening cycle should be near and its emergence should bring some stability to the rate environment.

"The U.S. economy added 187,000 jobs in July â€“ the most modest gains since late 2020. Job growth appears to be normalizing while strong wage growth and a steadily low unemployment rate illustrate the labor market's resiliency. The gap between job openings and available talent remains significant at nearly 1.6 jobs for every available worker. And while the labor participation rate remains steady at 62.6%, it's still below the 63.3% last seen in February 2020. This persistent imbalance requires creative approaches to skill acquisition through a combination of upskilling, reskilling and outside talent.

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for â€œBidenomicsâ€. Unemployment hasnâ€™t been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Bidenâ€™s team seems to have engineered the rare â€œsoft landingâ€ where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" â€” the worldâ€™s most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. Americaâ€™s greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Bidenâ€™s leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on Americaâ€™s constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putinâ€™s brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administrationâ€™s policies. President Bidenâ€™s appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook
"If you havenâ€™t received the news about the American economy being in surprisingly good shape by most metrics, youâ€™re not alone. Good economic news doesnâ€™t make it through the negative sludge of Fox News or Newsmax. It barely gets through the mainstream media. Is that why many Americans are pessimistic about our economic outlook? Or is there something deeper at play?",Economic Outlook
"Surprising most analysts and forecasters, employers added a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, according to this morningâ€™s monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was almost twice the growth from Decemberâ€™s 260,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.
What does this mean?
It may mean very little. The Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™s monthly report can bounce around a lot, depending on seasonal weights and samples. Next monthâ€™s job number could be far lower.
Also, keep your eye on wage growth. Average hourly earnings climbed in January at a slower pace than in December â€” by an annualized 4.4 percent, down from 4.8 percent in December. With prices still rising faster than wages, most workers continue to suffer a decline in their real wage â€“ that is, in their purchasing power.
But the strength of the labor market is likely to worry the Fed, which last Wednesday raised interest rates for the eighth time in a year â€“ although only by a quarter of a percentage point this time.
â€œThe labor market continues to be out of balance,â€ Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said earlier this week. He stressed that we wonâ€™t have a return to his target 2 percent inflation in the service sector â€œwithout a better balance in the labor market,â€ adding â€œI donâ€™t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment.â€
As Iâ€™ve said many times over the past year, this worry is misplaced. Most of the upward pressure on prices domestically is coming from big corporations with the market power to raise prices faster than their costs are rising. Much of the rest is coming from continuing supply shocks abroad, including Putinâ€™s warâ€™s effects on global energy and food prices, and Chinaâ€™s lockdowns followed by COVID.
And, as todayâ€™s report shows, wage gains are slowing and they lag behind price increases.
The basic reality is American workers donâ€™t have the power to raise their wages. Big American corporations have the power to raise their prices. The Fed should not be aiming to increase unemployment as a means of slowing prices.",Economic Outlook
