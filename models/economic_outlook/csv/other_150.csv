"Today, December 5, 2023, marks Algorics's 10th anniversary.
A decade ago, what commenced as an individual's vision has now evolved into a thriving reality. This milestone is not merely a celebration of the company's achievements but a testament to the collective efforts of our remarkable team and supporters.
Reflecting on the journey that has brought us to this significant juncture, our early days from 2013 to 2018 were laden with challenges, ranging from securing funding, building a reliable team, and designing the product from the ground up. All this while navigating a competitive market and culminating in an eventual asset sale. Despite the daunting obstacles, this period forged the resilience and innovative spirit that laid the foundation for version 2.0, initiated in 2020, defining the company as a fast-growing, innovative data science CRO.
As we expanded, so did our team and network of supportersâ€”organically and through acquisitions such as MetaVate and DCDS. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to every employee who joined us along the way. Your dedication, creativity, and hard work are the backbone of our success.
At the core of everything we do are our clients and customers. I am forever grateful to the early believersâ€”our initial customers and investors who saw potential in our vision and paved the way for our current successes. Every client we have supported has shaped our products and services through continuous feedback, loyalty, and engagement.
The journey ahead continues to be promising, and our commitment to innovation and excellence remains unwavering. I want to express my profound appreciation to everyone who has been part of our journey. Your support, in its many forms, has been the lifeblood of Algorics.
Here's to the next decade of growth, innovation, and shared success!",MISC
"I am humbled and honored to assume the role of President of the IFPMA (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations).
This important organization consists of more than 90 pharmaceutical companies and associations and works closely with the United Nations to advance global health through discovering, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines. This talented group of colleagues is as passionate as I am about improving the lives of people everywhere.
If there is one thing that the past three years taught us, it is that nothing is impossible. I believe the things we accomplished during that period are just the start of a scientific renaissance, one in which previously unimaginable therapies and medicines can be discovered, developed, and delivered to patients more quickly than ever before. Over the coming decades, all of us in the life sciences sector hope to deliver game-changing innovations to address some of the worldâ€™s most devastating diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological and muscular disorders.
That is what excites me the most about the presidency of the IFPMA: it is an unparalleled opportunity to make real, lasting and positive changes in the field of healthcareâ€”so that the health issues that vex us today will be ancient history for our children and grandchildren. Thank you to my predecessor Jean-Christophe Tellier, who has accomplished so many great things over the past two and a half years, and to Thomas Cueni, for making this transition so smooth and seamless.

"Reading about Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics can be dull to some folks. I get it. I truly do. But getting started on an ESG journey is so worth it. The benefits of collecting and analyzing data and establishing a baseline reveal opportunities to reduce cost AND create long-term value.
As a CFO, I enjoy reading stories like this from Liberty Tire Recycling, LLC. Over the company's 16-month #ESG journey, they experienced humbling revelations.
""When we shifted to looking through an ESG lens, we noticed that maybe we're a little more of a brown organization with a green story."" Among other lessons: buy-in from the top makes it easier to demonstrate the value across the organization. I love Amy Brackin's insights, and I couldn't agree more.

"In January 2016, Leeba Lessin offered me the opportunity to succeed her as the leader of CareMore Health. As part of the transition, she and I visited many of the companyâ€™s markets and clinics. She wanted to say goodbye to as many people as she could, but (I realized after the fact) she also wanted to give me some final leadership tutoring as part of the transition. I will never forget our final visit to the Upland Care Center.
Moments after walking into the clinic, Leeba warmly greeted the receptionist and the gave her a big hug. The receptionist didnâ€™t waste the moment to ask for something that had been on her mind for awhile. She asked Leeba if they might be able to get a fish tank for the waiting room. She shared how much she and the patients would enjoy the calming effect of an aquarium.
â€œSure!!!!â€ Leeba said with booming, obvious enthusiasm. â€œWhat a great idea!â€ In the moment, she went ahead and emailed our facilities leader and asked him to have a fish tank installed that week.
I was a little bit shocked (and as a lifetime aquarium hobbyist, excited). I was used to leaders doing a bit of what my parents did when I asked for a new toy saying something like, â€œIâ€™ll think about it.â€ I was also used to leaders instinctively hiding behind cost management. But Leeba not only made a quick decisionâ€”she set in motion fulfilling the request. Leeba noticed the suprise on my face.
In that moment, she pulled me aside and whispered an important leadership lesson: Saying yes to a modest request like â€œcan we have a fish tank,â€ is the fastest way to make people believe that they matter and one of the fastest ways to foster a culture of ownership and empowerment and belonging. The fish tank arrived later that week and Leeba and I were treated to a picture of the staff with the tank. It was a very small gesture, but it was clearly huge to the employees of that clinic.
A finance or accounting mindset in that moment would have led to a careful evaluation of the cost of the fish tank and the monthly maintenance and effect on run rate. An operations or risk management mindset would have led to an assessment of whether if we did it for one clinic we needed to do it for all clinics. And in both approaches, the answer would have been â€œno fish tank.â€ But what Leeba taught me was that a leadership mindset leads to an instinctive â€œyes,â€ and quick action on what was (in the grand scheme of things) a very small request.
Since that time Iâ€™ve said yes to many metaphorical â€œfish tanksâ€ where I might otherwise have said â€œnoâ€ or â€œmaybeâ€ or â€œlaterâ€ or â€œit depends.â€ And I have to say, it does feel really good to deliver an enthusiastic, unmitigated â€œyes!â€ from time to time.
As many of you know, Leeba Lessin passed away a little bit more than two years ago. But Iâ€™m reminded of the pearls of wisdom she shared along the way and relish in how lucky I was to learn from one of the true greats.

"#Construction is a bellwether industry where the effects of a recession can be felt earlier than in other sectors. Many of AvidXchange, Inc.'s customers are contractors and subcontractors, and they are wise to be on alert for a potential downturn that could slow down work in their markets. That said, none of us know or can influence what's going to happen. Rather than focusing on hypotheticals, I'm encouraging our customers to focus on what they can control. What changes can they make in their businesses to reduce costs and increase efficiency? What changes would make their overhead and business model more competitive? Automating office operations is always a good place to start, and AvidXchange is an absolute game-changer for so many companies. Why wait for a recession?

This yearâ€™s theme is, â€œAll In for All Patients,â€ reinforcing our belief that healthcare progress is only achieved when patients are at the center of our work.
To kick things off, my colleague Mikael Dolsten and I recently sat down with Beth Battaglino, President and CEO of HealthyWomen.org, and more than 240 global patient advocates for a fireside chat. We covered several topics, but two that were particularly important to me are captured below:
- We measure our success at Pfizer not only through financial metrics, but also by how many patients we have impacted each month, each quarter, and each year. We report on our patient impact every quarter to remind ourselves of the important work we do.
- There is a significant health equity gap in our world, and we view it as our responsibility to help close that gap.
A big thank you to Beth for moderating this discussion, to my #PFEcolleagues for organizing this important event week, and most of all, to our patients, advocates and caregivers, who graciously agreed to share their time, questions, and experiences with us this week. #PfizerProud

"Iâ€™m proud to share that Independence Blue Cross is working with Carallel to provide extra support to caregivers.
When someone returns home from the hospital in a new state of â€œnormal,â€ their loved ones often have to adapt to unfamiliar challenges and responsibilities.

Now, caregivers of #IBX Medicare Advantage plan members discharged from the hospital will have access to a variety of supports, including expert advice, practical assistance, planning resources, support groups, and more.
Iâ€™m looking forward to the ways this will make a positive difference for caregivers and patients alike!
