"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for ""Bidenomics"". Unemployment hasn't been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Biden's team seems to have engineered the rare ""soft landing"" where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" "" the world's most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. America's greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Biden's leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on America's constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administration's policies. President Biden's appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook

"The future of work in America""the mass occupational shift in the labor market we've been anticipating""is no longer years or even months away. It's happening right now.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues reveal its potential to accelerate inclusive economic growth in their latest report. My top takeaway: The US economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs.
You can read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eBrcCbip
Some context: Between 2019 and 2022, the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts as people left jobs during the pandemic in areas like food services, in-person sales, and office support.
Today, generative AI is accelerating the scope and speed of automation. Activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours worked across the US economy could be automated by 2030. Jobs in food service, in-person sales, and office support could continue to decline.
But there is potential upside here.
We think generative AI could enhance the way people work in STEM, creative, and business/legal professions rather than eliminating jobs in those fields outright.
Federal investment addressing climate change will produce a net employment gain in green industries. Infrastructure projects will further increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today.
Finally, as the population ages, we see increased demand for healthcare workers, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce. What will it take to get this shift right? The report finds that part of the answer has to do with workforce development and upskilling on a massive scale. Another involves hiring approaches that focus on skills rather than credentials.
None of that will be easy. Accelerating inclusive growth requires courage among leaders and collaboration across industries and sectors. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say: I'm so inspired to get to work.

"In January 2016, Leeba Lessin offered me the opportunity to succeed her as the leader of CareMore Health. As part of the transition, she and I visited many of the company's markets and clinics. She wanted to say goodbye to as many people as she could, but (I realized after the fact) she also wanted to give me some final leadership tutoring as part of the transition. I will never forget our final visit to the Upland Care Center.
Moments after walking into the clinic, Leeba warmly greeted the receptionist and the gave her a big hug. The receptionist didn't waste the moment to ask for something that had been on her mind for awhile. She asked Leeba if they might be able to get a fish tank for the waiting room. She shared how much she and the patients would enjoy the calming effect of an aquarium.
""Sure!!!!"" Leeba said with booming, obvious enthusiasm. ""What a great idea!"" In the moment, she went ahead and emailed our facilities leader and asked him to have a fish tank installed that week.
I was a little bit shocked (and as a lifetime aquarium hobbyist, excited). I was used to leaders doing a bit of what my parents did when I asked for a new toy saying something like, ""I'll think about it."" I was also used to leaders instinctively hiding behind cost management. But Leeba not only made a quick decision""she set in motion fulfilling the request. Leeba noticed the suprise on my face.
In that moment, she pulled me aside and whispered an important leadership lesson: Saying yes to a modest request like ""can we have a fish tank,"" is the fastest way to make people believe that they matter and one of the fastest ways to foster a culture of ownership and empowerment and belonging. The fish tank arrived later that week and Leeba and I were treated to a picture of the staff with the tank. It was a very small gesture, but it was clearly huge to the employees of that clinic.
A finance or accounting mindset in that moment would have led to a careful evaluation of the cost of the fish tank and the monthly maintenance and effect on run rate. An operations or risk management mindset would have led to an assessment of whether if we did it for one clinic we needed to do it for all clinics. And in both approaches, the answer would have been ""no fish tank."" But what Leeba taught me was that a leadership mindset leads to an instinctive ""yes,"" and quick action on what was (in the grand scheme of things) a very small request.
Since that time I've said yes to many metaphorical ""fish tanks"" where I might otherwise have said ""no"" or ""maybe"" or ""later"" or ""it depends."" And I have to say, it does feel really good to deliver an enthusiastic, unmitigated ""yes!"" from time to time.
As many of you know, Leeba Lessin passed away a little bit more than two years ago. But I'm reminded of the pearls of wisdom she shared along the way and relish in how lucky I was to learn from one of the true greats.

"The percentage of Americans with living-wage jobs improved significantly from April to May, with ""functional unemployment"" dropping to its lowest level in months for all major demographic groups, according to the monthly True Rate of Unemployment report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.
LISEP's TRU, a measure of the ""functionally unemployed"" "" defined as the jobless, plus those seeking, but unable to find, full-time employment paying above the poverty line after adjusting for inflation "" dropped 0.7 percentage points for the month of May, improving to 22.4%. By contrast, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported an increase in the official jobless rate, from 3.4% to 3.7%. This is primarily due to the loss of low-wage part-time workers, counted as ""employed"" by the BLS "" but classified as ""functionally unemployed"" by LISEP in previous monthly reports.
This month is a perfect example of the shortcomings of government headline statistics in assessing the status of the economy. The loss of low-wage, part-time jobs should come as no surprise, and in fact, jobs incapable of lifting workers out of poverty should not even be considered employment for the purpose of setting economic policy.

"Surprising most analysts and forecasters, employers added a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, according to this morning's monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was almost twice the growth from December's 260,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.
What does this mean?
It may mean very little. The Bureau of Labor Statistics's monthly report can bounce around a lot, depending on seasonal weights and samples. Next month's job number could be far lower.
Also, keep your eye on wage growth. Average hourly earnings climbed in January at a slower pace than in December "" by an annualized 4.4 percent, down from 4.8 percent in December. With prices still rising faster than wages, most workers continue to suffer a decline in their real wage "" that is, in their purchasing power.
But the strength of the labor market is likely to worry the Fed, which last Wednesday raised interest rates for the eighth time in a year "" although only by a quarter of a percentage point this time.
""The labor market continues to be out of balance,"" Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said earlier this week. He stressed that we won't have a return to his target 2 percent inflation in the service sector ""without a better balance in the labor market,"" adding ""I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment.""
As I've said many times over the past year, this worry is misplaced. Most of the upward pressure on prices domestically is coming from big corporations with the market power to raise prices faster than their costs are rising. Much of the rest is coming from continuing supply shocks abroad, including Putin's war's effects on global energy and food prices, and China's lockdowns followed by COVID.
And, as today's report shows, wage gains are slowing and they lag behind price increases.
The basic reality is American workers don't have the power to raise their wages. Big American corporations have the power to raise their prices. The Fed should not be aiming to increase unemployment as a means of slowing prices.",Economic Outlook
