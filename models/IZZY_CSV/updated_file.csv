Being a patient is hard.  Providing care is hard. 

Neither should be, but when we couple rapid fire scientific breakthroughs with ever more complex healthcare systems and insurance benefit design, we turn what should be the most humane, compassionate industry out there into a source of frustration. Unintentionally, we compound the suffering caused by illness with the suffering caused by an incomprehensible healthcare ecosystem.  Good people and good care can help the former, but we need to fix our system to help the latter.  We need to streamline complexity and simplify health. 

Focusing on the basics is the right place to start.  For patients, that means being able to find care, access care, and navigate care.  My favorite slide for this week is all about finding care.  Back when I started in practice, patients found the right doctor to help them by referrals from family, friends, or another clinician.  Last year for the first time, our Press Ganey data showed the #1 way patients found care was on-line. 

My doctor friends, this means making sure your on-line profile and presence reflects who you are and what you do.  For patients to find you, you need to make sure your story is out there.  And reviews count.  A lot.  Patients won't see docs rated less than 4 stars.  Make sure all those patients that love you review you, not just the few that are unhappy. 

My health plan and health system friends - focus on that digital front door.  Those provider directories really matter. Patients count on those lists of affiliated/participating clinicians, including the phone numbers and addresses.  It's amazing how often those are out of date or simply wrong. And help docs get reviews on line.  The more reviews each provider has, the more trustworthy the data they convey. 

Helping patients find, access, and navigate the care they need is simple to describe but hard to execute; ensuring patients can easily find the care they need is step one.   Don't our patients deserve that?

Scott, Kansas. 

The good news.Â We are more than halfway, having biked more than 1750 of the 3041 miles. 

Tuesday night into Wednesday morning was a low point.Â After making great progress, we faced brutal conditions in western Kansasâ€”rain and strong, 20-30 mile headwinds.Â For bikers, headwinds are a weight both physically and mentally.Â It is like running with a 40-point backpack strapped to your back.Â A tough uphill eventually ends; headwinds can last for days.Â When I went to sleep Tuesday night, I had real doubts about whether we could make it.Â We were exhausted and feeling down.Â Tempers were short.Â Several other Race Across America racers and teams dropped out in Kansas, defeated by the wind. 

After 20 or so hours of difficult conditions, miraculously, the weather cooled, the winds stopped and a giant Midwest storm capable of tornadoes passed in front of us. 

Our crew of Tim, Jack (17), and Tucker (15) Punke, and I, took over our shift at around 1 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon about 100 miles west of Wichita, Kansas, and rode around 225 miles toward the Missouri border.Â The ride was glorious with one exception - a flat tire.Â Since we could not stop, for the first time in my life, I changed a tire in the back seat, enabling me to take a last shift at 3:30 a.m.Â We rolled into a $57 per night roadside at 5:30 a.m.Â A 17-hour shift was long, but it was a beautiful, moonlit night with relatively cool weather. While Tim was out on a long shift, we all stopped at Subway for a sandwich, the best meal we have had since starting.Â For the rest of the time, we have lived on salami and cheese on tortillas, bars, and energy gel.Â We slept from 6-10 a.m. and then hit the road again, meeting up with the crew which is currently biking toward Jefferson City, Missouri.

We face two major challenges going forward, in addition to exhaustion: hills and heat. As we move into Missouri, we go deeper and deeper into the heat dome that has built over the eastern United States.Â Humidity will exceed 90%.Â We are using ""ice socks""â€”pantyhose filled with ice that we ride with stuffed into our bike shirts.Â One might intuitively conclude that the major elevation gains lie in the westâ€”the southern Sierras, the climb out of the desert to Flagstaff, and the Rocky Mountains.Â As we enter eastern Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio, we will face a series of 500-1000-foot ""rollers"".Â But when we get to West Virginia and Western Maryland, we will encounter endless 1000-2000 foot ups and downs. 

Our crew: AU grads Natalie Oliver and Inken Ehlers have been amazing, keeping the RV and truck going, handling logistics, and keeping us going.Â They have tireless energy, and boundless enthusiasm and have shared an unforgettable experience crossing the United States.Â So far, 104 donors have given more than $35,000 in scholarships. Let's keep it going! Inken Ehlers Natalie Oliver Timothy Punke Lori Otto Punke Brian Pomper

A strong leader not only provides guidance and direction but also uplifts and energizes the team, serving as a wellspring of inspiration to spur them on to achieve remarkable results. Without inspiration, a team's performance may stagnate, lacking the fervor and impetus necessary for superior outcomes. By instilling a sense of purpose and drive, a leader can cultivate a high-performing team that is driven to accomplish remarkable feats.

Itâ€™s what we call â€œDemand Responseâ€ in the wonky and technical energy community. On hot humid days like weâ€™ve been having, demand on the electric grid is significant. For those signed up for our ConnectedSolutions demand response program, small adjustments are made to the thermostat for a couple of hours to reduce demand on the grid. 

Last week Amy Findlay, P.E. and her team were hard at work overseeing this choreography. The chart below shows what happened on Thursday, when along with utilities across New England, we were able to drop the peak by 300 MW during the three-hour peak energy event timeframe â€“ equivalent to powering approximately 200,000 homes. Amy and her team are already delivering on the vision for Virtual Power Plants.

Speaking with the incredible women at the The Female Quotient Equality Lounge to discuss how  brands are authentically connecting with audiences and driving conversations globally alongside Kellyn Smith Kenny, Chief Marketing and Growth Officer, AT&T, Inc., Maggie Schmerin, Chief Advertising Officer, United Airlines, Jess Spaulding, Chief Marketing Officer, PepsiCo Foods Canada, and Tammy Henault, Chief Marketing Officer, NBA.

Having the privilege of talking with Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns and US soccer legend Megan Rapinoe about the power of athletes as creators at Stagwell's awesome Sport Beach.

Keynoting the Young Lions kick-off, watching the next generation of the creative community on the precipice of their brilliant careers.

Speaking with the legendary Jim Stengel, Emily Ketchen, CMO of Lenovo, and Menaka Gopinath, CMO of the Project Management Institute, about the unique challenges facing Chief Marketing Officers -- or ""Change Management Officers"" -- at this point in time.

Chatting with Laura Desmond, CEO of Smartly, Angela Ruggiero, Co-Founder of the Sports Innovation Lab, Thayer Lavielle, EVP of The Collective at Wasserman, Lina Polimeni, Chief Brand Officer at Eli Lilly and Company, and LSU's dominant basketball player Flaujae Johnson about the power and opportunity for brands in women's sports.  (Side note, not only is Flaujae destined for greatest in the WNBA and as a rapper, but based on what I heard, she may find her way to the CMO seat one day.)

Catching up on Spotify's stage with the brilliant Kay Hsu, Head of the Spotify Creative Lab, about the opportunity for Young Creators.

And just getting incredible quality time with long-time and new friends who are doing incredible things across the industry like Scott Larson, Franke Rodriguez, Laura Jones, David Tokheim, Ehren Hozumi, Eric Hall, Vineet Mehra, and so many more.

Young and not-so-young designers are becoming increasingly aware of this. Many feel impotent: they were told they had the tools to make the world a better place, but instead the world takes its toll on them. Beyond a haze of hype and bold claims lies a barren land of self-doubt and impostor syndrome. Although these feels might be the Millennial norm, design culture reinforces them. In conferences we learn that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" but, when it comes to real-life clients, all they ask is to ""make the logo bigger.""

Silvio Lorusso's book 'What Design Can't Do' probes the disillusionment that permeates design. It tackles the deskilling effects provoked by digital semi-automation, the instances of ornamental politics fashioned to please the museum-educational complex, the nebulous promises of design schools.

Half of the worldâ€™s populationÂ will experience a mental health disorderÂ in their lifetimeâ€”and yet, the vast majority of those impactedÂ wonâ€™t receive any treatment at all.

What's been most surprising to me is that the responsibility to solve this issue has fallen not on therapists or on the government, but instead, on HR leaders, who have been pressured to understand how employee mental health needs are growing so quickly, while mental health benefit utilization remains shockingly low. 

I'm proud of all the work we've done at Zeera to build a new care model that adequately supports mental health needs, without requiring folks to sit on a waitlist, with tremendous engagement rates.

A heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Roberta Schwartz, our honored guest, whose contributions to the field are truly inspirational. Our keynote speaker, Dr. Courtney Burnett, MD, shared profound insights from her book, ""Difficult Gifts."" Her story, which began with diagnosing her own brain tumor during a medical rotation in Thailand, is not just a memoirâ€”it's a journey through resilience and mindful living that has been described as a ""life-changing memoir to be read multiple times.""

Special appreciation goes to Dr. Debbie Sukin, our Honorary Chair, and Leisa Holland-Nelson, the Host Committee Chair, whose tireless efforts were pivotal in the event's success. Thanks also to our Event Co-Chairs, Marc Samuels and Tamar Thompson, for their unwavering commitment to our cause.

Your participation has helped ensure that our free downloadable patient guidelines continue to be accessible to those in need. However, our work doesn't stop here. We still need your support to keep this momentum going. Please consider making a contribution if you haven't already, or share the donation link within your network to help us reach more people: https://lnkd.in/gvTpabVk.

A few months ago, a preventative MRI revealed a rare tumor on my pancreas (solid pseudopapillary neoplasm). Thanks to early detection, we acted quickly before it spread, removing just 25% of my pancreas while largely preserving my spleen and other vital organs.  The tests are back, and the cancer is gone.

Key learnings from this journey:

ðŸ”¹ Proactive Health: Early detection can save lives, and in my case, it did. My cancer was found through a preventative MRI. I had no signs or symptoms of cancer, in fact I was the healthiest I'd been in years.
ðŸ”¹Self-Advocacy: If you're unsatisfied with your healthcare provider, seek a second opinion at another institution.  Advocate for yourself, even when it feels deeply uncomfortable.
ðŸ”¹Â Empathy: You never know what someone is going through. Be kind and supportive, as they may be putting on a brave face. 
ðŸ”¹ Gratitude: Immense thanks to Biograph's diligent team for the early detection, my employer and team at OpenAI for their unwavering support, my all star husband Connor O'Brien, and our friends, family, and community for standing by our family through this. Special thanks to the world-class team at Stanford University for their exceptional care through every step of my journey. Truly the best healthcare institution in the world.

Looking forward, I'm increasingly optimistic about the future of healthcare, especially with AI's potential. Numerous promising AI companies in healthcare are emerging, and I'm excited to support their growth through any way possible. I believe that AI will revolutionize healthcare, making early detection and effective treatment more accessible.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement. This experience has strengthened my resolve to live fully and prioritize health, wellness, and family. ðŸ’œ",6990,6731,255,4,1mo,"Jason Warner, CFA likes this",,2024-06-24 23:20,Tuesday,3:20 AM,6/25/2024,3-4am,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Organizational Change Management, Research & Development"

This announcement continues our strategy of extending our AI investment, and follows previous announcements of AI monitoring, New Relic (our GenAI Assistant), and AIOps.
 
Several organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI for a variety of use cases, and whether they are in experimentation, limited testing or full scale production, understanding how their AI investment is performing and returning value is critical. That is because running and deploying AI applications is costly and hard to get right. NIM helps this, but often LLMs are a part of the overall application, so New Relic allows you to observe all parts of the application, both AI and non-AI portions. Our investment in NVIDIA NIM allows customers to extend observability to NVIDIAâ€™s microservices architecture.

Observability is uniquely suited to solving these challenges for business. This integration further reduces complexity and costs of developing, deploying, and monitoring AI applications. 

Customers can use New Relic AI monitoring to gain a comprehensive view of AI applications built with NVIDIA NIM, along with key metrics on throughput, latency, and costs while ensuring data privacy. 

I am proud that our team is always anticipating and solving for our customers' needs ahead of the market. And there is still so much more to come.

The event, held in Las Vegas, is a technology showcase held for HPE business and government customers. 

During the session, Perry said he and his staff see key training opportunities in respect to AI that work to enhance the productivity of highly skilled clinical, research, and administrative professionals. These groups all need to have both a grasp on the evolution of AI, as well as how it can and will impact their respective operations. 

To help advance our knowledge and discovery of pediatric diseases, St. Jude built a GenAI framework to integrate deep learning models into data science programs. The effort supports the institution's ongoing strategic investments in data science, which date back to the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project which at the time was the largest investment and most comprehensive effort to identify and understand the genetic origins of cancer. 

Perry was also recently honored by Becker's Healthcareâ€™s 2024 â€œCIOs to knowâ€ list, which recognizes IT executives at health systems and hospitals throughout the U.S. who are leading strategic initiatives, implementing new electronic health record systems, enhancing cybersecurity and deploying telehealth services.

As we continue to work through our vision and message, we are also eager to hear from you on your experience with AI of all kinds, including generative AI, in an enterprise context. Please reach out to me or my co-authors if you would like to chat. 

InterestingÂ fact here is that I spent many late evenings at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, 20 years ago, discussing data, technology and its impact on organizations with both Natarajan and Amit. None of us ever worked togetherÂ after that because we were in different fields (Natarajan: Strategy, Amit: Marketing and yours truly in Operations Research). But with the Gen AI revolution bringing AI to the fore, the timing has never been better to bring those ancient discussions back to life and expand on their future.

Needless to add, a lot of these ideas have also made their way into my startup samvid.ai co-founded with Arun Rao, who has also been a great source of encouragement in this book journey.

TyÃ¶ni talousasiantuntijana ja rahapodin isÃ¤ntÃ¤nÃ¤ NordnetillÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤ttyy eduskuntaan siirtymisen vuoksi. NÃ¤in yksi elÃ¤mÃ¤njakso jÃ¤Ã¤ taakse, kun innolla odotan jo uusiin haasteisiin tarttumista. Vaikka areenat muuttuvat, mies sÃ¤ilyy kuitenkin samana. SiltÃ¤ osin mikÃ¤Ã¤n ei muutu.

Kymmenen vuoden ajan olen pitÃ¤nyt yksityissijoittajan puolta ja jatkossa sitten kaikkien suomalaisten puolta. Rahapodin kuuntelijat ovat jo vuosia saaneet huomata aiheiden yhÃ¤ useammin liukuvan yhteiskuntahuolen puolelle.

HenkilÃ¶kohtaisen kehitykseni kannalta aikani NordnetillÃ¤ on antanut paljon. Ennen NordnetiÃ¤ olin toki listannut Suomen ainoan ETF:n pÃ¶rssiin, ollut toimitusjohtajana kolmessa hyvin erilaisessa varainhoitoyrityksessÃ¤ Suomessa, pÃ¶rssissÃ¤ ja ulkomailla ja ollut synnyttÃ¤mÃ¤ssÃ¤ yrityskauppoja. Mutta NordnetillÃ¤ sain viestintÃ¤kokemusta niin perinteisestÃ¤ kuin sosiaalisesta mediasta, jonka avulla pÃ¤Ã¤sen nyt kansanedustajaksi. Se on paljon.

Kymmenen NordnetillÃ¤ vietetyn vuoden aikana sanoisin, ettÃ¤ suomalaisen yksityissijoittajan tietoisuus kulujen, hajautetun osaketuoton ja pitkÃ¤jÃ¤nteisyyden merkityksestÃ¤ sÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤misessÃ¤ on laajentunut merkittÃ¤vÃ¤sti. SiitÃ¤ olen vilpittÃ¶mÃ¤sti iloinen. Kuten niistÃ¤ monesta viestistÃ¤, ettÃ¤ olen auttanut sisÃ¤istÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n pitkÃ¤jÃ¤nteisen, kustannustehokkaan osakesÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤misen ja korkoa korolle -ilmiÃ¶n mielettÃ¶mÃ¤n merkityksen elinkaartemme rahoittamisessa.

ErÃ¤Ã¤n satunnaisessa kaupassa kuulemani taaperon isÃ¤n sanoin:
â€Liisa, sanopa hei Martinille. HÃ¤nen ansiostaan sinullekin on laitettu kuukausisÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤minen alulle.""

Nyt kun Nordnetin pesti loppuu, tunnen lÃ¤hinnÃ¤ kiitollisuutta. Kiitollisuutta siitÃ¤, miten paljon tilaa Nordnet uskalsi minulle spokespersonin roolissa antaa. Tilaa esittÃ¤Ã¤ tyÃ¶nantajasta riippumattomia mielipiteitÃ¤ ja tilaa tehdÃ¤ myÃ¶s muita juttuja tÃ¶iden ohella. Mutta ehkÃ¤ ennen kaikkea kiitollisuutta siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ olen saanut vaikuttaa positiivisella ja konkreettisella tavalla monen ihmisen elÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n. Se on todella harvoille suotu, minulle erityisen merkityksellinen ilo.

Jatkossa minusta kuuluu ainakin somessa ja toivottavasti myÃ¶s perinteisen median kanavissa. Niin ja eduskunnassa. Jutut ja nÃ¤kemykset ovat vanhoille tutuille tuttuja, uusille tuttavuuksille ehkÃ¤ sitten enempÃ¤Ã¤n kannustavia.

The United States is experiencing a rapidly shifting energy landscape due to the rising use of electricity, including electric vehicles and big tech data centers, which highlight the need for energy production and delivery to keep pace with growing customer demand. At The AES Corporation, weâ€™re piloting innovative projects, such as LineVision's Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR), to better understand how we can deliver more energy on the grid as safely and efficiently as possible.
 
You can read the full article where I share more about AES Indianaâ€™s LineVision pilot project, initial findings, and key learnings so that we can get more value from our existing grid assets with improved information. This pilot project reinforces that innovation is a crucial component for a greener, safer, and more equitable energy future.

Here's a glimpse into our week of sparking industry love and creative revolution, anchored by our campaign of Falling back in love with advertising again:

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdcoâ€™s platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = â¤ï¸: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Here's a glimpse into our week of sparking industry love and creative revolution, anchored by our campaign of Falling back in love with advertising again:

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdcoâ€™s platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = â¤ï¸: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Iâ€™d love your feedback to see if you find it helpful.

The usual model of the Social Marketing Mix focuses on the â€œ4 Psâ€ (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) that originally come from commercial marketing, and my â€œ8 Psâ€ social marketing mix added on Publics, Partnerships, Policy and Purse Strings. 

But Iâ€™ve found that many have a hard time making the leap from the marketing mix to what the actual programmatic strategy would look like. 

Iâ€™ve transitioned from the Ps to 4 strategic directives, which together increase the likelihood that an individual will engage in the target behavior. If youâ€™re familiar with other behavioral models, it wonâ€™t look entirely new. And unlike the separate Promotion â€œPâ€ in the social marketing mix, the tactics for messaging about and implementing each element are embedded throughout.

This is a high-level introduction because I didnâ€™t want to make this post too long. The elements of the model (determined by research with your intended audience) are:

1ï¸âƒ£ Make it appealing - We need to offer an irresistible behavioral product thatâ€™s so compelling that our audience wonâ€™t want to refuse. This involves how we frame the behavior and its benefits, showing how it aligns with their core values, identity and aspirations. We can do this through methods like stories, working with trusted partners, and personalizing the product or message.

2ï¸âƒ£ Make it easy - By identifying the barriers (ie, price) that stand in the way of adopting the behavior, we can implement strategies that smooth the path as much as possible. These are the barriers as perceived by the individual, and could be based on a lack of knowledge, skills, negative attitudes, physical, financial or psychological factors. Through methods like simplifying the behavior, connecting it to whatâ€™s already familiar to them, and helping people understand how to build it into their lives, they can more easily move forward.

3ï¸âƒ£ Apply social persuasion - While social factors could also apply in the first two elements, this is where we put the â€œsocialâ€ in â€œsocial marketing.â€ Bring in the power of social norms, influencers, social proof, social interactions, and social support to increase the lure of the crowd and the comfort of belonging.

4ï¸âƒ£ Design the context - We need to reach people where they are, both physically and mentally. This means identifying the times, life stages, and places where theyâ€™re most likely to be receptive to messages and able to take action. And this includes designing an environment that supports the behavior, with contextual reminders, cues to action or relevant policies.

If you are a social marketer, what do you think of this approach? Anything thatâ€™s missing? If youâ€™re not a social marketer, what do you think of this as a model to help you start to think through creating a behavior change campaign or program?

Greenlight is a financial app for families that provides tools for parents to teach kids about financial literacy.

Jennifer Miller discussed two of the biggest needs facing the customer base of U.S. Bank: 1) The need to educate younger people on financial topics; and 2) The need to provide banking solutions for parents looking to open accounts for kids under 13. In U.S. Bank's college campus efforts, one piece of feedback from the chancellor's office of many colleges is that their financial aid department spends an inordinate amount of time speaking with students about basic financial concepts such as the importance of a budget.

Brandon Horne shared how these are areas at the core of Greenlight's mission. Over the past 10 years, they have learned lessons on delivering financial education and building a product that is authentic and sensitive to parents' different views about money. Authenticity is important because brands that develop trust with young people and provide solutions throughout their life journey can create sustainable customer loyalty.

Al Dominick emphasized the importance of trust and innovation. Gaining trust in this digital worldâ€”especially among the younger generationâ€”is challenging. But there can be business outcomes tied to the investment in young people that can enable brands to achieve near-term reputational gain and long-term financial upside.

My key takeaway is that not only can financially literate young people become loyal customers for financial institutions, they can become ð˜£ð˜¦ð˜µð˜µð˜¦ð˜³ customers. As they earn more, invest, and grow their net worth, they may need to utilize additional products and services, thereby increasing customer lifetime value. The learner benefits and many players in the ecosystem can win as well with increased financial literacy education.

One important sector standing out in that landscape with even scarcer comprehension is Black-owned middle-market businesses.

That discovery emerged in â€œ2024 Insights and Perspectives from Black Leaders in the Middle Market,â€ a fresh research report released June 12 by the National Center for the Middle Market (NCMM) at Ohio State University in alliance with Wells Fargo Commercial Bank.

The â€œfirst-everâ€ analysis shows that those firms grew faster than their peers, while facing new obstacles as minority business enterprises (MBEs).

Our Treasury just launched our Impact Report for 2023.  In FY23, IBRD projects helped countries provide 67.9 million people with social safety net programs, 11.1 million people with essential health, nutrition, and population services, and 4.3 million people with access to improved water sources.  These impressive results (and more!) are included in the 2023 World Bank Impact Report.  Big congratulations to my colleagues, including Jorge Familiar and Colleen Keenan, for publishing this critical report.

It happens when all the elements of #customerexperienceâ€” #marketing, #product, #commerce, and #service--work together to create a customer in just a few seconds.

You know the feeling when it happens. 

You see an ad that speaks to you in your #social media feed, maybe for something you didnâ€™t even know you wanted.

Youâ€™re hooked in just a few seconds and decide to click â€œlearn more.â€

The landing page is clear and compelling and addresses your concerns.

You hit â€œbuy now,â€ auto fill your #payment info, or use Apple Pay. 

Boom, youâ€™re done.

How long did that take? If it worked well, about 10 seconds from start to finish.

Easy for you, but not so easy to orchestrate on the other side to make this happen. This takes teamwork, collaboration and organization leadership to unify the #growth levers of the organization around the customer.

Seem like a dream? It's not.

I'm a super fan of the hit show ""Billions"" on Showtime which details the fictional journey of Billionaire & Investor Bobby Axelrod. Many of the most iconic scenes were taped in the fabulous home. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to head back to my hometown of NYC and prep for what would be one of the most notable events of the summer alongside sponsors from EY and incredible peers.

From conversations with Laurie Ann Goldman, CEO of Tupperware Brands, to reconnecting with the rockstar that is Jason Feifer of Entrepreneur Media, and meeting the amazing Katie Couric, so many ah-ha moments were had. Sitting beside founders and leaders from 1-800-Flowers.com, Edelman, Google and more was incredible.

Leadership, networking, resilience, and transparency were common themes heard from guest speakers throughout the day. With three pages of notes, dozens of follow-ups, and mind-shifting strategy points, my heart was so full. Safe spaces to share fears, best practices, and vulnerability are so needed for all entrepreneurs.

I first met Katie Loeb, a few years ago during our journey and pivot to increase public restroom period care access. Katie's support was invaluable, as she showed up in ways that truly made a difference to further our business. It was awesome to fill her and Michael in on all of the way's @femly has grown. 

Overall, in a post-pandemic world, in person opportunities to network, engage, and learn are super important. As the event came to a close and our #ean family circled together, we were all filled with gratitude. As myself and team continue our journey we will continue to be inspired.

I didnâ€™t believe it when they told me and now, Iâ€™ve learned what it means to move to a different department in an organization with over 20k employees.

This marks 120 days as a leader in Real Estate Lending and this morning, I found myself reflecting on the failures from these first few months. I got things right too though, so Iâ€™m giving myself a moment to celebrate the small wins where I set myself up to succeed. 

ðŸ“Œ Planned vacations before I even started

Iâ€™m notorious for rolling over the maximum amount of vacation hours year to year. That needed to change and you wonâ€™t catch it happening again. Iâ€™ve become a better friend and leader for it.

ðŸ“Œ Kept up with my strong connections

With the additional distance and lack of shared work, this has been the most challenging. The effort is worth it though. When the ground beneath me has felt like shifting quicksand, itâ€™s been these connections that created a solid place to stand. Even if it was just for an hour lunch date.

ðŸ“Œ Leveraged a Challenge Network

I learned about this concept when I read Adam Grantâ€™s book, Think Again. They are my expert listeners and perspective sharers. By engaging in healthy debate and calling out my bias, these folks have made me a better decision maker.

While everything feels foreign right now, I know that ultimately, Iâ€™m still working towards the same mission. I get to see our culture from a different vantage point. My community of people is still there, it has just grown. The challenges Iâ€™ve gotten to take on are moving us towards the same goals.

Hereâ€™s to the next 120 days! ðŸŽ‰

Our new research, launched at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity deep dives into how people across generations & demographics want brands to show up across their brand experience journey. Here are a few highlights:

â€¢When consumers are in the discovery phase, production quality of the ad is 2x more important than the product featured, alone.

â€¢Mirroring Gen Z's preferences, 52% of Gen Alpha gravitate towards short- form videos between 2-5 minutes. However, longer content isn't entirely out of favor.

â€¢In the Mid Funnel Consideration phase, consumers want to see Product, Product, Product. Product information is 2.4x more effective than price and promotion. 

â€¢Price and promotions are not in the top five most important creative considerations during the Discovery & Consideration phases of their brand experience journey.

â€¢Only at the purchase phase of the brand experience journey, do consumers rate the actual product offer the most important. Product is 1.6x more important than production which is rated #1 in the Discovery phase.

â€¢While affordability remains a consideration, product information trumps price promotions when influencing purchase decisions.

People are looking for a journey, not a sales pitch. They want brands to guide them from discovery to consideration to action, with creative messaging that truly resonates.

5 years after I founded it.

Here are 5 lessons and reflections:

â†“

1. We don't have product-market fit

- Building an enterprise-grade software is incredibly costly
- No buying intent from Direct procurement
- Procurement managers lack the authority to drive changes internally

2. Creating a new category is hard

- Manufacturing companies prefer highly customizable solutions over SAAS
- Educating the market about a new category requires significant time and resources
- Buyers can't compare and feel the risk is higher

3. Why I'm Stopping This

- We had minimal returns despite significant effort
- We cannot build what the market needs with minimal capital, and open-source solutions exist (more on this soon!)
- Manufacturers are secretive and don't share the word with their peers even when they are very happy

4. Things I Would Have Done Differently

- Targeted more dynamic niches like semiconductors or raw materials
- Engage smaller companies instead of enterprises
- Offer the product for free to get references

5. My Most Critical Learnings

- Don't build something people need, but something they want
- Better be the second best than the first (Edit: Better be challenger than pioneer)
- Use funding momentum and don't let it go away

Richard Branson said, ""The brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all."" I try to live by this every day.

On one hand, it's tough to shut down something I've poured my heart into. 
On the other hand, I feel a sense of relief and gratitude. The journey with RAVACAN has been an incredible learning experience. The lessons I've gained, the skills I've developed, and the insights I've gathered are invaluable.

While RAVACAN's chapter is closing, these experiences will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors. Iâ€™m eager to apply what Iâ€™ve learned to whatever comes next.

I read those comments on my post this week. 

In February of 2010 my mom was diagnosed with cancer. In April of 2010 she died. 

In August of 2023 my dad was diagnosed with cancer. In October of 2023 he died. 

Both of my parents were happy and healthy one minute and no longer here the next.

 They are why I think PTO is important. 


Losing my parents has taught me how fragile life is, how finite time is and how important it is to make memories with my own kids.

Everyone should advocate for themselves. Being laid off sometimes means accepting a job that is less than ideal.  I had to. But we can still fight for what we believe is right.

Work isn't all about PTO, it's about giving it your all while youâ€™re working. Doing your best every day, whatever that ""best"" is from day to day.

But life isn't about working 24/7 either.  It's about finding what works for your family and embracing what matters.

Wanting time off makes you no less dedicated or hard-working.

Be a good human.

Almost 10% of the people in my hometown were displaced from their homes, and this flood caused 7x more damage because of climate change. 

Since then, itâ€™s been my goal to contribute to the fight against climate change. Today, we have the chance to reduce suffering on a global scale, by acting now to minimize our greenhouse gas emissions.

This mission has taken me through the University of Iowa and University of California, Berkeley, where I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to begin tackling this immense challenge. During my PhD at Berkeley, my team at Berkeley Lab and I identified heavy industry as one of the most difficult sources of emissions to tackle, with huge potential for positive impact. 

During the next several years, we explored what it would take to decarbonize industrial process heat, which makes up 1/4 of all energy used in the world and accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions. We designed a thermal storage material and system that could provide this industrial heat at prices competitive with fossil fuels, and proved many of the critical features of this technology on a lab scale!

Our results were so promising that I decided to begin looking into what it would take to commercialize this, and bring the technology into the real world. This brought me to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Cradle to Commerce program, where I met Pauliina Meskanen.

Very quickly after meeting Pauliina, I knew this was somebody I wanted to work with. She has the determination, motivation, skills, and personality required to build a successful company from the ground up, and we decided to start working together almost exactly a year ago.

From these initial conversations, Calectra was born! Pauliina and I founded Calectra together with the mission to electrify and decarbonize industrial process heat. Since last May, weâ€™ve found that high-temperature industry (steel, cement, glass, chemicals, aluminum) is especially lacking in solutions for decarbonization. We are full steam ahead on filling this gap!

Weâ€™ve got big plans, please follow along as we work to build Calectra and change the world!",158,123,32,3,1mo,Ravi Prasher commented on this,,2024-06-26 16:17,Wednesday,8:17 PM,6/26/2024,8-9pm,Wednesday,Congratulations!

It's one of my favourite icebreakers and now I've found a FASTER way to make connections. Here's how:

1. Find the LinkedIn button on your smartphone and hold it for a few seconds.
2. In the dropdown menu, click on ""Scan QR code""
3. Scan or share your code with other connections.

It's that simple!

Remember: It's a good idea to deepen and nurture relationships AFTER the event too. 

Follow up with a personalized message, so you can remember the context about how you met each other.

These statements were taken randomly from some of my clientsâ€™ worksheets, do you recognise yourself in any of them?


ðŸ¥º Usually, I doubt myself and find out later that I was right at first.


ðŸ˜Ÿ I do care very heavily about what people think about me.


ðŸ¤¨ I want people to know that â€œheâ€™s goodâ€ at what he does. I want that reputation.


ðŸ˜’ I worry about the perception from colleagues

So, what is that ONE thing?



These days it is conveniently referred to as â€œthe impostor syndromeâ€ however, it is a combination of several intertwined thought patterns and behaviours that may be difficult to dissect and understand. They could include:

-Depending excessively on external validation

-Self doubt

-Lack of confidence

-Feeling not good enough (or a fraud)

-Fear of failure

-Fear of success

And moreâ€¦

If you have experienced similar thoughts, moods, emotions that have impacted your performance, your clarity and drive and as a result you are â€œselling yourself shortâ€ or are not being as bold as youâ€™d like, know that:

âœ³ï¸ Even the most successful, powerful people have these experiences

âœ³ï¸ Consistent work on yourself will pay off â€“ understanding your limiting beliefs is a first step!

âœ³ï¸ You can â€œfeel the fear and do it anyway!â€ but thatâ€™s so much easier if someone has your back

âœ³ï¸ What other people think of you â€“ is none of your business!

âœ³ï¸ What you think of yourself is entirely your business!

It's one of my favourite icebreakers and now I've found a FASTER way to make connections. Here's how:

1. Find the LinkedIn button on your smartphone and hold it for a few seconds.
2. In the dropdown menu, click on ""Scan QR code""
3. Scan or share your code with other connections.

It's that simple!

Remember: It's a good idea to deepen and nurture relationships AFTER the event too. 

Follow up with a personalized message, so you can remember the context about how you met each other. 

If you found this video helpful, share it with your friends. ðŸ‘

In their recently published sustainability report, AES Colombia outlined plans to triple its installed renewable capacity by 2030, reaching 3000 MW. The great team led by the visionary Federico Echavarria is working on an impressive pipeline of solar, wind and energy storage projects that will triple our renewable portfolio in Colombia. 

With a goal of carbon neutrality by 2025, AES Colombia is a true leader in sustainability. This ambitious goal will become possible thanks to the dedication and professionalism of the team, who is constantly expanding the boundaries of innovation, offering the cleaner and greener energy solutions our customers need. 

At The AES Corporation, we are proud to be strategic allies in Colombia's energy transition, enabling our customers in the country achieving the decarbonization of their energy matrix. In 2023 our solar parks in Colombia generated nearly 150,000 MWh of renewable energy and contributed to the reduction of 54,000 tons of carbon dioxide. 

This way we are also supporting the country's commitments in the 2030 Agenda of reducing carbon emissions by 51% and the 2050 Agenda of achieving carbon neutrality. 

Endless applause to the great AES Colombia team for accelerating the future of energy, together!Â ðŸŒŽ

After 3 great years at Okta, I've decided to try something new and will be joining Docusign in early August as their CTO.

It has been an amazing ride and experience at Okta. When I left Google after 15+ years, I wasn't sure what to expect in the world outside the Big G. But Okta was a great mutual fit right from the very start. Todd McKinnon, Frederic Kerrest, and the entire team at Okta welcomed me and made me feel right at home. Their focus on the customer, continuous push for innovation, and building products, systems and teams that scale really connected with me. The last 3 years flew by. Be it building new governance, privileged access and threat protection products to continued innovation in the IDaaS and orchestration offerings to rolling out a new and powerful platform - we got a lot done and had a lot of fun doing it. Which is why now felt like a good time to move on and try something new. I'm very thankful to Todd, Freddy, the entire leadership team at Okta, my amazing team and every Oktanaut for making my time at Okta so much fun. The criticality of Identity and its role in security and running efficient modern organizations is only increasing. Iâ€™ll continue to root for Okta, and I eagerly look forward to all the excitement and continued innovation in this space.

This brings me to the next chapter of my journey at Docusign. I've always been a fan of this iconic company and its massive impact and reach. The prevalence and criticality of intelligent and efficient agreement management is growing by the day. Allan Thygesen is someone I've always admired and when we chatted about the future of Docusign and how transformative AI-powered agreement management can become, I felt I had to be part of that journey. He has built a great leadership team at Docusign and in all my conversations with them, the excitement and belief in the company and where it's headed echoed. There's a lot to learn, a lot to do, a lot of impact to be made, and a lot of fun to be had â€” Iâ€™m really looking forward to that.

I'm going to take some time off in July to recharge a little bit before starting at Docusign. Fun fact: I literally had a 2 day break between leaving Google and joining Okta and wanted to do it differently this time around. I'm looking for suggestions for books (I'm still trying to do my book-a-month thing but can probably speed that up in July) as well as any fun and productive activities/projects that people have picked up during breaks and transitions.

The week got started Sunday with our Holman 100 Anniversary NJ event. Over 7,000 partners and their families were fired up with concerts from BNL and Carrie Underwood and heart warmed with our gift to the United Way.

Monday kicked off Holman CONNECT our annual leadership meeting. As action packed as I anticipated and highlighted by; 
- Spending time with my amazing TEAM CANADA colleagues and meeting countless new US and INTL colleagues. 
- Chris McChesneyâ€™s workshop on the 4 disciplines of execution to get to breakthrough.
- Our panels on the outlook for the business, enriching our partner experience and our bold ambitions innovating our customer experience.
- Two somber hours together learning more about homelessness and packing and personalizing over 1,200 Dignity Bags for Covenant House.
- And CEO Chris Conroy letter to his 24 yr. old self was brilliant. Insightful, Funny, Graceful and Gratitude filled. 
Congrats to Kaitlyn Pitts and her team for an extraordinary experience.",63,62,1,0,3w,Aarthi Murali likes this,,2024-06-27 15:50,Thursday,7:50 PM,6/27/2024,7-8pm,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

It's been a while, so thank you for allowing me a moment to share some updates via a very long post. Iâ€™m eager to reconnect and hear from you as well.

Reflecting on my 25-year journey in cybersecurity, I'm grateful for the people, experiences, and milestones that have enriched my professional life. From shaping go-to-market strategies for emerging cybersecurity companies to achieving a number of strategic exits, each experience has been a blessing.

As an immigrant displaced by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the boundless opportunities in America profoundly influenced my work ethic and values. The legacy of dedication and resilience instilled by my father, who served with the US Department of Defense, and my mother's bravery which helped us escape a war torn country, continues to inspire my commitment to the cybersecurity and defense sectors.

A career highlight was my tenure at Proofpoint, where we as a team grew the company from $20 million to $1.4 billion in annual recurring revenue over 13.5 years, from early-stage to IPO, and later acquisition by Thoma Bravo. I'm thankful for the friendships forged and lessons learned.

Along the way, I developed an obsession with the US venture capital ecosystem and how it consistently generates the world's most significant companies. Starting with pre-IPO investments in Facebook and Palantir I went on to invest in and help over 100 innovative startups over the last 15 years. This path eventually led me to launch my own VC fund called Inflection Ventures in December of 2022.

At Inflection Ventures, we focus on private companies in cybersecurity, defense, and technology infrastructure, primarily looking for growth stage companies (at their point of inflection) but also supporting and advising friends in the ecosystem across all stages.

These photos are from a visit with Shield AI in Dallas, where I met with cofounder and CEO Ryan Tseng. Shield AI leads in developing AI systems for defense applications, enhancing autonomous decision-making in critical missions where GPS and communications are compromised. Their mission aligns perfectly with our goals, and represents the impactful work we support.

Please message me if you want to catch up or learn more. I'd love to hear your voice. 

I appreciate all of you and am extremely grateful to all the LPs on this journey with us!

All the best, 
Kabe

The whole story is about ""Apple has lagged behind its rivals"" in AI, because ""Big Tech C.E.O.s have fallen over themselves to show they are in the race,"" ""but Apple hasnâ€™t yet introduced a new A.I. offering.""

Ok. This is gonna make me lose my mind. Like, fine, Apple hasn't released an ""AI offering"" - but nobody else has released one that actually works! Does Google get points for their search thing that everyone hated?? Does Microsoft, for adding a gimmicky Copilot thing to Windows that nobody seems to like? Are companies who are tacking bad chatbots onto their products better than those that aren't because it shows that you're in the race?? Is acquihiring a bunch of AI researchers for billions of dollars - even though nobody seems to have figured out how to make any of this stuff all that useful - automatically a brilliant investment??? 

I swear, some Wall Street analysts saw the ChatGPT demo and got excited, and some tech Twitter influencers realized they could write buzzy threads about ""what it takes to win with AI,"" and we all became immediately convinced of this stuff's inevitability. How is Apple's apparent AI strategy - ""We're gonna wait a minute to see what we can do with this thing that's actually useful and good"" - not a *better* strategy than, I duoon, adding a worthless 'Ask Meta AI!' bar to the top of Instagram??",166,139,23,4,1mo,James Newsom Jr finds this insightful,,2024-06-27 17:22,Thursday,9:22 PM,6/27/2024,9-10pm,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,"AI/ Machine Learning, Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development, Research & Development, Transactions"

You shouldn't, yet so many (54% to be more exact*) do. 

Why? 

Because humans have a tendency to not take advantage of things they rightly deserve. 

And this is especially true when it comes to salary negotiations and why I do what I do.

We heard from John Foley on his mantra of â€˜Glad to be hereâ€™ along with the power of learning, debriefs and accountability. 

We learnt from Chris McChesney about the Excellence in Execution. How might we transform while executing the daily? 

We shared out deep insights across multiple panels covering businesses, leadership and customer expectations that together allow us to deliver on our mission. 

I am grateful to have an opportunity to share with fellow panelists Petter Witt Frank Beideman Frank Cardile hosted by Denise Wildish. Denise masterfully crafted the conversation to cover our past century of progress to where we go next. Some key points I shared: 

1. Change is inevitable, organizations that are nimble, adaptable, sense and respond tend to retain customer loyalty 

2. We live in a hyper connected global economy that is experience driven. How might we show up successfully? 

3. A belief that a â€˜healthy partner experienceâ€™ will deliver a great client and brand experience.

The week was topped off by an inspiring letter from Chris Conroy to his younger self that deeply resonated with all and even brought out some tears. Empathetic leadership at its finest was on display. 

Thanks to Chris Conroy Mindy Holman Kimberly Andreola Kaitlyn Pitts for an impactful week!

We hoped to foster a true sense of #community, so we created an adjoining public plaza that could be activated for special events, fitness classes, and more. 
 
This week, at Jefferson Plaza, we hosted the #Jefferson200 Block Party in partnership with the cityâ€™s annual Wawa, Inc. Welcome America festival. It was a celebration of #innovation and #education as we recognized Jeffersonâ€™s rich 200-year legacy and commitment to Greater #Philadelphia. Live music, a DJ, free food, giveaways, #health resources, and a cornhole tournament for Jefferson staff, were some of the highlights. We even had an incredible performance by Phillyâ€™s own Kathy Sledge, a founding member of the iconic group Sister Sledge. 
 
The most meaningful part of the day was that our team kicked off the party with a service project to make 500 sandwiches for Our Brotherâ€™s Place shelter. Volunteerism has been a key part of our #bicentennial celebration as weâ€™ve committed to at least 200,000 hours of service in honor of 200 years. Weâ€™re half way toward that goal and weâ€™re just getting started. 
 
Thanks to all who came out to what I hope is just one of many special moments on #JeffersonPlaza.

Economic theoryâ€”particularly in the technology industryâ€”has long suggested that supply-side innovation can cause prices to fall rapidly for critical infrastructure, even with increasing demand. Think of computer hardware and semiconductor chips as prime examples. 

Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, saw that theory in action. Moore observed that as the number of transistors on a computer chip doubled over a period of about 18 months, the price of the chip over the same period fell by about half. That was way back in 1965â€”and the so-called â€œMooreâ€™s lawâ€ for chip progress and pricing has continued to hold roughly true for the nearly six decades since (a veritable eon in the tech world). But fast forward to 2024, and generative AI seems to be turning Mooreâ€™s law on its head: costs of training the next generation of LLMs arenâ€™t halving; instead, prices have roughly doubled every nine months. 

So what explains this reversal? Itâ€™s all about how LLMs scale.

To date, many of the AI raceâ€™s main drivers have seemed to be hyper-fixated on scaling up the existing architecture. Many LLM champions believe that to get to where AI wants to go, â€œscale is all you needâ€. Just make the transformer models bigger and more powerful, their thinking goes, and LLMs will revolutionize the economy andâ€”for someâ€”lead to artificial generalized intelligence. That view is why frontier model company CEOs talk about numbers like $10-billion training costs for a model and a $100-billion supercomputer.
 
But today, Iâ€™m hearing more and more about scaling down. In stark contrast to LLMs, the small language model (SLM) â€œtheoryâ€ is that smaller models, more tightly engineered for narrower applications and domains, will increasingly supplant LLMs. The same way that fine-tuned four-cylinder engines in a modern BMW 4 series outperform (more horsepower with better gas efficiency) the V8 450-cubic-inch engines that used to power Corvettes. SLMs are also typically trained on finely curated high-quality data setsâ€”analogous to the high-octane gas that the four-cylinder engine needs to use. As such, the costs of SLMs may map more closely toÂ Mooreâ€™s law than their large-language counterparts. 

For the moment, developers and investors are essentially betting on both of these theoriesâ€”LLMs and SLMsâ€”simultaneously. However, that probably wonâ€™t continue forever in the same fashion. 

â€œScale-is-all-you-needâ€ LLMs will have to demonstrate extraordinary ROI to justify their $100-billion price tags, while SLMs will have to prove that they are flexible enough to fit multiple use cases and continue to improve their efficiency at domain-specific tasks. Companies adopting AI will also need to decide when they need a fine-tuned BMW and when they need a powerhouse Corvette. 

I believe this is one of the most fascinating and consequential races in the AI world right nowâ€¦and one to watch closely.",676,607,29,40,1mo,Kristin Nimsger Weston likes this,,2024-06-28 01:21,Friday,5:21 AM,6/28/2024,5-6am,Friday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,"AI/ Machine Learning, Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development, Research & Development, Transactions"

With three companies now having launched driver-out deployments in the United States (Waymo, Cruise, and May Mobility), we've shown that the autonomous driving technology can work. Achievement unlocked!

The next milestone is making the business work. Getting vehicles to operate with billions of dollars of engineering effort, expensive sensors + compute is one thing-- getting vehicles to operate where the revenues justify the R&D costs and vehicle costs is quite another.

Even if the vehicles are amazing, recouping billions of dollars of R&D investment is a challenge. Emerging AI technologies are showing that similar-- if not better-- performance can be achieved with far lower R&D costs. We're not the only ones investing in these emerging methods, but we're the only ones that generate new training data on-the-fly and learn in-situ, structurally addressing the ""edge case"" problem that vexes virtually all data-driven approaches. (That includes end-to-end learning methods.)

Low R&D and per-vehicle costs make it possible to not only develop the technology but also build a business case around it. We're live in six cities, generating positive margins, allowing us to grow our business in a capital efficient way.

And the team DELIVERED! ðŸ‘ 

One thing I love about Schneider Electric is the fact that they CARE about employee engagement. I've been part of many working groups, task forces, etc in my time here. 

One of my first years here, the old Knightdale office had one of the lower engagement scores in the US - leadership came by to host a town hall to ask us what we could do better! We have since moved to a beautiful new office here at the #RaleighHub, and return to people has been really great.. seeing so many familiar faces (maybe not familiar hair ðŸ˜‚) after covid is really energizing. 

Side note - I haven't shared here, but I am the new OneHub leader in Raleigh! Excited to continue making this one of the top sites in the US and one of the best places to work!

Back to the importance of employee feedback surveys though.. I told my team ""this is your opportunity to tell the company your boss sucks."" And while I genuinely hope that is not their impression of me, I'm excited to learn what I can do to make their lives easier, and to make their jobs feel a little less like work. And I'm all about having a little fun along the way ðŸ˜œ What's the point if you're not having some fun?

People are definitely any company's greatest commodity. Your boss and your company should be listening. So when you are part of an organization that does listen, you get what you put into it. Answer those survery questions, raise your hand for that task force.. own your solutions!

Object Rotation Fun Facts: 

ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ In order to mimic the ""pollera's"" natural flowing movement, our collections team used magnets to mount the skirt of the ""pollera"" to the mannequin's hands, similar to the way a performer would hold it. 

âœ¨  No sequin is too small to save! If a sequin ever fell off of the jacket, the collections team would collect, document, and store the sequin until it could be reunited by a conservator.

This award is given to someone who has worked to promote and advance equity in the workplace. To be nominated and recognized by some of my peers for this has been an incredibly humbling (and surreal!) experience.

The womenâ€™s conference has been the most inspiring 2 days, and I take home with me so many kernels of wisdom for my professional and personal life. I am so honored to work alongside such thoughtful individuals, who aside from their day to day work, take on more to make the workplace and employees better. 

I think Maria Pia Tamburri said it best on day 1 of the womenâ€™s conference, when after her interview at Dominion Energy, she went home and told her husband that Dominion had good people. I echo this thought: Dominion has good people to work with and great people to know. Iâ€™m so fortunate to call so many of my colleagues my friends.

Lastly, a special shout out to my DEV Operations Support team who rallied for the occasion! Iâ€™ve never felt so celebrated by my peers and my leadership.

I'd love to see more reciprocation and treasury being spoken about to finance students at universities.  I've seen a few sessions mentioned, but I recently spoke with a finance student after graduation with no idea of what functions treasury performed.  After a 10 minute chat, he added treasury to his list of jobs he was applying to, but I think we need to do better about educating on a larger scale.

This past weekend, I officially achieved my goal of pursuing an MBA. Over the past two years, I've expanded my toolkit with new frameworks, perspectives, experiences, friendships, and significant personal and professional growth. This experience exceeded all the expectations I had imagined.

I couldn't have made this possible without the unwavering support of my husband, Dave Russ, MBA, CPA, and my children, Hannah and Michael. I also want to thank my incredible study group, the Lakeshore Legends: Dylan Buckley, Ritu Thomas, Tom Riley, Manoj Arigela, Thomas Zukowski, MD, MBA, and Ram Ananthakrishnan. A big thanks to my family, friends, and the amazing Northwestern University - Kellogg School of Management faculty and staff.

Here's to making a lasting positive impact in the healthcare ecosystem, driven by the unique perspectiveÂ of a physical therapist with an MBA!

Once an #infoscion, forever an #infoscion
You can take a person out of Infosys but you cannot take Infosys out of the person!!

These statements aptly sum up what #infosys means to me. It is the same emotion that made me return to this firm in 2015 and serve it again. However, as they say, all good things come to an end and unfortunately that time for me has come!

In this phase, I want to call out some of the incredible #leaders who make and have made #Infosys what it is and some of my team members whom I have had the good fortune and privilege of leading.

Let me start with the 6 leaders who left a deep impression with me, an impression that I have observed, imbibed and hopefully internalised.

1. Sandeep Dadlani: Sandeep is the reason for me rejoining the firm. Although I had worked with him for a very brief assignment; he wanted me to join back and helped revive the #saleseffectiveness department in the company. His energy, his #passion, his #drive is second to none and I have forever indebted to him for having brought me back.

2. Deepak Padaki: A #founder among the #nonfounders. Deepak was a personification of everything I have heard or known of our #founders. #Businesssavvy, #downtoearth, #softspoken but #purposeful are some of the many values that I was inspired through him.

3. Mohit Joshi: There are leaders who grow on you and continue to wow you with #values and #behaviours that astound and inspire you. Mohit is one such leader and I count myself lucky to have had the opportunity to serve under him.

4. Pravin Rao: #approachable and #excellence are 2 words which would sum up my respect and feelings for UBP as we fondly know him. The word #downtoearth can be defined by him. His story of the sheer diversity in experience and the lives he has touched is an #inspiration to say the least.

5. Jayesh Sanghrajka: Imagine an extremely strong #businesssavvy CFO, who is #worldclass in his domain and now combine that with #extreme people skills and that in a nut shell is Jayesh. People would do anything to just meet him, but I had the honour of reporting to him and boy, what an experience it was.

6. #Nandannilekani: One of the regrets I had in the combined first 13 years of my experience at Infosys was not being able to work with our founders, but clearly #destiny had saved the best for the last.

But dreaming doesn't mean much if you never put them into action.

Myself and CEO of Lush Decor Home Decor, Paola Peretti, have our sights set on becoming the leading home decor company.

We know that this kind of goal requires more than just hard work â€“ it demands strategic goal-setting and unwavering commitment.

So, how can you set and achieve big goals for your company (or even yourself)?

1/ Dream big, but break it down:

It's okay to have a massive, audacious goal â€“ in fact, it's encouraged!
But to make it achievable, you need to break it down into smaller, measurable ones.

Set quarterly, annual, and 3-5 year targets that ladder up to your ultimate vision.

2/ Align your team: Your big goal should be the company's goal.

How can every team member understand how their role contributes to that larger mission?

3/ Celebrate the wins, big and small:

The journey can be long and challenging, so it's crucial to celebrate your progress along the way.
â€¢ Did you hit a key milestone?
â€¢ Did someone on your team go above and beyond?

Take time to recognize and reward these victories â€“ they'll keep your momentum strong and your spirits high.

4/ Measure, adjust, repeat: Big goals require big data. 

Consistently track your key performance indicators and be willing to course-correct if something isn't working!

5/ Embrace the discomfort:

Let's be real â€“ chasing a goal can be scary, uncomfortable, and downright daunting at times.

But that's where the magic happens. Embrace the butterflies, the late nights, and the leaps of faith.

They're all signs that you're pushing yourself and your company to new heights.

Lush Decor's goal is more than numbers â€“ it's about the impact we want to make, the lives we want to touch, and the legacy we want to leave.

And with a clear vision, a strategic plan, and an unstoppable team, I know we'll get there.

So dream big, my friends, and don't be afraid to set goals that scare you.

Thanks for reading!

I know this should be a formal post from the Bezyl account, but this one is very personal for me, so I wanted it to come from me directly.

Bryant brings with him first hand experience and he possesses the passion and vision we all share at Bezyl ... to see a world where people are empowered to help each other.

I am honored and humbled that Bryant will be helping us, Israel and the world, in this way.

Our friends at WakeMed recently showed that two techniquesâ€”breaking up old processes and embracing self-scheduling toolsâ€”can make quite a difference. All told, their approach has led to an increase of 75,000 visits annually, increasing outpatient revenue by 21%.
 
WakeMed used Epic analytics to identify the causes of scheduling bottlenecks, finding stringent scheduling processesâ€”like what time of day new patients can be seenâ€”to be a key culprit. While using that data to drive change, WakeMed embraced a better digital experience for patients, using Fast Pass to automatically offer appointments to waitlisted patients and using self-scheduling to help patients book more appointments without straining scheduling staff.
 
Congrats, folks!

This transition has been a time for me to reflect on my journey and be grateful for the opportunities and relationships I have had on my way!

The camaraderie I've received from my colleagues has been instrumental in my professional and personal development. Together, we have navigated challenges, celebrated successes, and continually strived to provide the highest quality of care to our patients. 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to every team member, colleague and friend I've had the privilege of working with. Your collaboration, and encouragement have made me a better clinician, leader and person.

As I embark on this new chapter, I carry with me the lessons learned and the friendships formed at St Joseph Medical Center and VMFH. While leaving is bittersweet, I am excited for what the future holds and confident that the foundation built here will continue to support my growth.

I look forward to staying connected and cheering on your continued success from afar.

When I announcedÂ the launch of my fellowship programÂ three months ago, I had no clue how this idea would landâ€”much less how popular it would turn out to be.Â The caliber of applicants and the effort they all put into their applications was beyond anything I couldâ€™ve hoped for. I received over 1,600 applications, many of which came with heart-melting messages, laugh-out-loud-funny videos, and even a ChatGPT injection attempt ðŸ¤£

I read every application, watched every video, and looked at every writing sample. I wasnâ€™tÂ exactlyÂ sure what profile I was looking for when I started, but I knew I wanted to find people who were senior enough to have had firsthand experience building world-class, successful, and impactful products (to have real-life lessons to share with others), while also not so senior that this fellowship wouldnâ€™t meaningfully impact their career trajectory.

Iâ€™m excited to share the inaugural Lennyâ€™s Newsletter Fellows: Tara Seshan, Natalie Rothfels, and Jules Walter.

Tara has spent the past 10 years building software to solve hard problems in health care, finance, and climate. She spent two years as Head of Product at Watershed, seven years as an early PM and Business Lead at Stripe, and founded a health-care startup as an early Thiel Fellow. These days, sheâ€™s working on a new startup in the creative-tools space. She likes to throwÂ pancake block partiesÂ in San Francisco, record a podcast calledÂ The Red QueenÂ with her friends, and write about the friction between our private and working selves atÂ Working Assumptions.

Natalie is an executive coach working with co-founders and leadership teams to strengthen their relationships and build less toxic organizations. After a decade of building ed-tech products at Khan Academy and Quizlet, she felt the gravitational pull toward tending to the hearts of the humans behind the products. She is perpetually trying to sew the perfect pair of pants (still no dice) and recently launched a facilitation tool calledÂ The Ripple Deck. Sorry in advance if she asks how youâ€™re feeling and expects a real answerâ€”you can blame that on being a Certified Internal Family Systems Practitioner and a facilitator for Stanfordâ€™s â€œTouchy Feelyâ€ course.

Jules is a product leader at Google working on Gemini. Previously he was at YouTube, where he launched Primetime Channels with more than 40 streaming packages, such as NFL Sunday Ticket. Prior to Google, Jules spent four years as a product leader at Slack on their growth and monetization teams. While there, he was a key contributor to Slackâ€™s 10x growth. Jules is passionate about building helpful products at scale and improving inclusion and diversity in the industry. He serves on the boards ofÂ CodePathÂ andÂ Black Product Managers, two organizations he co-founded to support underrepresented people in tech. He lives with his wife and two kids in Berkeley, California.

Please join me in welcoming Tara, Natalie, and Jules ðŸ‘",1118,1051,64,3,3w,Francisco Trejo likes this,,2024-07-01 17:53,Monday,9:53 PM,7/1/2024,9-10pm,Monday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Product Development"

In a discussion withÂ President and CEO of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Mary C. Daly and moderated byÂ @CNBCâ€™s Julia Boorstin weÂ exploredÂ this transformational technology and its potential to change the way we learn and work.
 
As I told the crowd in Aspen, AI will redefine how we work.Â The revolution will be across the board, leading the path to autonomy â€“ from airlines using AI as a co-pilot to maintenance workers using AI as a partner to operators in in the energy sector managing safe operations with AI assistance. 
 
There is no question that AI will be a disruptive force, and I believe most of the disruption will be positive. Since it enables both upskilling and reskilling of workers, it will be key to the future of shaping the industrial workforce and our economy. 
 
Today we must begin reimagining the world with AI, so as the technology progresses, we can progress along with it. Iâ€™m optimistic.

In the end, programming is just how we talk with computers, how we tell or teach them to do what we want. Every time there is a new simplification of development that makes it easier for people to ""program,"" two things happen:  less experienced people can develop programs that once took a great deal of expertise â€“ that is, they can ask computers to new and harder things â€“ and the frontier that those with expertise are exploring advances much faster, and things get complicated, iterative, and exploratory again. Just think back to  the transition from assembly language to compilers, from compilers to interpreters, from interpreters to systems like the web that made it possible to specify things in HTML and a bit of glue code that once would have taken a developer. What happened in each case? Programmers who did the old thing were obsolete only if they didn't learn the new thing, and more than that, help to invent the new thing.

U.S. Bank has found a promising solution through a partnership with fintech Greenlight. By integrating Greenlight's accounts and services into its own mobile banking app, U.S. Bank aims to attract the next generation of customers while providing valuable financial education and practical money management experience for kids

The partnership addresses a critical gap in traditional banking offerings: the lack of transaction accounts for children. With Greenlight's debit card and money app, kids as young as 10 can learn to handle money and transact cashlessly, all while being subject to parental oversight. Parents can set spending limits, monitor transactions, and establish savings goals for their children, fostering financial responsibility from an early age.

U.S. Bank sees two key benefits in this partnership. First, it differentiates the bank's ""Bank Smartly"" accounts, potentially attracting and retaining depositors who value financial education for their children. Second, by engaging with kids through Greenlight, the bank hopes to establish itself as the go-to institution when these young customers are ready for their first checking account.

Greenlight's Brandon Horne, general manager of partnerships, emphasizes that the company's bank and credit union partnerships are an additional channel for growth, not a strategic shift. By embedding the parental experience in the bank's app, Greenlight gives financial institutions more ownership in the customer experience and facilitates a smooth transition as kids approach adulthood.

I don't really like to talk about myself, but every now and then It's important we put ourselves forward, right? 

Did you know that I'm PSM3 certified from Scrum dot org, representing the highest level of depth and mastery of the Scrum Framework? 

I'm also an SPC6 with Scaled Agile. 

But who cares about certifications, right? 

What's more interesting is that I've trained and certified hundreds of people in these two frameworks, and worked as a coach and Scrum Master for nearly a decade drawing on these, and many other concepts, to improve the value delivery of organizations. Everything from team creation through to organizational transformation.

Lately, I'm most well-known for, #DysfunctionMapping, a tool now used around the world by thousands of people to find and solve problems and demonstrate measurable results. 

Built from my strong belief in framework agnostic, empirical coaching, my focus has been on taking what I've learned and using it to level up Scrum and Agile practitioners the world over. 

But I'm going to be honest, as much as I've loved travelling the world for conferences, running workshops and speaking at communities of practice, I'm really starting to miss working with real teams to solve real problems. 

So if you've been thinking about taking on a new coach, feel free to reach out for a chat and see if we might make a good team. 

And if you're looking for something more temporary, I'm happy to chat about a Dysfunction Mapping workshop, or part time consulting engagement too.",137,126,4,7,3w,Beverly Steele likes this,,2024-07-02 03:28,Tuesday,7:28 AM,7/2/2024,7-8am,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Organizational Change Management

Pushing whitepapers and webinars to drive MQLs is outdated, ineffective, and way too expensive. Here's why:

Metadata published a report analyzing $37M ad spend on lead gen campaigns.

The result: only 0.2%(!) of MQLs converted to closed-won deals. 

That means you need 500 leads to acquire a new customerâ€”which is painfully inefficient given the average cost per lead of $123.

The driving force behind this is the significant shift in buyer behavior:

1. Buyers now prefer to educate themselves at their own pace, diving deep into content to find solutions to their challenges (without giving up their email address or phone number in a lead form).

2. The buying journey has become more dynamic and unpredictable, with dark social channels playing a crucial role in how buyers gather information.

3. Buying committees have nearly tripled in size over the past decade, leading to longer sales cycles and a greater need for multiple touchpoints.

_____

Your content strategy needs to reflect these changes. Here's how:

âœ… Conduct interviews with your 10 best customers and analyze 20 recent sales call recordings to identify pain points and objections.

âœ… Develop content pillars and topics that revolve around these pain points and objections.

âœ… Identify 3-5 internal subject matter experts (SMEs) who are comfortable on camera and willing to build their LinkedIn presence. Preferably include 1-2 people from the executive team.

âœ… Conduct bi-weekly interviews with each SME. Turn each interview recording into 1 long-form article, 4+ video clips and 10+ LinkedIn posts.

âœ… Publish this content on the personal LinkedIn profiles of your SMEs (3-5x per week). Publish the article and video clips on the website, repurpose the interview recording for YouTube and create a weekly newsletter with the best insights from the interviews.

âœ… After 2 months, start running LinkedIn Thought Leader Ads* to promote the top-performing LinkedIn posts to your target accounts.

*Paid social should mainly be used for content distribution, not lead generation. Would you rather pay $150 for 100 decision-makers to read your case study, or $150 for just one person to ð˜®ð˜¢ð˜ºð˜£ð˜¦ read your whitepaper?

âœ… Launch an employee advocacy program to turn the rest of your employees into an organic marketing channel.

Buyer behavior evolvesâ€”so should your content strategy.

Last week was an incredible opportunity for all. We met with leading researchers, scientists and clinicians at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to connect what we do at Labcorp with the advances they are working on everyday for children who are facing life threatening diseases and health challenges. We also took the time to think about the future of customer experience with the amazing Donald Chesnut, MS and connect  with a few of our local team members at the Philadelphia Phillies game. These experiences all culminated in the inspiration to work even harder for our patients, teams and customers.

At CHOP, we were in awe of the science, but as important, the dedication, commitment and humility of some of the world's leaders in their fields. I left inspired that the CHOP team and the broader community of pediatric researchers and scientists will find new and safer treatments for brain cancer and much more.

Thank you to the CHOP team: Liz Barone, Dr. Stephen Hunger, Dr. Mateusz Koptyra, Dr. Johannes van der Loo, Dr. Stephan Grupp, Dr. Jessica Foster, Dr. Michael Fisher, Dr. Jonathan ChenÂ &Â Dr. Vivek Allada. You inspired us.

Founded by my grandfather and now led by my father, Dan Bernstein as CEO, Bel Fuse stands as a testament to enduring success and unwavering commitment to core values.

Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the dedication, resilience, and integrity that fueled the family business. Here are some fundamental principles that have been passed down through generations, shaping not only Bel's journey but also my approach as an Operating Partner in the private equity space:

- Respecting the Team: Bel has always believed in treating employees like family. This deep respect for the team has fostered a culture of loyalty, collaboration, and mutual growth. It's a principle I hold dear, knowing that a company's true strength lies in its people. 

- Running the Business the Right Way: Integrity has always been at the heart of Bel Fuse. My grandfather's mantra of doing business the right wayâ€”fairly, ethically, and transparentlyâ€”has been a cornerstone of success. This ethos guides my interactions and decisions as I work with founders to build sustainable and ethical businesses.

- Balancing Conservatism with Aggression: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the art of balancing conservative strategies with calculated risks. My father has and continues to excel at identifying moments to be bold while maintaining a prudent approach. This balance is crucial in driving growth without compromising stability.

- Consistent Leadership and Values: The importance of consistent leadership and adherence to core values cannot be overstated. At Bel Fuse, leadership is not just about steering the company but embodying the values that have been their foundation. I strive to bring this consistency to portcos I partner with, ensuring that the companies I support stay true to their roots while evolving for future success.

As I reflect on these invaluable lessons, I am filled with pride and gratitude. They have not only shaped Bel Fuse's legacy but also equipped me to support other founders on their journeys. In my current role, I leverage these insights to help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and build businesses that stand the test of time.

Here's to 75 years of Bel Fuseâ€”and to many more years of leadership, integrity, and success!

The panel will discuss the state of tech careers as we look to the future of technology and the role we all play in shaping it.

The Wave Fellowship, powered by WeBloom and Women in Tech Switzerland, was established with a clear and resounding motivation: to address the underrepresentation of women in the technology sector. Logitech is proud to be an official partner of this impactful initiative for the second year in a row, alongside Google, SAP, and Beekeeper.

Executive summary: To achieve exceptional service results , one has  to excel in three areas:
- careful design of new service and/ or redesign of existing services 
- intentional and repeated flawless delivery of service, consistency is key
- construction of a recovery safety net ( preferably immediately) when service experience doesnâ€™t go as planned. 

The above applies to external (customer facing) and internal (stakeholder facing) as they are inherently inter-connected.

In 2013, The Spring Up E.P. by Shad + Skratch Bastid was released under a Creative Commons license.  That E.P.'s opening cut was co-produced by DJ Jazzy Jeff.  (And this is why I insist on digging through the CC music crates).  Show no. 184 opens with that one and closes with a drum and bass jam from Moki McFly's latest blocSonic release (winner of the 2024 Creative Commons Community Music Award for Album Of The Year).  Other featured selections include the moody downtempo work of DJ Enki, the motivational soul of Niki J Crawford, the hypnotic techno of Ohad Slavin, West Coast hip-hop collective Ultimate Fantastic, and an irresistible earworm from Tab.

Last week, I had the honor of standing on the platform as we rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange for Navigator Gas (NVGS) in commemoration of their 10 years of trading. Looking over the trading floor, surrounded by the history and energy of the NYSE, I understood what it meant to see capitalism at its best where the belief that the free and fair markets offer every individual the chance to benefit from success. The adrenaline rush in that moment was truly indescribable!!

After we rang the bell, we were invited to sign the historic NYSE wall.Â As I added my name to a space filled with the names of so many visionaries and pioneers, I was overcome with a profound sense of pride and gratitude, feeling a deep connection to the legacy of excellence that defines the NYSE.
 
Finally, we were given a commemorative coin to mark the momentous occasion which symbolizes the agreement that formed the United Statesâ€™ first stock exchange.Â This beautiful keepsake is more than just a mementoâ€”itâ€™s a symbol of Navigator Gasâ€™s successes and the collective effort that has brought them to this point.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the NYSE for this honor and to the amazing team at Navigator Gas for making this journey possible. A special thank you to Mads Peter Zacho, Oeyvind Lindeman, Dr. Heiko Fischer, Gary Chapman, Dag von Appen, Randy Giveans and the rest of the NVGS team for a truly unforgettable event!

As reported by The Baltimore Sun yesterday, the Maryland Department of Health, led by Dr. Laura Herrera Scott, has halted the only U.S. inpatient trial on ketogenic therapy for schizophrenia. After a 16-week review that revealed no health or safety concerns, the decision to shut down the study was based solely on the funding sources.

Given the limited availability of federal funding for mental health research, studies like Dr. Kellyâ€™s, funded by private foundations, are crucial. Among the dozen trials investigating ketogenic diets for serious mental illnesses, Dr. Kellyâ€™s research stands out as the sole trial of ketogenic therapy for schizophrenia available to inpatients, who typically suffer the most severe symptoms.

Roughly a dozen patients who had already volunteered were not allowed to participate after the study's closure. Isn't this a violation of patients' rights?

Three patient advocacy organizations, including one representing 750 Maryland psychiatrists, wrote to the health department to protest the decision. These pleas asking that the keto trial continue were ignored.

Help us get this decision reversed! Please sign and share Dr. Christopher Palmer's petition â€“ it takes less than 30 seconds. Sign here: https://chng.it/SbT7zHjNNz

It is seasons like this that I often think back to my own career and what I would have wanted to hear most when starting out. My advice to young professionals is to find the work thatÂ you're passionate about; for me, that was building relationships with people. Itâ€™s crucial to surround yourself with the folks you genuinely want to spend your career with, whether that means colleagues who share your values, leaders who you can learn from, or communities you most want to serve.
 
I remember Frostâ€™s old break room, the Copper Coin, where everyone gathered around 8:30 every morning before the start of each day. It was more than just a place for coffee â€“ it was where we connected with executives, listened to their stories and found new people to collaborate with. Those interactions were invaluable and formed the basis of my belief in the importance of community in the workplace. Offices and work environments certainly look different now than when I started out, which can make #networking feel inaccessible in our digital age. I encourage you to feel empowered to find and make those connections in a way that feels authentic and accessible to you. LinkedIn might even be the new Copper Coin for some folks today!
 
I often come back to a verse in Ephesians about â€œliving a life worthy of the calling you have received.â€ Even if your path differs from what you envisioned, the right people can make any job fulfilling. If, through our work, we help others become more successful, then we can truly say we've made a difference.",366,345,21,0,3w,Hari Kodakalla likes this,,2024-07-03 01:41,Wednesday,5:41 AM,7/3/2024,5-6am,Wednesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Of course, AI continues to dominate the conversation; however, it is still not the # 1 priority for CIOs in 2024. â€œCybersecurity Strategiesâ€ and â€œData & Analyticsâ€, three consecutive years, continues to dominate the list for CIOs. Remember, the importance of CIOâ€™s role in strengthening cybersecurity posture of an organization.

For CISOs on the other hand, â€œZero Trust/ IAMâ€ made its way back and taking the top spot. Finally !

Itâ€™s an old adage that â€œrunning a business is a marathon, not a sprint.â€ I have never entirely agreed with this. Whether you are in sports or industry, it often feels more like â€œa marathon of sprints.â€ 

Being #1 requires bringing the same level of energy and commitment, every day for days, weeks, months - even years - on end.

At Insider., our teamâ€™s focus on solving problems for our customers has made us the #1 G2 leader for more than eight years. 

In the Summerâ€™24 report, we have extended our leadership into more categories, outplaying both clunky cloud players and point solutions to take the top spot in SMS Marketing. 

With a 100/100 user satisfaction score - there is a reason more brands are making the switch to Insider.

Executive summary: To achieve exceptional service results , one has  to excel in three areas:
- careful design of new service and/ or redesign of existing services 
- intentional and repeated flawless delivery of service, consistency is key
- construction of a recovery safety net ( preferably immediately) when service experience doesnâ€™t go as planned. 

The above applies to external (customer facing) and internal (stakeholder facing) as they are inherently inter-connected.

Businesses are built upon contracts, agreements, and reports, rich with facts and figures. Every business owner knows that critical knowledge obtained by summarizing and querying these documents can significantly boost productivity and mitigate risks. OpenAIâ€™s file_search API and Snowflakeâ€™s document AI offer vector and text search with RAG and client-specific models. These technologies improve the status quo but may not fully meet your day-to-day business needs.

Your businessâ€™ pain points might include:
âž¢ analyzing and forecasting data such as agricultural yield or financial projections.
âž¢ computing complex formulas such as shipping cost or carbon footprint from data in reports plus â€œworld knowledge.â€
âž¢ evaluating and negotiating contracts by assessing key levers and tradeoffs and leveraging historical data.

Serving these deeper needs requires high-precision data extraction and schema inference to enable computation and reasoning. Azure AI, DocSumo, and Eigen AI offer extraction, however, they are general extractors by document type. Whereas, hyper-customized extraction and reasoning wonâ€™t scale, and generic extraction of numerical and factual data, even with RAG, isnâ€™t good enough to reason with or compute from.

Iâ€™m helping samvid.ai push this envelope, with a product that scalably meets clientsâ€™ business needs, initially targeting SMBs. This tool extracts data from uploaded documents, infers schema with domain knowledge, and generalizes the ensuing high-level abstractions across domains. As table-stakes, we offer a 2-level nested summary and a chatbot over uploaded documents, with text and semantic search and RAG for baseline accuracy. We significantly improve precision over RAG by extracting the key facts (â€œessenceâ€) of the document into a knowledge graph and using OpenAIâ€™s or Anthropicâ€™s â€œfunction callingâ€ API to feed it back into the chatbot and reasoning engines. This ensures the accuracy required for customers in AgriTech, Logistics, Sustainability, and other domains. E.g., in Logistics, our system identifies discount tiers and surcharges for a parcel shipment based on dimensional weight (calculated weight based on package volume) and the dim factor specified in the contract, something RAG may miss.

With LLMs, we can reduce customer onboarding cost by distilling customer-agnostic â€œtemplatesâ€ from various types of extractors and extending these templates to other clients. This approach ensures that no clientâ€™s sensitive data is exposed to another, thus preserving privacy and isolation. This third-level application of AI gives us safe scalability while staying closely aligned to client needs. With this approach, we can create tailored extractors and implement diverse vertical use cases with low manual effort.

Please check out the demo video, or contact Ram Bala or Arun Rao for a full demo of these use cases.",50,40,5,5,3w,Santosh Menon likes this,,2024-07-03 17:38,Wednesday,9:38 PM,7/3/2024,9-10pm,Wednesday,,,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/f68ef9dd-bb5a-40af-be6d-14c2728a11cb,,,,,,,,checked,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"AI/ Machine Learning, Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Human-centered design, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development, Research & Development, Transactions"

Equally important, by now H2GS is far from the only green hydrogen plant in the works. In 2022, two to three million tonnes of steel had been announced. A year later, over 40 million tonnes had been announced in Europe alone.

The reason I focus so heavily on organization design is because the shape of the organization predisposes the experience that will be delivered. This is not an original thought: It's Conway's Law. (https://lnkd.in/gvew7i7B).

And the thing about Conway's Law is: It's a *law*. You're offering *will* reflect the shape of the organization that created it. Companies talk about how they don't want to 'ship their org chart.' They don't have a choice. So, make sure that org chart is what you want to ship.

And what's spurring this post is I just watched Nan Yu's 20-minute presentation from Config on this very subject, where he challenges the orthodoxy of product/feature teams, and encourages people to *think critically* about what they want to build/offer, and shape their organizations to deliver that. 
https://lnkd.in/g4SgYPur

The only bit of push-back I have for Nan (if he sees this post), is when he questions ""Why is every team 5-8 people?,"" and cites Andy Grove's commentary about 5-9 direct reports for why this is the case. Reporting lines are not the reason for keeping it to 5-8 people. Instead, it's wise to invoke another law, Metcalfe's Law (https://lnkd.in/gS99jrEB), which shows that when you grow the a team, the number of connections within the team grows exponentially. So, while a team of 5 requires 10 links to stay connected, a team of 12 requires 66 links, which is unmanageable.",539,469,41,29,1mo,Monique TeSelle finds this insightful,,2024-07-03 21:48,Thursday,1:48 AM,7/4/2024,1-2am,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Organizational Change Management"

If you're not hitting your targets, that's another problem that needs to be diagnosed and solved. There are many successful, creative people who aren't good at execution. They succeed because they forge symbiotic relationships with highly reliable task-doers.

That's all there is to it!

Remember that all 5 Steps proceed from your values. Your values determine what you want, i.e., your goals. Also keep in mind that the 5 Steps are iterative. When you complete one step, you will have acquired information that will most likely lead you to modify the other steps. When you've completed all five, you'll start again with a new goal. If the process is working, your goals will change more slowly than your designs, which will change more slowly than your tasks.

One last important point: You will need to synthesize and shape well. The first three steps--setting goals, identifying problems, and then diagnosing them--are synthesizing (by which I mean knowing where you want to go and what's really going on). Designing solutions and making sure that the designs are implemented are shaping.

Thank you to Sofia Calderon for organizing my farewell party. It was so great to see so many people I love and appreciate before my departure.

Here is the email:


Today is my last day at SEE. I could not go away without sharing my deep appreciation for each one of you. 
 
You all have had a profound impact on my life. You have, in the last 17 years, shaped me into the person I am, and I feel immense gratitude for that. 
 
I'm not only saying goodbye to a job or a company, I'm saying goodbye to the people who helped me become a citizen of the United States, to the people who supported me throughout my 3 pregnancies, to the people who prayed for my daughter and me when she was in the hospital for 2 weeks, to the people that opened the door for my husband to develop his chef skills at work. I'm saying goodbye to the folks who put people's safety and well-being first, before the job. This company gave me the opportunity to travel the world and meet amazing colleagues in Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Portugal, India, Spain, Turkey, Canada, people that despite the physical distance, have kept close and we have nurtured our friendships. So with that said (and the many things I didn't because this email can get VERY long if I do), you can only imagine how hard it is for me to take this next step in my career.
 
I'm entering a new chapter in my life which is hard to believe. I can only thank God for putting you all in my path. I am leaving a piece of my heart behind because of the people I will not get to work with on a daily basis that I genuinely admire and appreciate.

Blake is differentâ€” he spent 4 years fighting Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

He was responsible for the lives of 32 soldiers. 

Back home, after a Harvard MBA he tried consulting, but couldnâ€™t do it.

He wanted something bigger.

He started a startupâ€”but knew little about business and nothing about tech. 

â€œI was technically homeless at the time. I was sleeping on my buddyâ€™s couch. I had declined $250K/ year at McKinsey... I had no idea what I was doing.â€

2 years and multiple pivots later, he launched ID.me, an ID verification platform. 

It helped veterans access veteran-specific discounts from brands like Under Armourâ€” & helped brands increase loyalty, conversion, and cart size. 

It grew to 2M users in 1 year.

Today, 130M Americans have an account.

ID.me does $150M in revenue, at 80% gross margins, growing 30% per year. 

Blake raised $400M and his company is worth more than $1B.

But it took 14 years & it could have gone a different way.

I asked him if heâ€™d ever thought about going back and taking that McKinsey job. 

â€œAbsolutely.â€

â€œBut I couldnâ€™tâ€” combat just changed me.â€

Itâ€™s not just the money or the impact. 

Itâ€™s the desire to create. To build something from scratch.

Most founders I know havenâ€™t gone to warâ€” but they feel the same drive.

Thereâ€™s nothing quite like turning an idea into reality.

Thereâ€™s nothing quite like going from zero to one.

While the substance of the ideas and trends has changed over time, the key to progress remains the same: 
 
Keep. Innovating.
 
This was the theme of my recent keynote address at the 2024 Oracle Summit where I was privileged to speak on behalf of Deloitte. With an audience of industry leaders, I discussed the macro forces that drive greater simplicity, intelligence, and abundance in the technologies that shape our world.
 
Act one of the proverbial play was a look back and forward on the macro technology trends shaping the future of business, government, and society.Â Act two focused on six implications/recommendation specific to AI:
 
â— Capability evolution:Â expanding (and converging) modality and capacity.Â With the point that image, video, audio, text, etc. all add nuance and insight to reasoning and perception.Â Super-charged as they are layered with context (cultural, functional, personal, etc.)
â— Hardware is eating the world:Â A play on Marc Andreesenâ€™s credo, looking at how infrastructure is moving from utility/afterthought to a strategic fulcrum.Â In the cloud, on the edge, and in the next-gen of end-user devices
â— Hyper hybrid futures:Â Multi-models (beyond LLMâ€™s), architectures for flexibility and fine tuning, and agentric patterns
â— Data foundations:Â perhaps the most important headline:Â the HUGE importance of data strategy, management, and governance.Â For 1st, 2nd, and 3rd party dataâ€¦as well as potential future business models
â— Clock speed++:Â The rise of DevEx w/out borders; AI + cloud + cyber supported by platforms + flow + culture/talent
â— â€œFull contactâ€ leadership/sponsorship:Â Oppenheimer-esque enterprise initiatives.Â Beyond SteerCo consensus or â€˜success theaterâ€™
 
My advice to the leaders to the room is my advice for all of us â€“ be the force that drives us all forward, stay curious, and keep innovating. 

Huge shoutout to Pavel Krumkachev, Mauro Schiavon, Drew Scaggs, D`Arcy Mathias, So Chan (Hong), Christopher Winn, Corinne Johnson, Vincent Senawi , Jason Maynard and the rest of thethe team who helped bring the event to life!",167,158,6,3,1mo,Santosh Menon likes this,,2024-07-04 10:26,Thursday,2:26 PM,7/4/2024,2-3pm,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,"AI/ Machine Learning, Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development, Research & Development"

ðŸ”Œ Letzte Woche hatte ich die MÃ¶glichkeit, die Netzentwicklung SÃ¼d in Biberach zu besuchen und mich mit Denis Merkle, dem Leiter der Netzentwicklung SÃ¼d, auszutauschen. ðŸ¤
Unser GesprÃ¤ch drehte sich um die spannenden Themen des Netzausbaus und der modernen FÃ¼hrung in einer FlÃ¤chenorganisation. Es war inspirierend, so viele wertvolle Einblicke und Anregungen von den Experten aus den Bereichen Netzplanung, Projektierung, Baukoordination und Dokumentation zu erhalten. ðŸ’¡
Ein Highlight war es, das Glasfaser-Einblasen direkt auf der Baustelle zu beobachten â€“ als ITler habe ich das zwar schon 1000x gehÃ¶rt aber noch nie gesehen. ðŸ—ï¸
AuÃŸerdem beeindruckte mich die digitale Arbeitsweise eines Baukoordinators auf einer anderen Baustelle, wo ich die neuesten Entwicklungen und Technologien im Breitbandausbau hautnah erleben konnte. ðŸ–¥ï¸
Dieser Besuch war nicht nur Ã¤uÃŸerst informativ, sondern hat mir auch wertvolle Erkenntnisse geliefert, wie die Netze BW tickt und wie eng Business und IT hier schon verzahnt sind.
Ein groÃŸes DankeschÃ¶n an alle Beteiligten fÃ¼r diesen erkenntnisreichen Tag! ðŸ™

This innovative plant now provides 5% of the energy required for Ferrariâ€™s production activities, significantly cutting fuel consumption and emissions.

The new fuel cell plant represents a major step forward in Ferrariâ€™s commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Compared to traditional CHP (Combined Heat and Power) cogeneration systems, this plant reduces gas requirements by approximately 20%, offering substantial energy savings. Additionally, it boasts flexibility in energy sources, including hydrogen, natural gas, biomethane, or a combination, converting fuel into electricity without combustion.

One of the most impressive benefits is the reduction of over 99% of pollution that contributes to smog and particulate matter, making this plant not only efficient but also environmentally friendly.

Iâ€™ve been absolutely energized by my time spent with the VGS V Team â€“ during leadership meetings, our first All Hands webcast, town halls in Limerick and Dublin, immersion sessions with the different groups that make up this tremendous organization, just to name a few. Iâ€™ve been listening and learning from the best in the business.

The more I learn, the more excited I am about how this team is uniquely positioned to help shape the future of Verizon. Our end-to-end view of how the business operates empowers us to uncover opportunities to simplify, standardize and eliminate waste so that we can invest in transforming the ways we do business using technology, data and AI. This will help us deliver more value for our stakeholders and fuel our future. 

I am thrilled to lead the VGS team, and I canâ€™t wait to see what we accomplish together as we write our next chapter.

 â€Œ
 Our iconic powdered sugar sprinkler that delights strawberry eaters and cake decorating fans has undergone a revolution!
 
 After the entire PPK range switched to Kraft paper, the iconic powdered sugar sprinkler is getting a major metamorphosis! Daddy and Erstein have swapped their plastic packaging for cardboard.
 
 ðŸ¤—This innovative new packaging uses 80% less plastic, the equivalent of eliminating 6 million plastic bottles !
 
 â™»ï¸ And that's not all: the carboard tube is from 77% of recycled cardboard, yet it remains strong and highly resistant to humidity!
 
 And behind this revolution, lies an ambitious adventure of R&D as switching from plastic to cardboard is a real technical and industrial challenge.
 
 This project has been designed and prototyped over the past 2 years by marketing, packaging and packing teams with highly committed partners ! They even managed to upgrade the packaging line rather than change it. 
 A real environmental and economical plus!

Many popular LLMs claim to be open-sourced, but they often lack all the pieces needed for reproduction.

For example, all open-sourced LLMs from Meta and Google do not disclose the datasets used to train their LLMs and as of today, data source is a key differentiator for LLM performance.

Just found a helpful effort that tackles this issue to some extent.

The The Model Openness FrameworkÂ (MOF) defines specific criteria that AI model producers must adhere to for their models to be classified under one of three openness classes: Open, Partially Open, or Closed. 

These classes are determined based on the extent to which the model's development artifacts are made publicly accessible under permissive licenses. Key components include source code, training data, model architecture, and documentation.

â›³ The Three MOF Classes
ðŸ‘‰ Open Class: Models in this class provide complete access to all development artifacts under permissive licenses. They enable full transparency and reproducibility.
ðŸ‘‰ Partially Open Class: Models provide access to some but not all development artifacts, or some artifacts are released under more restrictive licenses.
ðŸ‘‰ Closed Class: Models in this class have limited or no access to critical development artifacts, hindering transparency and reproducibility.


Just noticed that on their website, many popular LLMs aren't listed, maybe due to some pushback ðŸ˜… 

Nevertheless, using frameworks like MOF helps build trust and accountability in AI research by stopping false claims of openness and making sure models are really open. It's something that we should be aware about!",344,305,13,26,2w,Manish Raole likes this,,2024-07-04 21:06,Friday,1:06 AM,7/5/2024,1-2am,Friday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,"AI/ Machine Learning, Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development, Research & Development, Transactions"

Yesterday I walked a half mile to our local farmerâ€™s market for a loaf of rye bread.  Our local bakery was there but they only had sourdough.  Their bread is good so I compromised.  As I a laid the bread on the counter to pay, a group of four walked up at the same time.  I called it a tie and let them go first.  They werenâ€™t there to buy but to chat.  After about 5 min of waiting while they caught up with the owner, I put the bread back and walked away.  Then walked ~1.5 miles round trip to another bakery and got my rye bread.  So my answer is at least 1.5 miles. 

In healthcare we often make people figuratively walk more than 1.5 miles for good service.  Thatâ€™s all changing.

I shared this via other social channels, but I have so many co-workers, Vendors, and Industry connections here whom have been checking in on me, so Iâ€™m sharing this status update of my Cancer situation with you all. ðŸ‘

My 12th and FINAL Chemotherapy session was Wednesday!! I still have to finish the session for another day (I carry a take-home pouch connected to me, that distributes more chemo through me for a couple of days). After this, Iâ€™m scheduled for a scan to ensure Iâ€™ve Won this battle (I can only Choose to be confident I did), and return to a life with more Energy and ability to focus on being here for my Family. 

This experience was full of so many things in my life:
âœ…Fear
âœ…Unconditional Love from my wife (as well as celebrating our 19th Anniversary)
âœ…Optimism
âœ…Ability for me to meet up and hang out with my long time best friend/brother, Roman Rosario 
âœ…Humility
âœ…Becoming a DudePa (aka Grandfather) to my daughters baby, Elliott
âœ…Awareness
âœ…Education
âœ…Ability to work a busy job that I love
âœ…Some good times being able to get out and ride my mountain bike on my non-chemo weeks ðŸ‘
âœ…Some great concerts
âœ…Continuing to be able to coach my sonâ€™s football Team. 

Iâ€™m so grateful for Everyone who spent time checking in on us, Family & Friends who visited to help us out, tons of Co-workers at U.S. Bank who care for me like crazy, and my great neighbor Ryan; who is facing an insanely harder battle with Cancer than I am. 

Others who inspired me are my mother in-law, who is a Survivor; and one of my favorite Football coaches whom I both played for, then coached with; who was not able finish his battle 5 years ago; but I know he faced it courageously with a fighters mentality, and has left so many great memories in the lives he touched. 

Iâ€™m still somewhat shocked to have found out I had cancer, so I hope EVERYONE takes my advice to make it a Priority that when you hit age 45, youâ€™ll check with your doctor to get tested. If anyone has any questions about it, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me.

Iâ€™ll still continue to be checked for cancer every year and promise Iâ€™ll be an advocate for others, if I find someone learns they have Cancer. I am doing my best to stay Optimistic that Iâ€™m a Survivor, and looking forward to getting back to a life of normalcy. I have a few other smaller medical things Iâ€™m managing (back issues) but not as scary as Cancer was (just more pain management). 

Thank you, EVERYONE, for your support and thoughts for my Family and I. #HereWeGo ! ðŸ¤žðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™",701,651,48,2,2w,Beverly Steele celebrates this,,2024-07-05 17:24,Friday,9:24 PM,7/5/2024,9-10pm,Friday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Many of her past connections remained in touch to the end, a testament to her lasting impact. 

I was fortunate, over the past two years following Ammaâ€™s terminal illness diagnosis, to have been able to spend time with her. My heartfelt thanks to all of my work and personal connections who supported me during this period.

â€œStart lean. Start thinking about not implementing everything at once. Start with implementing something that will definitely work first, and then start iterating to improve on it.â€

Too often, people underestimate how much time and effort goes into switching to a composable solution and end up facing scope creep when they make the change.

If you instead focus on making small changes and iterating as you go, you will be far more successful.

Volunteering on the Oversight Planning Committee for The Park at East Hills 25 years ago was a transformative experience. Working with other community leaders, we oversaw planning and solutions created by 300 resident volunteers, culminating in the successful yes vote in 2004. This $20 million park, including the largest pool in the area, remains a cherished asset for my community, repurposing a 50-acre former air national guard facility.

The lesson remains clear: dream big and volunteer big. Witnessing the joy of young families at the pool reinforces the impact of community involvement. 

Dream big and volunteer big too! 

PS - successful volunteerism creates lasting connections and opportunities.

Our health tech startup SeamlessMD was several months into an accelerator.

We were 1 year old and still didnâ€™t have a live hospital customer.

Every two months there would be a big accelerator event where every company still in the program had to sit before all of the mentors and get grilled on their progress.

The mentors were some of the most successful tech entrepreneurs in the country - which meant it was a huge privilege to participate.

But it also meant they knew their stuff and could credibly call companies out if they were struggling.

Mentors would openly debate in front of the companies what they were excited about and what also made them deeply concerned.

To make companies earn the right to keep participating, 2-3 companies which made the least progress would be kicked out every two months.

We were halfway through the program and had been unscathedâ€¦ so far.

We showed up to the meeting proud to say that we had met all of our recent goals.

We then launched into discussing a partnership we were exploring that we felt could dramatically change the trajectory of the business and get us hospital customers faster.

And thatâ€™s when things took a nasty turn.

Many of the mentors tore our proposal apart. They thought we were giving away too much.

Later that day we found out we were kicked out. 

While we knew it was possibleâ€¦ we were stunned.

The reason?

They thought we â€œlacked the backboneâ€ to succeed in the complicated healthcare industry.

We were a few kids just out of university trying to break into healthcare, competing against companies led by veterans with 20+ years of experience.

Why would anyone trust us?

Thatâ€™s probably why we still had 0 live hospital customers despite working on our company for a year.

What really hurt was that the message came from some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country.

We could have said: â€œI guess theyâ€™re right. Weâ€™ve worked for a year on this and have nothing to show for it. Letâ€™s just give up.â€

But we didnâ€™t.

We took it on the chin. 

We picked ourselves back up.

Over the next 12 months we:

â†’ Launched our product at 2 hospitals and 2 clinics

â†’ Had our 1st abstract presentation at a medical conference by a customer

â†’ Expanded our product from just a mobile app to an integrated web and mobile app

â†’ Had our 1st ever patient user organically blog about using SeamlessMD

â†’ Won 1st place at the TieQuest business competition

Today SeamlessMD is used by hospitals and health systems across North America, is backed by 40+ studies and evaluations and is the only solution in our space with direct turn-key integrations with all of Epic, Cerner and MEDITECH.

Now the mentors were right that the partnership structure we proposed was bad (it didnâ€™t end up happening).

And maybe they were right that sometimes we were meek.

But they were dead wrong about our drive, grit and commitment to our mission.",224,194,28,2,1mo,"Margaret Lozovatsky, MD, FAMIA likes this",,2024-07-06 04:10,Saturday,8:10 AM,7/6/2024,8-9am,Saturday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Organizational Change Management"

Freedom Alliance, joined by our partners at U.S. Bank, presented the gift of reliable transportation to US Army Combat Wounded Veteran Justin Shellhammer and his family through our ""Driven To Serve"" Program. Partnering in this program since 2018, this marked the 45th vehicle presentation overall and the 4th of 2024. 

Justin served our nation faithfully, deploying 6 times in 5 years. He has served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and his time in the latter was cut short when he stepped on a landmine, resulting in the amputation of his left leg below the knee. Justin also served post military as a Law Enforcement Officer for 2 separate agencies in South Dakota before Post Traumatic Stress led him into his second retirement. He now calls Ohio his home with his lovely family, and we all had a great time spending the day together.

It was hot and humid, but the weather held off long enough for the vehicle presentation, followed by Justin and his family driving his new vehicle in the following parade through downtown Columbus. They finished right before a heavy storm came through, which finally cleared up in time for us all to arrive at the VIP area just as the Red, White and BOOM fireworks began. Billed as the largest fireworks display in the midwest, it did NOT disappoint.

A great day had by all, and I'm confident I will sleep well tonight. 

Back home tomorrow for a 2 day break before heading to Montana to welcome combat veterans flying into Missoula for a weeklong retreat. The train keeps on moving, and we are fortunate to have many patriotic Americans supporting our mission.

Tomorrow, take a moment to remember the sacrifices made by our nation's finest, and be thankful that such great men and women lived, suffered and endured, and in some cases died, for us to continue this American way of life.

Thank you to Sofia Calderon for organizing my farewell party. It was so great to see so many people I love and appreciate before my departure.

Here is the email:


Today is my last day at SEE. I could not go away without sharing my deep appreciation for each one of you. 
 
You all have had a profound impact on my life. You have, in the last 17 years, shaped me into the person I am, and I feel immense gratitude for that. 
 
I'm not only saying goodbye to a job or a company, I'm saying goodbye to the people who helped me become a citizen of the United States, to the people who supported me throughout my 3 pregnancies, to the people who prayed for my daughter and me when she was in the hospital for 2 weeks, to the people that opened the door for my husband to develop his chef skills at work. I'm saying goodbye to the folks who put people's safety and well-being first, before the job. This company gave me the opportunity to travel the world and meet amazing colleagues in Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Portugal, India, Spain, Turkey, Canada, people that despite the physical distance, have kept close and we have nurtured our friendships. So with that said (and the many things I didn't because this email can get VERY long if I do), you can only imagine how hard it is for me to take this next step in my career.
 
I'm entering a new chapter in my life which is hard to believe. I can only thank God for putting you all in my path. I am leaving a piece of my heart behind because of the people I will not get to work with on a daily basis that I genuinely admire and appreciate. No amount of words can thank you enough but I hope that just in these few, you all hear me say to each one of you THANK YOU SO MUCH!",301,250,51,0,2w,Chad Stephens likes this,,2024-07-06 12:02,Saturday,4:02 PM,7/6/2024,4-5pm,Saturday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Itâ€™s pretty amazing that many people in management and leadership positions will resonate with creating an environment of fear to get their people to work. 

I donâ€™t understand it. All the research in the world has proven that fear-based leadership or management does not work. It may in the short term, but the quality of work will be average at best and never sustainable in the long run.

Netflix just release their latest iteration of their Culture Memo.Â One of the things I love is how direct and honest this memo is.  They know where they need to improve and move to address it.  I especially love the ""Sports Team"" analogy. 

Culture needs to be actionable.Â A piece of paper with some hand-wavy ""values"" is meaningless without the ability to hold people accountable, and just as important, enable and trust your people in creating something great. 

While I'm only 6 weeks in, I can FEEL the great culture here at Ulta Beauty.Â I intend to make it even better.Â Those of you who know me know that I'm big on culture and I put my money where my mouth is on enabling it.

We chose the theme ""Engineering TOIL,"" focusing on difficulties like fully defining TOIL, avoiding discussions of SRE, connecting TOIL to waste in the value chain, and emphasising that waste affects everyone, not just engineers.

The event witnessed record-breaking registrations and participation, setting a new standard that surprised both the organising team and us. The responsibility to deliver a successful session was significant.

Our session covered the essence of TOIL, its measurement within the bank, analysis of engineering and DevOps data using AI tools, showcasing how TOIL impacts productivity and engineering maturity, and presenting strategies to overcome TOIL challenges. Importantly, we engaged the audience by seeking their assistance in addressing these issues. 

It will be interesting to hear how you measure TOIL and what you include in your inner and outer loops. Are your calculation tools, surveys, or a mix of both? Let's exchange notes. 

A few of the questions asked of us are mentioned in the comments section, if they interest or intrigue you.

Immediately some chimed in with convincing arguments such as ""no it wasn't"" (without evidence) while others, responding to the hack with ""it could happen to anyone.""

To be fair, it is unlikely many institutions can withstand a sustained assault from a quasi-nation state actor. HOWEVER, this is why best practices such as Encryption at Rest and intrusion detection are critical for anyone storing PII and providing access to the nation's banking infrastructure. A cybersecurity expert told me the the stance should be WHEN, not IF, and that Evolves response time is a clear indicator they were not prepared. 

Now let's address the elephant in the room. It was not a closely held secret in the industry that Evolve was running fast and loose. You don't need to be an industry insider to or expert to question how a bank of that size can add so many channel partners at that pace without hiccups. As I've said before, it is a quadratic scale of complexity. 

Our Alloy Labs members that play in BaaS started a Center of Excellence three years ago in anticipation that the industry would need to be better at self policing and standard setting. Some of it, like our nomenclature guide and Roles  & Responsibilities which we developed with Unit, Treasury Prime, Lithic, Currencycloud, we've made public (see links below). Others are availble only to members or happen behind closed doors with our next session in Chicago the end of the month. If you are a BaaS bank interested in doing it right, consider joining us.

June has been an overwhelmingly awesome month for me. I announced earlier that I accepted a new role and now I am very excited to share that I bought my first home! 

After living in apartments most of my life, I am so excited that I own this house. That I can paint anything. That I can fill the walls with nails. That I can splurge on a fancy wifi fridge. That I have a front porch where I enjoy the sounds of south city. That I have a backyard where Iâ€™ll try to grow a plant or two (maybe).

So far:
- I am on first name basis with three employees at the hardware store
- I described a saw by the sound it makes when it saws â€œDo I need the kkshkshksh saw?â€
- I have amazing friends who have helped me install security systems, assemble furniture, and enjoyed floor picnics.

Instead, it's about inspiring individuals to believe in the attainability of what seems impossible. It's about nurturing and empowering people to reach heights they never thought possible. It's also about making a positive impact not only within your community, company, and department but also in the lives of your employees and, by extension, the world.

As a leader, your goal is not to showcase your own greatness but to illuminate the remarkable potential within your team. By doing so, you inspire and motivate them to achieve beyond their expectations.

Theyâ€™ve hired 100's of the top salespeople and built rock-solid systems to consistently hit their goals. Here's the #1 most important skill they all have in common:

They deeply understand SaaS metrics and financial statements.

Have you ever read a technical SaaS article or something written from a VC firm and said, â€œthis is too complicated, I will skip this one! â€ 

Many of best GTM leaders had that same reaction early in their career. 

To be the best, you have to fight through those uncomfortable moments, get comfortable with the learning curve, spend time educating yourself, and challenge yourself to think deeply about these topics.

Iâ€™ve found Dave Kelloggâ€™s writing to be extremely useful here. 

I read every single article he puts out.

If you're an up and coming VPs, CROs, CMOs, this write up is a great place to start: https://lnkd.in/e6S_Pxjz

Here are key points (but I recommend reading the full thing):

- Target pipeline coverage is NOT just the inverse of Win Rate
- There is a distinction between win rate and close rate over time
- Itâ€™s important to snapshot your pipeline at given periods through the quarter â€“ he points to the importance of Week 3 conversion rate
- There are implications of increasing pipeline â€“ both from an ownership perspective and a cost perspective

TAKEAWAY:

With classes Pavilion offers, smart veterans like David Kellogg and Jason M. Lemkin graciously sharing their learnings, and more VC blogs than ever, there is no excuse not to be educated on these topics.

Itâ€™s very easy to say â€œthatâ€™s too complicated for my roleâ€

But to be the best, SaaS and financial literacy is a must have

ðŸ“Š Revenue:

ðŸ¥‡P&Gâ€™s revenue ($84B TTM) is 27% above Unileverâ€™s ($66B TTM). 
 
ðŸ¥ˆUnilever is still only about half the size of P&G (if you exclude their business in food/nutrition where they compete with giants like NestlÃ© and Danone , with brands like Lipton -correction-sold to CVC in 2022-, Hellmann's, or Ben & Jerry's).

ðŸ“Š Growth Rates:

P&G (Tide , Pantene , Olay , Crest , Gilette, etc) Â has grown faster Unilever (Dove , Axe , Pond's , Vaseline, etc) in the past 5 years: 4.5% CAGR vs. 3% % CAGR but slower in the past decade: 1.1% versus 1.7%

ðŸ¥‰Other Players:

Henkel: $24B (Persil, Schwarzkopf, Fa)
Kimberly-Clark: $20B (Kleenex, Huggies, Scott)
Colgate-Palmolive: $20B (Ajax, Colgate, Palmolive)
Reckitt: $19B (Durex, Lysol, Finish)

The sum ($83B) is less than the billings of P&G ($84B)

ðŸ’¸ #Profitability:

ðŸ¥‡P&G (almost $15B Net Profit) is substantially more profitable than 
ðŸ¥ˆUnilever ($7B Net Profit), more than 2âŽ.

ðŸ“ˆ #MarketCap:

ðŸ†P&G is the sweetheart of investors. Its market cap is 3X Unilever ($390B versus $135B).

ðŸ¤‘Unilever is currently trading at 14X EV/EBITDA (TTM) and 2.5X Sales (TTM). P&G is trading at a premium 17X EV/EBITDA (TTM) and 5X Sales (TTM).

ðŸŒ #Global Presence:

Both companies have a global footprint but with brands and products often adapted to the local tastes of consumers. They have grown through a combination of #acquiring existing successful brands and developing their own new brands.

ðŸ” Differences:

#Procter: A pure player in home care and personal care.

Weâ€™ve all seen methodologies come and go. TOGAF, once the gold standard, is now often viewed as the stuffy uncle at the agile family reunion.

Let's face it: TOGAF's extensive documentation and numerous artifacts can feel like overkill in today's fast-paced environment. The Architecture Development Method (ADM) with its 10 phases and 50+ deliverables can make even the most seasoned architect break out in a cold sweat.

But here's the thing: while TOGAF might seem outdated, its core principles still hold value. The key is adaptation.

Instead of treating TOGAF as a rigid mandate, we should view it as a flexible framework. Cherry-pick the parts that add value to your organization. Need a solid business architecture? TOGAF's got you covered. Want to ensure your technology aligns with business goals? There's a phase for that.

We need a hybrid approach. Use TOGAF's strategic elements to guide your overall architecture, but implement them using agile methods. Think of it as building a skyscraper (TOGAF) with Lego blocks (Agile).

For instance, replace lengthy documentation with collaborative workshops focused on strategy. Transform static artifacts into living documents that evolve with your organization. Build relationships and embed EA closer to execution teams instead of gate-heavy processes.

Remember, the goal of Enterprise Architecture is to align IT with business needs, not to produce perfect diagrams. TOGAF provides a robust framework, but it's up to us to apply it judiciously.

So, is TOGAF still relevant? Yes, but not in its pure form. Understanding its fundamentals is crucial, but applying them with agility is key.

What's your take? How have you adapted traditional EA frameworks to fit an agile world? Share your experiences!

Weâ€™ve all seen methodologies come and go. TOGAF, once the gold standard, is now often viewed as the stuffy uncle at the agile family reunion.

Let's face it: TOGAF's extensive documentation and numerous artifacts can feel like overkill in today's fast-paced environment. The Architecture Development Method (ADM) with its 10 phases and 50+ deliverables can make even the most seasoned architect break out in a cold sweat.

But here's the thing: while TOGAF might seem outdated, its core principles still hold value. The key is adaptation.

Instead of treating TOGAF as a rigid mandate, we should view it as a flexible framework. Cherry-pick the parts that add value to your organization. Need a solid business architecture? TOGAF's got you covered. Want to ensure your technology aligns with business goals? There's a phase for that.

We need a hybrid approach. Use TOGAF's strategic elements to guide your overall architecture, but implement them using agile methods. Think of it as building a skyscraper (TOGAF) with Lego blocks (Agile).

For instance, replace lengthy documentation with collaborative workshops focused on strategy. Transform static artifacts into living documents that evolve with your organization. Build relationships and embed EA closer to execution teams instead of gate-heavy processes.

Remember, the goal of Enterprise Architecture is to align IT with business needs, not to produce perfect diagrams. TOGAF provides a robust framework, but it's up to us to apply it judiciously.

So, is TOGAF still relevant? Yes, but not in its pure form. Understanding its fundamentals is crucial, but applying them with agility is key.

What's your take? How have you adapted traditional EA frameworks to fit an agile world? Share your experiences!

I'm not a LinkedIn social selling expert. Far from it.

But, the most compelling DMs usually make the other person feel seen, heard, or understood. 

We don't have to use excessive flattery or praise. 

The word ""impressed"" or ""impressive"" has been grossly overused by AI-generated copy. 

Here's an uncommon DM I like. 

Use it when a new connection liked/commented on another person's post you found helpful.

Ex:

""Followed Nate Nasralla yesterday because of you. I tried his ""accurate vs. optimistic"" email on a stuck deal today. Thanks for introducing me to his content! Any other creators you'd recommend for Enterprise Sales? Either way - glad to be connected.""

PS - should go without saying, but don't fake or automate these.

I am sharing my farewell email as I want to make sure this note gets to them too! 

Thank you to Sofia Calderon for organizing my farewell party. It was so great to see so many people I love and appreciate before my departure.

Here is the email:


Today is my last day at SEE. I could not go away without sharing my deep appreciation for each one of you. 
 
You all have had a profound impact on my life. You have, in the last 17 years, shaped me into the person I am, and I feel immense gratitude for that. 
 
I'm not only saying goodbye to a job or a company, I'm saying goodbye to the people who helped me become a citizen of the United States, to the people who supported me throughout my 3 pregnancies, to the people who prayed for my daughter and me when she was in the hospital for 2 weeks, to the people that opened the door for my husband to develop his chef skills at work. I'm saying goodbye to the folks who put people's safety and well-being first, before the job. This company gave me the opportunity to travel the world and meet amazing colleagues in Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Portugal, India, Spain, Turkey, Canada, people that despite the physical distance, have kept close and we have nurtured our friendships. So with that said (and the many things I didn't because this email can get VERY long if I do), you can only imagine how hard it is for me to take this next step in my career.
 
I'm entering a new chapter in my life which is hard to believe. I can only thank God for putting you all in my path. I am leaving a piece of my heart behind because of the people I will not get to work with on a daily basis that I genuinely admire and appreciate. No amount of words can thank you enough but I hope that just in these few, you all hear me say to each one of you THANK YOU SO MUCH!",301,250,51,0,2w,Chad Stephens liked William Hickeyâ€™s comment on this,,2024-07-08 22:58,Tuesday,2:58 AM,7/9/2024,2-3am,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Where can I even begin? 6.5 years ago I made the decision to move to Sydney, Australia for a role as a Clinical Educator with Permobil Australia. Itâ€™s been the experience of a lifetime and now after 6.5 years my journey is coming to an end.

Itâ€™s been a privilege and honor to have been part of the Clinical Serives team and to have built this team over the last 6 years with the most incredible individuals that possess the very core values of Permobil and who strive every day to provide the best possible support to clinicians. I could never have imagined a more perfect team to have been a part of. Tracee-lee Maginnity Rainy Wu Tilly Brook Roseanna T. and with the support of the incredibly talented Mau Itagaki. 

I have been so incredibly lucky to have traveled throughout Australia, New Zeland, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea during my time with Permobil APAC and I can never explain how special each country is to me. Thank you to all my Permobil family for always making me feel so welcome. 

And finally a big thank you to Owen Dawes for giving me this opportunity of a lifetime, for always believing in me and for supporting me through all my crazy ideas and dreams. 

I leave with incredible sadness but also with so many wonderful memories. And as each journey comes to an end the next one beginsâ€¦. 

And I am very happy to say that this next journey continues with Permobil. ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ More to comeâ€¦",178,162,16,0,1mo,Deborah Backus loves this,,2024-07-09 00:26,Tuesday,4:26 AM,7/9/2024,4-5am,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Many latest research works seek to improve performance over basic RAG architectures, however, they struggle with complex implementation and long response times.

This new paper investigates existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal practices. Through extensive experiments, the authors suggest several strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and efficiency.

The infographic in itself (below) is extremely useful too.  It breaks down the pipeline into smaller stages and lists methods for each stage.

Putting innovation to work is at the core of everything we do at AES. â€œIt starts with cultural adoption - putting the tools in our peopleâ€™s hands so they can see it and start testing and innovating their own experience,â€ Dave said. 

â€œAI also provides an opportunity to reimagine how we do everything,â€ Ashley noted, referencing AESâ€™ collaboration with X, the moonshot factory (formerly Google X) on transforming how clean energy connects with the grid, and leveraging AI in AESâ€™ solar robots to assist workers, enhance safety, and speed up deployment.

Our partnership with the brightest minds and leveraging cutting-edge technology, like AI, is propelling us into the future of clean energy and beyond.

Iâ€™m excited to announce Iâ€™ll be riding in Pelotonia for my 2nd time this year! Last yearâ€™s 24 mile ride was a tremendous experience for me personally and I am excited to participate again this year on August 4th. Pelotonia is the second largest cycling event in the nation and raises money for innovative cancer research at the OSUCCC - James. Â Cancer has the potential to impact us all â€“ ourselves, our loved ones, young/ old, rich/poor, healthy/ sick.Â Â It is an indiscriminate disease.Â Itâ€™s staggering to think about the number of people in my life that have been impacted by cancer.Â Some with positive outcomes, others without. This year Iâ€™ve committed to raise $5,000 â€“ and I ask for your help in raising these funds. 100% of the funds go directly to cancer research: 

To make a donation, please follow this link to my profile page: https://lnkd.in/gaQy_sTA 

Please join me in raising money to fund continued research in prevention, screening and treatment of all types of cancer.Â While the race and research center are in Columbus, the benefits are far reaching.Â Â The James is part of the Big 10 Cancer Research Consortium along with other partnerships.

I look forward to my last two years on the board before I will term off at the end of June in 2026. 

I still remember my first board meeting in 2012 and how excited I was to get involved with such a vital business organization.  The chamber represents over 1,300 businesses with a collective workforce of 70,000 employees in its membership.  The chamber is doing amazing work in helping to advocate for businesses and their employees, to help and create housing solutions to attract needed workforce to the area, to address the challenges of childcare that continue to be a barrier for many people, and to work with businesses large and small to address the challenges they face.

I am fortunate that I had the opportunity to learn from amazing business leaders in our community and follow in the footsteps of prior board chairs during my tenure that included James Cohen, Michael Bourque, Jim Erwin, Al Swallow, and Asha Echeverria.  I am also thrilled to watch Georgia Wraight step into the role as chair as I know she is another remarkable leader and have been honored to get to know her over the past several years.  To all of those I have served on the board with, thank you for your time and energy and all that you do for the region.

I want to recognize the amazing staff of the chamber: Eamonn D., Estela Pineda, Rachel Carruthers, Riley Legere and Tommy Johnson.  Small but mighty is an understatement for all the work that you accomplish.  You are all incredible individuals that are helping move Maine forward and cannot thank you enough for all you do.

I would also like to thank Quincy Hentzel for the countless lunches at the Cumberland Club, executive meetings at the chamber offices and coffee meetings to discuss the organization.  I am forever grateful for your unmatched leadership in the community and am happier to call you a great friend!

Lastly, I would like to thank my family for accommodating early morning meetings, meetings during days off and many nights I got home late.

As immediate past chair, I have the distinct pleasure of stepping into the role of board chair for the Greater Portland Business Education Collaborative, a 501c3 organization established by the Portland Regional Chamber.  I thank Asha Echeverria for all her work in establishing this entity and being the founding chair for the past two years and Jack Lufkin for agreeing to not only take over as Treasurer for the Portland Regional Chamber when Al Swallow asked me to be Vice Chair in 2020, but for also agreeing to be Treasurer for this new entity.",128,121,3,4,2w,Beverly Steele likes this,,2024-07-09 20:52,Wednesday,12:52 AM,7/10/2024,12-1am,Wednesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

The people with all the ideas were shunned and pushed aside, while the tush-kissers with no plans got promoted. 
 
The harder David worked, the worse he got treated. Finally, when a completely unqualified person got promoted to be his manager because that manager had a personal relationship with one of the VPs, that was the last straw; David resigned. It was hard for him to leave the company he worked so hard for, but he felt a huge weight lifted off his shoulders the minute he was out of there. 

I came across this story in Liz Ryanâ€™s article in Forbes, and it resonates with the experiences of numerous individuals in organizations around the globe. Great employees who came into the organization with an inspired heart and a spark in their eyes, ready to make a difference, got uninspired and demotivated when they soon realized that their environment was toxic to the core. 
 
Never settle for any toxic, fear-based organization. 

Remember, your professional development, health, and energy are of utmost importance. Don't let a toxic work environment compromise these. There are always other options out there, and you deserve to work in an environment that values and nurtures you, helping you become the best version of yourself.

Two cornerstones of my professional investing career have been (i) bridging the EU/UK and US startup ecosystems and (ii) a maniacal focus on providing candor, empathy and commercial value to the founders I've been lucky to back. When I made my mind up over a year ago that I was ready after 13 years of CVC across 2 Fortune 500 companies to transition to a pure financial role, I sought out up-and-coming funds with founder first ideologies who similarly recognized the synergies of cross-Atlantic investing and the massive energy transition investment opportunity, especially in Europe. On the value-add front, I am swapping out a big OEM-based commercial GTM machine with a proprietary partnership that Giant has built with McKinsey and one of the most hyper-connected group of strategic advisors, LPs and venture partners I've ever come across. Giant backs purpose-driven founders solving the worldâ€™s biggest problems and for a small taste of Giant's convening power and thought leadership, you should check out a recap of our recent Giant Ideas summit in London where we had Ray Dalio and Richard Branson, among many others, speak: https://lnkd.in/gymZZMv5

I will be mostly focused in my part-time capacity on helping drive Series B opportunities for Giant's Early Growth (EGII) fund. If you're an LP potentially interested in the $150M fund we're closing now, I'd love to chat.

Because of this, Iâ€™m very aware of the many challenges children in foster care face, including the loss of critical support systems as they transition into adulthood. Caring for all kids, no matter their circumstances or their age, is important to me and important to UnitedHealthcare.

To help youth transition out of foster care, we've developed three training programs centered on independence and support. The first helps teach those in the child welfare system life skills they'll need after aging out. The second helps families gain and retain their foster caregiver license. The third helps providers better understand the unique needs and challenges facing foster youth. These programs are just some of the initiatives weâ€™re working to improve the well-being of kids in the foster care system.

Georgia Tech is the top producer in the country of current employed AI graduates per JLL research.

Recently in collaboration with NVIDIA, Tech has created The AI Makerspace, a supercomputer hub that gives students access to computing resources typically available only to researchers or tech companies. It means hands-on experience for our students, deepening their skills and preparing them to be the new generation of AI professionals.

Additionally, Tech AI, the AI Hub at Georgia Institute of Technology, brings together hundreds of thought leaders, researchers, doers, and teachers across campus, working together to advance AI - using it responsibly to create new products, educate students of all ages and backgrounds, and develop tomorrow's AI workforce.

Appreciate Tech leaders including Pascal Van Hentenryck and Ãngel Cabrera for their dedication on these initiatives!

I am super excited to share that earlier this week I was promoted to Senior Release Train Engineer at Humana! 

 
Release Train Engineer, you ask? What about project management? 


This role is a step up the proverbial ladder from being a PM, and is a role that comes from the Agile world. In really simple speak, I will be taking on the responsibilities of a program manager, but with an Agile focus. 

Iâ€™ll be sharing more about the role and how I got here soon, (including how the #PMP played a part). But for now, Iâ€™m celebrating! 

 
Thank you to my cheerleaders at Humana and beyond. I think back to where I have come from compared to where I am now, and I count myself among the luckiest to know all of you. 

Stay tuned for some deep dive posts on my strategies and learnings from this promotion process!

It has been a year since my last day at Verizon and what a year it has been! 

This past year, I prioritized my self-care.Â Whatever that needed to be at the moment.Â Sometimes, that meant being busy, sometimes resting, sometimes doing a project, and sometimes thinking and writing.Â This was a year of learning and unlearning.Â There were moments of pure happiness and crippling fear.Â Iâ€™m thankful for this journey and the amazing friends and family I have to support me. 

My success metrics have shifted significantly. I used to look at compensation, title, year end ratings, how much work I accomplished, etc.Â Now I look at percentage of happiness. Â Iâ€™m generally a happy person,but I can honestly say I am sitting at a higher percentage than I was a year ago.Â The best part is that I am in control of that number.Â I can remove things from the equation to increase the percentage all the time.Â If something is not serving my happiness, it gets removed, or in the cases where I canâ€™t remove it, I come up with ways to limit the impact it has on me.Â Itâ€™s hard !!!! But itâ€™s the best work I can do for myself! 

Recently, I saw a friend. I was talking about my small business when she stopped me and said, â€œLook how happy you are. I havenâ€™t seen this version of Chris in years.â€Â Itâ€™s amazing when others notice, too ðŸ˜Š

I added a few other things to my year-end performance reviewâ€”it feels like a â€œleading ratingâ€ to me! 

âœ… Enjoyed some amazing vacations.
âœ… Wrote and published my first book 
âœ… Packed up and sold our home
âœ… Relocated to the Jersey Shore
âœ… Laid the foundation and significantly grew my small business 
âœ… Filled my calendar with countless catch-up calls, videos, and lunches, reconnecting with amazing people 
âœ… Many therapy sessions deconstructing what I want to carry forward and leave behind from my corporate career

Hurricane Beryl has significantly impacted our communities in Texas, and my heart goes out to everyone affected. 

On this National Lineworker Appreciation Day, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all lineworkers for their essential role in our communities. I know from experience that our dedicated line workers are working tirelessly, around the clock, to restore power to impacted homes and businesses in Texas. Their bravery and dedication are nothing short of heroic. While most people seek safety away from the storm, our lineworkers head straight into it, undeterred and resolute in their mission to restore normalcy. 

I have absolute confidence in Eliecer Viamontes, President and CEO of Entergy Texas. He is a proven leader who will not rest until every single customer is restored. The men and women of Entergy are on the ground, and working long hours through the night to restore power as quickly as possible. 

For specific information regarding restoration and storm damage, customers can visit the Entergy newsroom. Here are some essential safety tips to keep in mind if you lose power:

ðŸ’¡ Stay away from downed power lines and assume they are energized.

ðŸ’¡ Report an outage on the MyEntergy site or call 1-800-9OUTAGE. Thereâ€™s no need to speak with a representative if you report online.

ðŸ’¡ Use your portable generator safely. Do not run it in enclosed spaces. Only connect your generator to the whole house if installed by a licensed electrician to prevent backfeed to the distribution system.

ðŸ’¡ Minimize opening refrigerator and freezer doors to keep food cold longer.

ðŸ’¡ Please stay clear of our workers as they safely restore power.

ðŸ’¡ Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters.

Download the free Entergy app and follow the company on Twitter or Facebook for the latest updates.

Here are a few items that particularly stood out to me:

â€œGaining confidence and ability early on (for example, asking Copilot to recap a meeting) helps users maintain a healthy growth mindset when they hit the inevitable road bumps.â€ â€“ in my experience those road bumps came early and often, and we saw a significant drop-off in participation when other success factors like leadership support or peer learning opportunities werenâ€™t in place.

â€œRolling out Copilot to entire teams at onceâ€”even if theyâ€™re small onesâ€”is crucial in promoting peer-to-peer learning: It encourages sharing and learning among the group members, multiplying the impact of the technology. It also allows organizations to see patterns to help identify whatâ€™s working (or whatâ€™s not).â€Â I think this is very true â€“ particularly the peer-to-peer learning piece.Â Too bad itâ€™s so expensive that itâ€™s difficult to justify â€œlicenses for allâ€ in the early stages.

â€œThrough managers and rollout leaders, we identified people who were most excited to dive into the technology and share what they learned with their peers. We then empowered them to lead internal trainings and create quick demo videos to share their skills. That grassroots approach allows others to see the potentialâ€”and inspires them to explore the technology for themselves.â€ - Yes.Â Great.Â No notes.Â Dig into the piece to read more about the AI council. 

"" 'You have to celebrate people who are adopting AI and showcase their efforts,' says Hossein Nowbar, Chief Legal Officer at Microsoft. 'We had early adopters of AI join me onstage during our department-wide summit to talk about how they are leveraging AI and the efficiencies they gained.' This recognition inspires others to join the AI journey.""Â - this is so important.Â Leaders not only have to recognize and celebrate, they have to role model adoption themselves, set a clear expectation that their teams will lean in, and create space and time for them to do so.Â This simply will not come without learning curve.Â Itâ€™s not just that the technology is new, we are all going to have to go through some discomfort to change our work patterns.  If an employee's immediate manager is not actively accommodating this learning and discomfort,  the effort will fail.

Or don't. What matters is the intentionality, knowing what good looks like, and iterating/adapting as needed.

The hardest part, IMHO, is knowing what good looks like. If you've never worked on a team with rich collaboration between engineers, you can easily rationalize ditching the stand-ups because they feel like a waste of time. It *feels* superfluous.

If, on the other hand, you've experienced different cultures and approaches and understand the Why behind the practices, you can pick, choose, and adapt.",123,106,13,4,1w,Beverly Steele likes this,,2024-07-11 00:32,Thursday,4:32 AM,7/11/2024,4-5am,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Paul's visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to physician-directed care have been instrumental in shaping the legacy of what was once DuPage Medical Group and now thrives as Duly.

Throughout his tenure, Paul has exemplified what it means to be a disruptor in healthcare. He consistently puts patients and his physician colleagues at the forefront, striving for innovations that lead to positive outcomes for everyone involved. His approach not only enhances patient care but also empowers doctors to lead and innovate within their fields.

In the time that Paul and I have been leaders together, his insights and dedication have inspired me as a leader at Duly. His infectious enthusiasm and unwavering support make every challenge more manageable and every success more enjoyable. His deep commitment to our mission energizes not just me but our entire organization to continue advancing the practice of medicine every day.

Please join me in congratulating Dr. Merrick on this remarkable anniversary. Hereâ€™s to many more years of inspiring leadership and transformational healthcare.

Because of this, Iâ€™m very aware of the many challenges children in foster care face, including the loss of critical support systems as they transition into adulthood. Caring for all kids, no matter their circumstances or their age, is important to me and important to UnitedHealthcare.

To help youth transition out of foster care, we've developed three training programs centered on independence and support. The first helps teach those in the child welfare system life skills they'll need after aging out. The second helps families gain and retain their foster caregiver license. The third helps providers better understand the unique needs and challenges facing foster youth. These programs are just some of the initiatives weâ€™re working to improve the well-being of kids in the foster care system.

Because of this, Iâ€™m very aware of the many challenges children in foster care face, including the loss of critical support systems as they transition into adulthood. Caring for all kids, no matter their circumstances or their age, is important to me and important to UnitedHealthcare.

To help youth transition out of foster care, we've developed three training programs centered on independence and support. The first helps teach those in the child welfare system life skills they'll need after aging out. The second helps families gain and retain their foster caregiver license. The third helps providers better understand the unique needs and challenges facing foster youth. These programs are just some of the initiatives weâ€™re working to improve the well-being of kids in the foster care system.

Things I have learned: 
- GSD
- Double everything
- Scale is hard
- Breaking production is not okay
- Innovation is what you make it
- If you aren't having fun are you even working?
- We can move very quickly when we need to
- I think you are mute: ""Yes that's on purpose""
- Big things can be done with small budget
- Product management is a hell of a job

Great coworkers are why I have continued to stay at this company, some have left, some have come back, some I still work with today. I decided to come work at this company because I knew it would be a challenge to try to meet customers retail & healthcare needs at huge scale; people have changed, company has changed, but I have just stuck with the mantra we are helping people, truly helping people, and I think there is something great about that. #SeeYouInAnother10",227,198,29,0,3w,Stephen Ma likes this,,2024-07-11 17:59,Thursday,9:59 PM,7/11/2024,9-10pm,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development"

Things I have learned: 
- GSD
- Double everything
- Scale is hard
- Breaking production is not okay
- Innovation is what you make it
- If you aren't having fun are you even working?
- We can move very quickly when we need to
- I think you are mute: ""Yes that's on purpose""
- Big things can be done with small budget
- Product management is a hell of a job

Great coworkers are why I have continued to stay at this company, some have left, some have come back, some I still work with today. I decided to come work at this company because I knew it would be a challenge to try to meet customers retail & healthcare needs at huge scale; people have changed, company has changed, but I have just stuck with the mantra we are helping people, truly helping people, and I think there is something great about that. #SeeYouInAnother10",227,198,29,0,3w,Stephen Ma liked Stefanie Kruse Curleyâ€™s comment on this,,2024-07-11 19:47,Thursday,11:47 PM,7/11/2024,11-12am,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development"

Melanie did not disappoint. During her fireside chat, which was brilliantly moderated by the amazing Anna Winderbaum, Melanie told us the story that has led to her amazing professional and personal success â€” all in her wonderfully authentic and humorous way. 

I especially loved her story about joining the Firm, being the only woman in her group, and how she moved from being a lawyer to now running a hugely successful business, as Head of Field Engagement & Philanthropy Management at Morgan Stanley.

Healthcare cybersecurity is often approached, assessed, analyzed, and managed from a functional perspective. In the world of interoperability and complexity of the digital health ecosystem, measuring security measures and costs arenâ€™t enough because nothing tied to cyber is ever finished. As threats have evolved and expanded, digital health has followed. But for many entities that find themselves in the have-nots of healthcare in terms of resources, effective cybersecurity defenses and policies have not moved as quickly.

The reality is that something must change, and it absolutely must start with leadership, then permeate through the entire workforce. In First Health's most recent white paper, ""Cyber Resilient Digital Health: Itâ€™s Not Just About Security Anymore"" EVP David Finn, outlines direct examples of the rise in patient safety impacts from healthcare cyberattacks and how healthcare leaders can move forward with cyber resilient digital health.

Engaging in philanthropy brings incredible benefits, from fostering a sense of purpose to improving personal well-being. It's not just about the act of giving; it's about building strong, supportive communities that drive long-term positive impact.

Some highlights include:
+ WisdomTree is closing in on $4 billion in model assets, up from $3.2 billion at the end of 2023.
+ Advisors and clients are largely wary of a single-issuer portfolio, weâ€™ve deliberately crafted our product set to include both our ETFs and nonproprietary products.
+ Customization at the model-level is one of the largest emerging trends within the spaceâ€”I think you'll also see growing interest in customized strategies within the sleeves of the models, such as direct indexing or tax-managed sleeves.
 
Our goal at WisdomTree is to serve financial advisors as their strongest partner by offering a full range of Portfolio Solutions to help manage their client portfolios.

Our first commercial deal in fusion magnets is with University of Wisconsin-Madison. We designed and built two high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets in a collaboration that began in 2019. Now weâ€™ve taken the major step of delivering and installing them at the universityâ€™s Physical Sciences Lab. Experiments should begin soon at WHAM â€” short for Wisconsin HTS Axisymmetric Mirror. From our fusion lab to theirs!

If you want to see some real-world fusion energy hardware, check out our video here of the unboxing of the two magnets.

We nicknamed the magnets Thing 1 and Thing 2, inspired by the twins in Dr. Seussâ€™ The Cat in the Hat. Theyâ€™re the high field â€œmirrorâ€ coils in WHAM, and hydrogen nuclei will bounce back and forth in a tube-shaped magnetic field between them. The magnetic mirror approach mostly fizzled decades ago, but our HTSÂ  superconducting electromagnets and some plasma physics breakthroughs mean theyâ€™re worthy of investigation again and ultimately could become a new path to fusion commercialization.

Which brings me to our magnet business. Our primary job is to build our own fusion machines, starting with the SPARC tokamak thatâ€™s under construction now at our headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts. But our expertise lets us help other parts of the fusion market, too, and better magnets make many approaches to confining a plasma and triggering fusion better.Â  We are pro-fusion, and thus we are pro-fusion magnets.

We delivered the magnets as a full, integrated package with cooling, instrumentation, and software to control them. The WHAM magnets were possible because of our abilities not just in manufacturing but also modeling, design, and testing, integration â€” all things we do for SPARC.

It was a learning experience for us, too. Some of the technology we developed for WHAM helped us with SPARC and other possible projects with other customers inside and outside fusion.

Speaking as a plasma physicist, itâ€™s fantastic to see this kind of progress in fusion energy again, enabled by new technology, better physics, and great partnerships. I have fond memories of working in the long-thin West Cell at MIT that was built to hold a long-thin mirror decades ago. Turns out, it was just ahead of its time and a bit short of HTS. 

Congratulations to the CFS team and our Wisconsin colleagues for building WHAM. Weâ€™re eager to see it up and running, and for the team to take it to the next phase!

Thanks James Hercher for capturing my key thoughts. Here are my top three:

1ï¸âƒ£ UberEats Ads is a multi-layered RMN: in one order, consumers start with restaurants (meal), move to CPG (drink/food they can add on top), and may finish with entertainment (movie?). There is a big opportunity for a synchronized experience, set of ad products, and GTM strategy.
2ï¸âƒ£ Uber Ads is a full-funnel, omnichannel platform: across two popular apps and CTV assets, users may go from food search to in-car tablet exposures during a ride, with touchpoints also in-app and offsite. Our deterministic audience and scale can serve multiple use cases.
3ï¸âƒ£ For RMNs, there is always a balance between ad monetization and the risk of sales loss. At UberEats, weâ€™re trying to elevate Ads from monetization-only to a business growth lever as well, i.e., how we fully leverage ads to accelerate our delivery flywheel.

If you have 3 minutes to read through, Iâ€™m curious to hear your thoughts on RMNs and where you think the next S-curve is coming from. For the best insight, Iâ€™ll buy you lunch in Miami or NYC ðŸðŸš—

And now it's officially time for me to include puns about time everywhere. So there's more of that coming in a hot minute.

Or maybe not, on second ðŸ˜¶ thought. ðŸš€

The rapid pace of innovation is creating unparalleled opportunities for designers to learn new skills, develop new interaction models, and bring value to businesses, customers and users in ways that weren't possible a few years ago.

With that said, Iâ€™m thrilled to share one of our most recent launches. Late last year, Amazon Connect launched Amazon Q in Connect, a generative AI assistant that uses conversational analytics and natural language processing (NLP) to automatically detect customer issues, provide agents real-time solutions, responses and recommended actions. Since then, weâ€™ve listened to customers, worked closely with our Product and Engineering partners and iterated on the experience. Our latest version of QiC has a more streamlined user experience with decreased latency, increased accuracy and a more simple UI. QiC also powers agents with step-by-step guides, an Amazon Connect experience that helps them solve end customer issues even more quickly, intuitively and accurately. And, thereâ€™s much more to come! 

While many people were involved in this launch, I want to thank Marta Guerra, Joy Li, Nicholas J. Zdravkovski and Sijie Yang for their customer obsession and rigorous attention to detail while bringing this new QiC experience to our customers. 

If you're a Product or UX Designer interested in the work the Amazon Connect UX team is doing with GenAI, weâ€™d love to hear from you. Weâ€™re hiring in Seattle and NYC!

They say time flies when youâ€™re having fun, and it turns out two decades isnâ€™t that long if you really enjoy your work. 
 
What Iâ€™ve learned really boils down to the work Iâ€™ve done and the hundreds and thousands of people Iâ€™ve connected with. Thatâ€™s the beauty of Infosys. Itâ€™s hard to sum it all up, but Iâ€™ll take a shot with 5 things that have stayed with me over the years.

1. Thereâ€™s always something exciting brewing. I like to think thatâ€™s because Infosys isnâ€™t just a technology company. The projects you get to work here are so diverse, everything from demystifying banking products to digitizing cross-word puzzles to AI analytics for tennis players to addressing scope 3 emission. Thereâ€™s no telling what youâ€™ll end up doing. You can start your career as a chemical engineer, but still find opportunities to work on the stuff youâ€™re most passionate about on a global scale. (I did).

2. Colleagues become friends, and over time, they start to feel like family. And itâ€™s not just your teams at Infosys, but also the partners you work with closely. Thereâ€™s camaraderie, and thereâ€™s the joy of seeing them grow with you over time. There will be many babies in your team, and eventually, theyâ€™ll have babies. I too, became a parent at Infosys, and thereâ€™s no feeling like your teammate bringing their newborn over to the office to meet you.

3. Thereâ€™s always something to learn, and someone to learn from. Be it a brief conversation with the co-founders or a tech architect youâ€™re working with on a project, you always leave a meeting feeling like youâ€™ve added more grey cells, and in my case, quite a few grey hairs too. A mid-life crisis might include packing a bag and going to college on a campus full of 20-somethings in Stanford to reconnect with academics. (I got through it).

4. It wonâ€™t feel like a job. At some point, youâ€™ll certainly feel like what you do is making a difference. In such a purpose-driven company, itâ€™s inevitable. There are few things so special as seeing social impact in action. Iâ€™ve witnessed the joy and hope that simple initiatives, like providing laptops and coding lessons, can bring to children and adults alike.

5. Sometimes, you'll pinch yourself to see if it's real. Because when you've stayed long enough, youâ€™ll realize how far you've come. The journey with the Infosys brand, from the early days of trade events and brochures to global forums on snowy mountains, stadiums, airports, and iconic figures showcasing your logo, has been truly fulfilling. Standing in Times Square, NYC, witnessing the campaign you've helped create and seeing the Infosys logo displayed prominently, you take a moment to look back with pride. (Next upâ€¦Las Vegas Sphere, Super Bowl adâ€¦why not? ðŸ˜Š)

So with much gratitude, a big thank you to Infosys, to everyone in it, and especially to my wonderful team (over the years). Itâ€™s been quite a ride. Thank you for the 20 years, and hereâ€™s to many more.

Today is my last day at Elevance Health. After nearly 3 decades and through many chapters with the company, beginning with the formation of HealthCore in 1996, being acquired by WellPoint in 2003, running HealthCore as a subsidiary and finally leading Elevanceâ€™s Enterprise Analytics Core as their Chief Analytics Officer, I am officially retiring. Through all of these periods, what has held true has been our commitment to our mission to improve healthcare outcomes by providing richer insights to those who have to make critical decisions impacting the patient. 

We have accomplished much over the last 28 years, but nothing has been more impactful to me than those with whom I have shared this adventure, the two most prominent being my wife, Diana, and my business partner, Mark Cziraky, who has been with me from the outset.Â To him, and the rest of the tremendously talented team I leave behind, I hand the task of completing mission.

Currie has spent her whole life helping the most vulnerable â€“ from fixing broken bird wings as a child to delivering and inspiring holistic bedside care for pediatric patients. After completing her training at the Kent School of Nursing, she found her purpose working in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) on both sides of the pond.

Dave Burritt, president and CEO of United States Steel Corporation is back with us to make the case for the company's combination with Nippon Steel Corporation.  He says the deal is in the best interest of all stakeholders, including employees and the communities where it operates. 

Karen Riley, the relatively new president of Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, will be in studio to talk about Rock Teach, an initiative to recruit, mentor and provide financial support to encourage minority students to become teachers -- and the largest planned estate gift in university history that's made it possible.

We're off to Morris Organic Farm in Irwin, Westmoreland County, to learn about a new side gig, hosting campers, that's bringing extra revenue to farmers and small businesses across our region and the country. Harvest Hosts COO Wesley Clark explains how his membership service makes it possible. 

Sadik Roberts is batting cleanup.  He's co-owner ofÂ Pyramid PGH, a husband/wife digital marketing firm and one of six small businesses selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates and PNC to receive $100,000 of free marketing support as part of their ongoing ""Going to Bat for Small Business"" program.Â Sadik says Pyramid PGH emphasizes community to set his agency apart.

After Sunday's broadcast, we'll be taking the next four weeks off, preempted by NBC Sports for the Paris Olympics and other programming.  See you again August 18th.

As promised, I'm back for more Qlik Connect Recap fun! This yearâ€™s event was packed with innovation, but one announcement truly stood out: The launch of QlikAnswers, a plug-and-play AI assistant.
 
Ask questions and get personalized, relevant answers sourced from unstructured content. With generative AI, you get actual answers instead of just ranked lists of content. And with full explainability, you get links to source content and highlighting so youâ€™ll know exactly where things come from.
 
Iâ€™m incredibly excited about the possibilities Qlik Answers brings and canâ€™t wait to see the positive impact it will have on businesses and data professionals worldwide.
 
Hereâ€™s to a future where data-driven insights are just a question away! ðŸŒŸ

Itâ€™s truly disheartening, and I can only imagine what that person feels inside. Leadership is such a tremendous responsibility because you have the influence to help someone become the very best version of themselves and, in the process, make a profound impact on their life.

Why would anyone take this for granted, especially when dealing with people?

Building confidence, mentoring, and coaching takes time and energy. Still, itâ€™s worth it, and if you can help somebody build their self-esteem and confidence, it will pay dividends for the person and the organization.

Ready to become a strategic advisor? Here's how...

In our recent posts, Brian Cariveau and I advocated for Business Intelligence staff to move towards becoming a strategic business advisor instead - but how do you start that journey? Here are some tips to get started:

ðŸ. ðð®ð¢ð¥ð ððžðžð© ðð¨ð¦ðšð¢ð§ ð¤ð§ð¨ð°ð¥ðžðð ðž ðŸ¤“: Know the business you serve and before you build your next report, be sure to know what questions it'll answer, and how knowing the answer can be tied to business value. 

ðŸ. ð‚ð¨ð¥ð¥ðšð›ð¨ð«ðšð­ðž ð°ð¢ð­ð¡ ð¬ð­ðšð¤ðžð¡ð¨ð¥ððžð«ð¬ ðŸ™: The job doesn't end when the dashboard is published - follow up regularly with users to find out if it's still useful and how it could be improved. (bonus: it's easier to improve than making an all-new dashboard later)

ðŸ‘. ðƒðžð¯ðžð¥ð¨ð© ðš ð©ð«ð¨ðšðœð­ð¢ð¯ðž ð¦ð¢ð§ðð¬ðžð­ ðŸ’¬: Armed with your domain knowledge and the conversations you've had with your stakeholders, you're in a much better position to anticipate questions/needs and can start proactively offering solutions. Be bold, it's not easy when you're used to working of a request-queue, but it's worth it. 

These simple steps are key because they shift your focus from simply fulfilling requests to actively shaping business outcomes. By understanding the business, collaborating with stakeholders, and developing a proactive mindset, you become an invaluable partner.

Bet on someone you just met.
 
Very early in my engagement on LinkedIn I wrote about the talented people that are seeking new professional challenges.Â That post occurred during the annual March Madness basketball tournament, and I reminded people that a lot of championships have been won by players coming off the bench.
 
I want to encourage those of you with the power to hire someone to look beyond the basics. 
 
I assure you that someone who lost a job due to no fault of their own has learned lessons that will make them a more dedicated employee. 
 
I assure you that a parent who took a break to take care of a premature baby will be forever grateful that you saw that as a sign of the quality of their character. 
 
I assure you that someone who had a few jobs over a couple of years isnâ€™t damaged goods, but rather gained a lot of self-awareness. 
 
I assure you that a student who didnâ€™t complete their degree, may have made the best decision for themselves and would be ideal for an apprenticeship. 
 
I know there are exceptions to every one of these, but I also know the dignity that comes with being gainfully employed. 
 
All I ask is that you look below the surface and, when the opportunity presents itself, make a bet on someone you just met.

It's an effort that is more efficient and fast than any of our previous major event restorations, but you wouldn't know that from criticism being leveled at the Company.
Yes, as an employee engaged in the response, I'm biased towards the great work being done, but I'm also a customer and there is nothing I would love more than to have power at my home.  I'm tired, and tired of being drenched in sweat trying to sleep after these long days, but I know that our folks are working around the clock to make that happen. 

One particularly galling observation from the peanut gallery is about our crews supposedly ""doing nothing.""  There are several reasons crews may look to be inactive. They may be documenting their recently completed work and reporting on progress to help get restoration estimates to customers. They may be in cue waiting for a crew ahead to finish their work so they can continue the work in an efficient manner. (For example, waiting on a cut and clear team or veg crew to finish). Finally, safety is the number one priority in this business, and these workers are outside working 16-hour days in this weather and need to take breaks to rest and rehydrate to stay healthy and safe.

When I reflect on what power comes from having a seat at the table, I think about the fact that I stand almost all day everydayâ€¦ so my seat is always available for someone else to join me.  I guess based on this example, where I find power is to share it, and that itâ€™s important to celebrate the fact that everyoneâ€™s journey is different. 

When I do sit, itâ€™s usually in an artist chair that allows for me to significantly adjust the height (I can use all the help I can get) to focus on work or creative projects. 

The most powerful seat I have, is in shaping my sonâ€™s perspective of what happy, healthy and successful looks like (and it is beautifully different for everyone).

Agent Donovan goes beyond summarization and chat. It brings new capabilities around reasoning and tool use, most critically:

1ï¸âƒ£ Kick off an agentic workflow that connects your data sources, identifies critical information, runs code, corrects code execution errors, and validates sources

2ï¸âƒ£ Leverage the skillsets of experts across various domains to execute workflows such as generating an ISR request for further intel by sharing insights with a report generation template

Donovan is ready to be deployed in secure classified environments for your team. Imagine what you can do with your own data today.

With the increase in severe weather conditions and our changing climate, it's even more important that we work together to grow our resilience.â€ In a new blog post, Alyssa Okamura, from our digital communications team, reflects on her experience at Hawaiian Electricâ€™s Wildfire Safety Symposium, held this past April in Hilo.

Wildfire safety experts from utilities, agencies, research institutes and the state were invited to this two-day technical symposium to focus on reducing Hawaiiâ€™s wildfire risk by sharing insights about collective actions to keep our communities safe and discussing immediate to long-term strategies for both safety and grid resilience. Panel discussions featured wildfire experts from around the world, with representatives from California, Australia, and Puerto Rico. Each of these organizations is at a different stage of wildfire safety planning and offered advice and insights from their own experiences.

Everyone was willing to share and learn from one another. The symposium was a space to collaborate and served as a platform for curiosity and clarification. When it comes to the safety of our customers and community, it was about uplifting each other so that everyone could keep their people safe.

â€œI also became more aware of how challenging the planning process for wildfire safety protocols and a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program can be,â€ writes Alyssa. â€œEveryoneâ€Šâ€”â€Šresidents, businesses, emergency responders, water companies, telecommunications providers âˆ’ will be impacted and thatâ€™s why it is so important to work together to prepare.â€

User cohorts are default standard in product teams. 

Yet, opportunity cohorts seems to be seldom used in revenue analytics, or?

Ofc, cohorts came with their own challenges, but are a good way to compare how opportunities created each week develop over time.

You can slice and dice them by e.g.:
- Lead source
- Industry
- Segment
- Territory

If referred to win rates, it can help answer questions like:
1. Has my win rate gone down/ up over time?

2. Are there severe differences by lead source, industry, territory, segment?

3. What can we learn

As we all live in fast changing environments, it's sometimes hard to pinpoint what has driven the change.

BUT, knowing that there has been a change is a good starting point.

Curious what you think?

PS: I know you love cohorts Robert Gimbel

Keith has been a Southern California Edison (SCE) groundman since Oct. 2023 and in 2021, was one of our 2021 Edison International Lineworker Scholarship recipients. 

I met Keith recently at SCEâ€™s Dominguez Hills Service Center. When asked why he wanted to be a lineworker, Keith said, â€œIt will allow me to learn a skill, master it, commit to a profession and maybe pass on my knowledge to the next generation.â€ Less than a year into his career at SCE, he is already living up to that aspiration by staying connected with the others from his Lineworker Scholar class and helping to support the current group of students in training. 

Thanks to Keith, our partners at IBEW Local 47, and all lineworkers who are powering our customersâ€™ lives today, and developing the linework craft for tomorrow.

Martina Biolo Magnus (SL 2020), Senior Director of Strategic Projects at Novo Nordisk, was initially drawn to IMDâ€™s Strategies for Leadership program by the female-focused curriculum, which aligned well with her desire to learn more about overcoming the leadership challenges specific to women in the workplace. 

""I signed up for the program because I wanted to work on areas that were aligned to my development plans in the company and I felt like I needed to find some more time for deeper reflection.â€ 

Two critical takeaways from the program, for Magnus, were the importance of feedback in building a healthy organizational culture and how self-awareness can contribute to developing assertiveness. 

â€œBeing assertive means being able to communicate with clarity and confidence respectfully. Itâ€™s recognizing the equal importance of your needs alongside those of others. Itâ€™s a critical skill many women can work on improving to ensure their perspectives are acknowledged.â€

Rural and critical access hospitals in the United States face many financial, employee retainment, and technology challenges, which is a heavy burden on cybersecurity. Recent cyber support offerings from Microsoft and Google provide limited help to these hospitals. While well-intentioned, they're unlikely to be a lasting solution. A more comprehensive, collaborative, and long-term approach is needed to address the underlying issues these hospitals face.

The new article, Cyber Support for Rural Healthcare: It's a Start, by Mac McMillan, Strategic Advisory Board Member, addresses ""turnkey solutions"" which go beyond software/products, to provide implementation, administration, and management support necessary to truly strengthen the resilience of the rural healthcare community.

Listening is a core aspect of leadership; many people in leadership positions donâ€™t listen, they may be hearing, but they are not listening.

I read an article this morning and thought the premise makes so much sense.

In our early life we are constantly asked and ask ourselves what we want to do for a career.  Our parents, in too many cases, raced through their early-chosen career choices to retire as soon as possible to escape to what they â€œwanted to doâ€, only to find a lack of meaning still.

Today, we all realize, particularly the youngest of us, that career paths are more like career adventures, certain to twist and turn and occasionally find they lead to new paths. From a teacher to a coach, business person to minister, banker to artist, anything to entrepreneur.

And the cool thing is that no one really limits any of us to a single path.  We can have multiple paths.  And â€œretirementâ€ as a term should probably be retired, because today it so often means a new career path or two.

I know so many of you who are reading this have already made one or two or three career path changes or addition.  Most of the rest of you will make a change or addition, too. 

If youâ€™ve taken the road less travelled already, good luck on more of themâ€¦ if not youâ€™ll surely find yourself on an exciting new path one day.  And if you simply love what you do so much you wouldnâ€™t spend a moment on another path, then Iâ€™m sure you are reinventing what even that path is.

Exciting adventures aheadâ€¦",1539,1412,100,27,3w,Roy Rosas likes this,,2024-07-14 21:49,Monday,1:49 AM,7/15/2024,1-2am,Monday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

I can say this with absolute certainty: The world is a lesser place without Geert Broos. 

In 1991 I embarked on a grand adventure, moving my young family to Morocco with Procter & Gamble.  My new boss was Geert.  Little did I know that beyond a boss, I would also gain a lifelong friend. And have the honour of knowing one of the most exceptional human beings ever. A person who truly embodied â€œA man for othersâ€. 

In 1992 I was touring the Sahara Desert with my family and brother Jerry Lafferty.  On a narrow road I had an accident, rolled the car 4x whilst my wife, sister-in-law, and daughters watched from the trailing vehicle in horror.  Everyone was injured but I was in a coma in the middle of the desert.  Who saved the day? Geert and his wife Ann Broos Delbrassine.  Geert dropped his whole life and boarded a plane to the closest city. He handled the police. Got me transferred to a hospital. Got the cars taken care of.  The next day he got us all airlifted back to Casablanca whilst he drove our one good car back. When we landed in Casablanca, Ann was waiting and got us to the hospital. 

Itâ€™s exceptional, but thatâ€™s who Geert and Ann Broos are. 

We went on to become lifelong friends and meeting up through the years.  This is all of us in a mini reunion in Casablanca in 2018. 

In the subsequent years I would occasionally find myself having to describe Geert to someone. We both were in Coca Cola together in the early 2010â€™s.  I can talk all night about the exceptional businessman Geert was, an amazing international career in both P&G and Coke.  I can share many stories of his exceptional athleticism, from running to squash to basketball.  I will let others talk about this. I want to focus on the man.  I would tell people this: 

â€œIf you take someone like me, you will find people who love me and people who hate me. I am polarising and I can be a real asshole. But Geert Broos? This is the finest man I have ever known, a person who gives himself and always puts others first.  If you donâ€™t love Geert Broos, quite frankly there is something wrong with you. Maybe some kind of brain damage perhapsâ€¦â€

The finest man I have known in my 61 years.  He is gone too soon after a courageous battle with cancer; and this world is a far lesser place without the perpetual smile and optimism of Geert Broos. 

Rest well my friend.  And thank you for being there for me.  I will be there for your family, whenever they need.

In the largest GOP Primary (by # voters) that is not a statewide race in Utah, we just WON the nomination with 58%! 

Thank you to everyone who helped GOTV, who has volunteered, donated, and spread the good word of Team Rachelle! This was a statement Primary win. 

The work is not done â€” in Salt Lake Countywide races, unaffiliated voters determine the outcomes of races between the two parties. Team Rachelle is positioned well for the General, and with this being the largest open seat race in Utah that is a true Purple race, Iâ€™ll be continuing to campaign across SLCo all the way up through Election Day in November. 

It means the world to have support from my family, my business partners, my broader professional network, the Governor and many elected officials across the state of Utah, and many folks Iâ€™ve met along the campaign trail. 

Iâ€™ve knocked on 1000+ doors across SLCo in the past two months. I love getting to know people I would have never met had I not decided to run for office. The more people I get to know, the more Iâ€™m convinced that Iâ€™m lucky to call SLCo my home, and the more Iâ€™m convinced that the Salt Lake Valley has the potential of being The Best metropolitan area in the West over the next 10 years. It would be an honor to bring my talents and skills and approach to solving problems to the County Council. 

Weâ€™ll be in parades and doing lots of community-focused events this summer. If you want to get involved, weâ€™d love to have you! And if you want to be plugged into frequent updates of my campaign, follow along on my Instagram account at @rachellemorrisut or Twitter at @rachelle_morris.

And before I wrap, I want to give special thanks to my core campaign team of Jordan Hess and Michael Jolley. Those were the two men I wanted to run Team Rachelle with me this year, and I know I hit the jackpot with this team.

Our mantra has always been 'Without happy drivers, we don't have happy customers and consequently a prosperous business'. Towards that goal: 

(a) Payments - We pay drivers the very next business day for all trips they completed before mid-night the prior day (vs. industry norm is reconciliation and payments made once a week). 
(b) Transparency - They know, how much the customer has paid and they are guaranteed 80% of trip earnings. 
(c) Predictable income - The DriveU team works really hard to ensure sufficient demand for drivers to earn enough in a month. See chart below (as a compare, an average Indian engineer with less than 3 years of experience earns â‚¹ 40,000/month - so this is pretty, pretty good... especially since it doesn't include tips!)

Organizing and executing this event was no small feat. It required nimble planning across multiple venues, coordination among dozens of speakers and guests, and a tenacious commitment to excellence from our GOST team. Despite all the challenges we have faced, we have received great positive feedback, and the experience has been very rewarding.

As Substation Safety Lead, I had the honor of training over 125 colleagues on the importance of safety culture and the hierarchy of controls, with the help of James Hopkins, EIT. Seeing the engagement and enthusiasm from participants has reaffirmed the value of these initiatives.

We were especially fortunate to have senior-level directs and vice presidents join us, engaging us and our audience. Joe Bentley's & Raj Beasla, MBA presence and support underscored the importance of safety at every level of our organization.

The training event has not only enhanced our knowledge and skills but has also had a significant positive impact on our company safety culture and engagement. The collective effort and dedication of everyone involved has strengthened our commitment to creating a safety workplace for all.

A huge thanks to all who participated, contributed and volunteered to making this event a success. There are many names that I want to mention, but I cannot possibly fit them all into this post! But here are some special thanks to Sujean Wu, P.E., S.E., PMP Shahneam Reza, PE Jose Jiminez Jr, Nick Johnson Samantha Estrella Brit Gage Safwa Ali James Hopkins, EIT John Villalpando Khalid Tarar Josue Martinez, PE, PMP, Lean-6Ïƒ Jairo Ballesteros

Huge congrats to our Atwater and Eastwood solar siteÂ teamsÂ at our Aurora solar farm.
 
These Minnesota sites are truly special. They've hosted a 5-year agrivoltaics field study by the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory with support from MNL. We saw some incredible results: 3x increase in insect abundance, 20x increase in native bee populations and an uptick in plant diversity. 
 
Enel pioneered some of the first â€œecovoltaicsâ€ practices at Aurora several years ago. Today, weâ€™re honored to have set a new benchmark for the integration of solar power and ecosystem services. 

Renewables and sustainable land use arenâ€™t mutually exclusive â€”Â we can say that with confidence.Â ðŸ

These events emphasised the importance of mentoring, the power of networking, and strategies for overcoming imposter syndrome. Watch out for our future events with several more universities.

ðŸŒŸ **Katapult Konnect:** We successfully launched our mentoring programme, Katapult Konnect, designed to connect students with industry professionals and provide valuable guidance.

ðŸŒŸ **Work Experience Day with F5:** We organised an enriching work experience day in collaboration with F5, giving students a glimpse into the professional world and valuable hands-on experience.

ðŸŒŸ **Career Advice Workshops:** Together with Birmingham City University, we held many career advice workshops, equipping students with the tools and knowledge to navigate their career paths.

ðŸŒŸ **Student experience day with one of the UKâ€™s most luxurious car makers:** showcasing the diverse career opportunities in the automotive industry.

ðŸŒŸ **Support from Cognizant:** Our valued sponsor, Cognizant, has generously funded our programs, enabling us to reach and support even more young people.

And this is just the beginning! Stay tuned for a big announcement this week that we can't wait to share with you all. ðŸš€

Thank you to everyone who has supported us on this incredible journey. Here's to many more years of making a difference together!

â†’ Clinicians expected to use the tech far more than they actually could 

(e.g. for remote monitoring, assuming providers both want and are able to monitor every single data point recorded by a patient)

â†’ Prioritizing shiny tech instead of providing a real solution that fits the clinical workflow 

(e.g. providing AI predictive insights that no clinician uses because thereâ€™s no existing workflow where it makes sense to use the insight)

â†’ Disruption of day to day clinical workflows that will lead to low user adoption 

(e.g. assuming frontline staff have endless hours to manually enter data into your system)

â†’ Providing a â€œshell productâ€ where clinicians must spend hundreds of hours creating clinical content from scratch for each surgery, health condition, etc.

â†’ Patient education is at too high of a reading level.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve learned embracing change and constantly reinventing oneself is key to staying relevant and finding fulfillment ðŸš€ (as a friend used to say 'Lets not be Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite')

Hard work has been my constant companion no doubt. But taking calculated risks has been the game-changer for me. Stepping out of my comfort zone and not just priding myself on 'DOING' the work, but now writing about it (eeek!).
To everyone out there hustling, dreaming, and striving for more ðŸŒŸ â€“ keep pushing. 

Hereâ€™s to new beginnings (more announcements coming soon), endless possibilities, and the unwavering belief in the collective  potential. Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way. June 2023 thru June 2024 has been an exciting journey so far! ðŸš€âœ¨

See below for my 1st article ... would LOVE the support.

A 58 year old heathy man was seen at Lake Men's Health clinic for a routine annual physical exam. His lab tests were perfectly normal. Specifically he had a normal cholesterol level of 188 with an LDL of 120. 

His family history was significant in that his father suffered a heart attack at age 62.

He related to us that he had been living a healthy lifestyle, eating very little red meat, watching his carb intake, and working out 5 days per week in a Cross Fit Gym. His body fat was below 10%. 

His plan was to never suffer the heart problems that his father did.

Because of his family history of premature coronary artery disease, we recommended he undergo a coronary artery calcium test. This simple 12 minute CT scan identifies the presence or absence of coronary artery plaque by identifying coronary artery calcium. 

As a reminder, a ""normal"" coronary artery calcium level is ""0."" A score of 100 indicates minimal plaque. A score of 400 indicates the presence of severe coronary artery plaque.

Our patient's coronary artery calcium score was 914 (see below), with the majority of his plaque in the Left Anterior Descending coronary artery (widow-maker lesion) and in the Right Coronary artery.

He was promptly referred to a cardiologist. Fortunately his stress test was negative. He is currently on aggressive medical treatment and will be monitored closely by his cardiologist for any progression of his disease.

It has been so rewarding to work with incredibly talented colleagues and clients and it was also all-consuming, hard work. Having now aged out of our partnership terms It feels like gaining new freedom. It's like I stepped out of one door, closed it behind me, and 1,000 more re-opened: serving on boards, working with startups, recording music, producing a documentary, speaking gigs, sailing, time with my wife to hang out and enjoy life. I've already started teaching at the University of Southern California's Iovine and Young Academy (innovation school) and who knows, maybe another book following ""Big Ideas"" will be in the works at some point too. 

I've had the amazing opportunity to get to know Chip Conley and the MEA team over the las 2-3 years. He was founder and CEO of a chain of hotels that he sold to a larger company and then joined AirBnB early as a ""wisdom worker"" to extend beyond a rental listing website to a hospitality and lifestyle brand. Now he has founded MEA Wisdom to empower others in making the shift from the full-time corporate grind into the freedom of a whole life. I'm so grateful for MEA and Chip's team for showing the path. 

As a kid I remember watching the movie ""Trading Places"" and at the end, the vision for freedom and the good life was captured between Eddie Murphy's and Dan Aykroyd's characters. As one goes sailing by on a boat and the other is on the beach, they toast each other...
""Looking good, Billy Ray!"" 
""Feeling good, Louis!"" 

Here's an article I guest published with Chip that goes a bit deeper on making the shift and feeling good!

Athletes & busy professionals need to pay attention to their morning and night routines.

Having a Game Plan for these routines will drive productivity throughout the day.

Educating my athletes in these areas was a very challenging part of my role in athletics. Especially with 18-22 year olds and the demands associated with high level athletics. 

But when they applied these concepts into their daily routines, their performance in the class room, and in training, improved significantly. 

Watching them compete and win on game day, after dialing in their lifestyle Game Plan was extremely rewarding. 
Here are a few simple to follow rules to start applying right away:

ðŸŒ¤ï¸Morning sunlight as soon as you wake
â˜•ï¸Limit caffeine upon waking
ðŸ“±Turning off the screens leading up to bed
ðŸ’¡Dim lights at night 
ðŸ›€Hot bath/shower 1 hour before sleep 
ðŸ›Œ Bat cave bedroom 

Win your day, to win your night.

This will positively impact your training, nutrition, stress levels, and relationships.

Win your day, win your night, win your life.",76,65,7,4,4w,Drew Bernstein likes this,,2024-07-16 01:50,Tuesday,5:50 AM,7/16/2024,5-6am,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

These AI agents can sense and think like human brain and call variety of tools whenever required. Through AI inference technique, they can even learn without having to train them with the data. How amazing.

They even have the memory capability so they understand the past history to make future predictions. Amazing to see where AI industry is headed towards with these AI agents.

What if teams couldn't hire if psych safety levels were below a certain level?

This is a fascinating thought experiment. 

The cynical me, believes that magically, somehow, the #s would go up. Magically, psychological safety levels would be reported as high. This could happen for a number of reasons, including people thinking ""Unless these #s go up, we will not hire people, and I am overloaded!""

But other things. Say the # was low. Would that cause an immediate blame game? If psychological safety is low, it is perhaps unreasonable to imagine that the team would be able address the issue to improve the #s. 

Or you could imagine a situation where the team and its leaders were doing its best, and the issue was somewhere else, somewhere higher. I doubt that would get worked out.

For Mars, it is dramatically changing how we evolve and transform our business. To keep pace with this change, we need a relentless focus on skills and capabilities to match. 
 
As part of these efforts, we are marking a significant milestone in our journey towards digital transformation - the establishment of our Mars Petcare Digital Advisory Board.â€¯Comprising experts from industry, policy, and academia, it will bring valuable insights and challenge our thinking in this space. 
 
But what does this mean for our Associates? It means having the opportunity to learn at pace from some of the industryâ€™s best and brightest, build on a strong foundation of growth and harness the power of this insight and experience to make a real difference to pets and the people who care for them.

It was a once in a lifetime experience for me and one which I treasure even more given my Greek heritage. It proved a powerful reminder of the spirit of unity and perseverance that defines the Olympic Games. 
Just as the Olympic & Paralympic Games bring together people from all walks of life, at Sanofi, we are working every day to be a company that is reflective of the people and communities we serve. As a member ofÂ the Sanofi Executive Committee and the @Sanofi DE&I board, I am committed to building a culture of representative leadership and fostering an environment where our people can bring their best selves to work.
I am also proud that Sanofi is leveraging its partnership with the Games to support others in their quest to make an impact on society and want to give a special shoutout to my friend Dany Dann from Team Sanofi who I will be cheering on from the sidelines in just a few days.
And now I am passing the baton to Isabelle Demolin, Hedia Habassi and Emmanuelle MarieÂ who will be the next Sanofi torchbearers.

We're thrilled to unveil our new provider search for 27 million commercial members, a result of a two-year collaboration across 40 teams, designed to help members easily locate relevant, high-quality, and cost-effective care.
 
Over seven years ago, my wife faced challenges during her pregnancy and we were confronted with the harsh reality of navigating in-network and out-of-network providers, which led to unexpected financial burdens. This experience was a wakeup call which sparked a personal commitment: No one should have to sacrifice their dreams while caring for a loved one. Healthcare should be simple, straightforward, and supportive.
 
The new provider search experience is live for both web and app and includes:

ðŸ” ðŸ‘ª Member-specific search: Members can now search for care tailored to specific family members, ensuring personalized healthcare solutions.

ðŸ’¡ðŸ§  Claims-aware search: Leverages AI and ML to surface the most relevant providers based on the services they provide, streamlining the search process.

ðŸ‘¨ðŸ½â€âš•ï¸x ðŸ‘©ðŸ¾â€âš•ï¸ Side-by-side provider comparison tool: This allows members to compare providers based on their preferences, making informed decisions easier than ever.

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Patient reviews powered by Healthgrades: Gain insights from other patients to help choose the right provider.

ðŸ’²Integrated cost estimates: Provides financial clarity on services provided by different healthcare professionals.

ðŸ¥‡Best match search logic and enhanced filters: Surface the highest value and most cost-efficient providers, optimizing healthcare spending.

ðŸ©º PCP selector: Helps members find and manage their primary care providers for themselves and their dependents.

ðŸ—ºï¸ ðŸ“Map view: An interactive map to search for providers, helping members find convenient care options.

ðŸ“§ ðŸ–¨ï¸ Share, print, and download provider feature: Offers flexibility in how members can use and share provider information.

Thank you, UHC members, for your trust and for being part of our family. Your health is our priority, and we're honored to enhance your experience with new features on the UHC app and myuhc.com.

We appreciate every team member's role in this milestone. While listing all 300+ contributors isn't possible here, I wanted to thank key individuals.

I want to believe that we also changed her life as she has a family: we take care of her and love her so much. The #humananimalbond is real and it is strong!

Unfortunately, many pets are still waiting in shelters to find a home. Iâ€™m very proud of the work we do at Zoetis, and of our purpose to nurture our world and humankind by advancing care for animals. As part of our exclusive partnership announced last year, Adopt-a-Pet.com recently announced a new round of grant recipients to receive Zoetis products. These treatments and preventatives will help ensure shelter pets around the United States stay happy, healthy and ready for adoption! 

How are you living your purpose this summer?

Fast forward to 2016, that dream became a reality when I moved to the UK. For the last 8 years I've had the privilege of working alongside some of the most talented individuals in the industry, many of whom have become great friends. Together, weâ€™ve created countless memories within the walls of this remarkable building.

Now, as we prepare to transition to our new GSK Headquarters Building in central London, I can't help but feel a mix of nostalgia and excitement which marks the beginning of a new chapter. 

Here's to all the amazing experiences at GSK House and to the exciting future that awaits us in our new home! ðŸŒŸ

At Kenvue, we earn trust with science, and this new light texture moisturizer is now available exclusively in Germany and the United Kingdom. 
 
So, what's in it to make this all work? Vitamin C, E, and B3 vitamins strengthen the skin barrier, induce collagen production, and help to prevent visible aging. It alsoÂ delivers 12 hours of deep hydration and SPF50 protection without any white residue.
 
Hydration boosters provide all-day hydration, with hyaluronic acid working together with collagen fibers to make skin softer, firmer and more uniform, as well as panthenol, capable of attracting water molecules to prevent the skin from losing water, and glycerin which goes beyond the superficial into deeper layers to ensure smooth skin.
 
All that in one product! Weâ€™re proud of these innovations and consumers agree, with 98% reporting more hydrated skin. Have you added SPF protection to your routine?

This week, Houston Methodist Cypress (HMCY) leaders had the privilege of visiting our Ion hub to learn about the thought and stewardship that has gone into bringing industry-leading technologies to the forefront of the care we will be providing in our community. 
As always, the patient is our focus. The goal of leveraging these innovations is for caregivers to spend more time with our patients and their families to provide an unparalleled healthcare experience.

Also fabulous to see our National Grid 400kV substation at Drax, connecting customers ðŸ”Œ Big thank you to Chris Orr for organising a fantastic day of learning! 

5 fun facts today :

âš¡ï¸Drax have their own trains and a direct to site railway line that transports all the biomass wood pellets in to site, this biomass comes all the way from the US and Canada

âš¡ï¸The circulating water that is output underneath the large cooling towers is around 30 degrees, a lovely warm shower temperature - wonder if there are any waste heat harnessing opportunities here!

âš¡ï¸Although Drax has shifted away from coal combustion, the left over pulverised coal ash is now providing environmental net gain benefits as a nature reserve, sustainability is more than just decarbonisation!

âš¡ï¸Drax store about a weekâ€™s worth of generation wood pellets on site, reserving about ~25MW of the electricity they generate to power their site operations

âš¡ï¸The biomass storage dome facilities were constructed by inflating the same material that is used in bouncy castles, and it was inflated outwards, creating a door for construction operations to enter inside the inflated dome and reinforce the dome with steel and concrete",144,139,5,0,3w,Sander Cohan loves this,,2024-07-16 17:48,Tuesday,9:48 PM,7/16/2024,9-10pm,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,"Innovation, Product Development, Transactions"

Thatâ€™s the equivalent of over 6.4 million consumed barrels of oil. The latest Eversource Energy Sustainability Report highlights our organizational focus on ESG and the on-the-ground efforts for getting it done: 
 
Our Massachusetts Main Streets program for small businesses deployed 60% of its 2023 events in Environmental Justice communities; our smart thermostat ConnectedSolutions program grew by 27% last year and engagedÂ over 60,000 customers in demand response;Â and our net zero new construction programs enrolled 33 net zero or net zero ready, ultralow energy use new buildings, representing over 3.7 million square feet of space. 
 
Beyond EE, this report shares some important Eversource-wide initiatives, including how our Grid Modernization team is implementing measures to dynamically manage an increasingly complex power grid. It also outlines the efforts of our Solar team to support more than 160,000 Eversource customers who installed over 2,600 MW of customer-sited solar by the end of 2023. 
 
Iâ€™m grateful to work alongside so many talented individuals powering these significant improvements, including Brandy A. Chambers, Jennifer Gray, Katherine W. Peters, Nelson Medeiros, CEM, Richard Kazarian, Ron Araujo, and Stephen Bruno. Read more here about how weâ€™re driving towards a #cleanenergy future: https://lnkd.in/e4WpQnae

5ï¸âƒ£ Always sell your cash flow impact first

6ï¸âƒ£ No matter how compelling your financials, you are asking them to start a project that is not in their operating plan, now, therefore the burden falls on you to articulate the scope, work breakdown, stakeholder requirements and critical path...this is the second of their two critical decisions if this is going to work

7ï¸âƒ£ Companies must allocate their capital to intermediate/long term assets to ensure that growth and shareholder/stakeholder value are optimized...SaaS can and must be sold this way if you want to source and close strategic revenue

We're thrilled to unveil our new provider search for 27 million commercial members, a result of a two-year collaboration across 40 teams, designed to help members easily locate relevant, high-quality, and cost-effective care.
 
Over seven years ago, my wife faced challenges during her pregnancy and we were confronted with the harsh reality of navigating in-network and out-of-network providers, which led to unexpected financial burdens. This experience was a wakeup call which sparked a personal commitment: No one should have to sacrifice their dreams while caring for a loved one. Healthcare should be simple, straightforward, and supportive.
 
The new provider search experience is live for both web and app and includes:

ðŸ” ðŸ‘ª Member-specific search: Members can now search for care tailored to specific family members, ensuring personalized healthcare solutions.

ðŸ’¡ðŸ§  Claims-aware search: Leverages AI and ML to surface the most relevant providers based on the services they provide, streamlining the search process.

ðŸ‘¨ðŸ½â€âš•ï¸x ðŸ‘©ðŸ¾â€âš•ï¸ Side-by-side provider comparison tool: This allows members to compare providers based on their preferences, making informed decisions easier than ever.

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Patient reviews powered by Healthgrades: Gain insights from other patients to help choose the right provider.

ðŸ’²Integrated cost estimates: Provides financial clarity on services provided by different healthcare professionals.

ðŸ¥‡Best match search logic and enhanced filters: Surface the highest value and most cost-efficient providers, optimizing healthcare spending.

ðŸ©º PCP selector: Helps members find and manage their primary care providers for themselves and their dependents.

ðŸ—ºï¸ ðŸ“Map view: An interactive map to search for providers, helping members find convenient care options.

ðŸ“§ ðŸ–¨ï¸ Share, print, and download provider feature: Offers flexibility in how members can use and share provider information.

Thank you, UHC members, for your trust and for being part of our family. Your health is our priority, and we're honored to enhance your experience with new features on the UHC app and myuhc.com.

We appreciate every team member's role in this milestone. While listing all 300+ contributors isn't possible here, I wanted to thank key individuals.

The Latina to Latina fireside chat featuring Sandra Velasquez is quite inspiring. She started Nopalera four years ago and her mindset of â€œWealth is in our mindâ€ keeps moving her company forward. She also shares her experience of having the confidence to raise capital and how that confidence - acting as if you already have money - gave her access to investors. 

I initially met Sandra when she participated in the LBAN/Latino Business Action Networkâ€™s business scaling program. To see her progress is amazing! 

Great lessons for Latina entrepreneurs!

No surprises here: Record revenue and YoY growth, a tremendous influx of new customers that have trusted our team and mission, the launching of several strategic/high-growth partnerships such as NVIDIA and several notable Cloud Security market leaders, the continued support from an enterprise-class professional services and managed services team, and the execution from our exceptional field sales and marketing teams that operate with transparency, teamwork and a passion for the overall customer experience. 

Weâ€™ve continued to build a world-class Innovation team of industry technology leaders that have launched an impressive GTM in the Generative AI space to help productivity, support and empower our customers along their extraordinary AI journeys ahead. Weâ€™ve exceeded revenue growth expectations with a well-balanced portfolio across our core technology pillars, specifically Next Gen Data Center, Enterprise Networking, Security, Microsoft Consulting and ServiceNow; providing our customer's with a truly unified platform of services. And we've doubled-down on our geographic expansion initiative to move southeast, with our recent Tri State expansion as the blueprint for future success. 

Aside from the historic individual and team performances, our mission remains clear: Continue to surround our customers with A+ customer service and go the extra mile. There are many â€œvendorsâ€ in the channel community, but being a proactive, informative, and trustworthy business partner is unique. One that cares and values the transformation and success of their customers, while considered an extension of their collective team(s) has been the key to our success. 
 
Thank you to all of our incredible customers and business partners. Thank you to our Executive Team and all of our great employees, as it takes a full roster to fuel the rocketship, and the credit goes to all of you. Looking forward to continuing this run in the 2nd Half!

At every stage of our growth, this investor community has embraced the vision, supported me and the team and advocated for the brand in every part of their daily lives.

And as we line-up this next round of funding to accelerate things further, I just felt compelled to say the most hearty THANK YOU to all that have fueled our tanks, counseled our progress and given us the confidence to believe that maybe, just maybe, this wasnâ€™t such a crazy idea after all.

Blades moved from Panama to New York City in 1974 to pursue a music career. He began in the mailroom at Fania Records and later became a noted songwriter and singer for Ray Barretto and Larry Harlow. His groundbreaking album Siembra, featuring Blades' signature song ""Pedro Navaja,"" was released with Willie ColÃ³n in 1978. Siembra remains one of the best-selling salsa albums of all time and a cornerstone of the genre.

But Blades' talents don't stop at music! He holds a law degree and has made significant strides as an actor, appearing in films and TV shows like ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" and ""Fear the Walking Dead."" He even ventured into politics, running for the presidency of Panama in 1994 and serving as the country's Minister of Tourism from 2004 to 2009.

It's a BIG difference.

There's nothing wrong with making profits and it probably brings some healthy competition to the performance digital space, but it does raise the question of how the RMN space grows and sustains in the coming years if its only about maximizing profit? 

These networks may or may not realize it, but they are kind of getting into the publishing game. Some of that profit needs to be invested in to audience building tactics to drive growth and engagement on their properties. Otherwise RMNs simply become a play to harvest intent focused ad dollars with text ads. That will exhaust fairly quickly.

In short, if 'everything is an ad network', what does that mean for the experience of digital consumers?

From eradicating poverty and hunger to providing quality education, the world has ambitious targetsâ€”the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)â€”to achieve by 2030. 

As of 2024, with only six years remaining, weâ€™re on track to meet just 15% of these goals. Around 750 million people currently face hunger, and 2.2 billion people lack access to safe water and hygiene.

A recent report by McKinsey & Company highlights AIâ€™s potential to help achieve the SDGs. Early-stage health diagnosis or optimized food distribution are just a few areas where AI can make a significant impact.

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ¼AI already has a considerable presence in the social sectors: 66% of not-for-profit organizations use AI, and 80% believe they would benefit from more. 
ðŸ‘‰ðŸ¼ 72% state that most efforts to deploy AI for social good have centered on research and innovation.
ðŸ‘‰ðŸ¼ Organizations aiming to scale AI face challenges, including #data quality and accessibility (73%), talent availability (48%), and organizational receptiveness (43%). 

We can address these challenges through effective collaboration, creating high-quality data sets, and developing #digital public goods, such as software, standards, and content.

The potential risks and rewards of AI are two sides of the same coin. However, the substantial increase in its use cases positions AI as a key enabler.

Every day, weâ€™re proud to be part of the New Jersey community, so itâ€™s a special honor to receive this recognition from a local organization like NJBIZ. Thanks to all who power J&J with digital technology and who will continue to drive our mission forward.

From leading the pet food categoryÂ since 1935 to a business like no other in the consumer space - that spansÂ specialty and therapeutic nutrition, primary and specialty care, veterinary and at-home diagnostics, and digital platforms. 
 
Time to stop and celebrate? No way! We have only scratched the surface of transforming the experience of pet ownership. So, what do we do now?Â Accelerate. 

To move faster, build cheaper and make bigger, we need an even better use of end-to-end digital capabilities. I am excited about our new Digital Advisory Board that will support this journey. A group of rockstars from across industry, policy and academia that are going to bring guidance, experience and a lot of challenge. Looking forward to partnering with Amy Landucci, Benedetto Conversano, Lily Cheng, Marc Speichert, Nathan Furr, Saj-nicole Joni,  Ph.D. alongside Loic Moutault, Erica Coletta, Ikdeep Singh, Christoph Heyn and Romain Apert (he/him).

In many ways, I grew up there. 

Following the acquisition of 24/7 Real Media in 2007, I would spend the next ten years in the group - learning, building, innovating, making mistakes, and ultimately achieving great things. I became a pretty good product manager, a first-time CEO, and a successful media executive. Along the way, I came to admire the culture of invention, drive, client focus, and collaboration at GroupM.

In equal measure, I gained perspective during seven years outside the group. I worked for the worldâ€™s largest telco, and was part of a now epic transformation of AT&T. I became a seller instead of a buyer. I built and ran a pre-revenue technology company, with all of the thrills and challenges that are unique to startups. This time was invaluable.

The core purpose remained unchanged: building innovative businesses that drive marketing and advertising forward.

I am thrilled to return to GroupM as Global CEO.

There is no better place to innovate, do great work, learn from clients and colleagues, and help the worldâ€™s largest advertisers navigate an ever-changing media landscape. Thank you to Mark Read and the WPP board for this awesome opportunity. Thank you to Christian Juhl for laying a great foundation and for a seamless handover.

To my soon-to-be colleagues at GroupM, EssenceMediacom, Mindshare, Wavemaker, choreograph, and Nexus, I canâ€™t wait to work with you! I start on September 15.

It was a fascinating trip, particularly given the impact that the young, vibrant population is having on consumer trends and spending with the rise of K-culture and content. Korean music, movies, cuisine, design and cosmetics are growing in popularity and influence, not just locally but around the world. These Korean consumer goods and content are being amplified by social media and are increasingly being sold through e-commerce platforms. For Haleon, there are many learnings for us to take from this, with South Korea being the market holding the greatest e-comm share of business, and easily demonstrating how cultural trends can shape consumer behaviours across multiple sectors and markets.
 
Thank you Mari Nogami, @Charlie Shin, and the full Haleon Korea team for showing us around and giving us such a warm welcome!",491,488,2,1,1w,Amy Landucci likes this,,2024-07-17 16:22,Wednesday,8:22 PM,7/17/2024,8-9pm,Wednesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

As a proud ally and advocate of the LGBTQIA+ community, I want to wish everyone a happy Pride as celebrations continue across the world in the coming weeks and months.

It has been inspiring to witness so many of colleagues at Haleon come together over the last month to celebrate. Their efforts to promote awareness and foster a deeper understanding of the ongoing challenges faced by the community donâ€™t go unnoticed. As a new business weâ€™re very much at the beginning of our journey and thereâ€™s more for us to do, but weâ€™re committed to nurturing an inclusive environment where every individual feels valued, understood, and treated equitably.

My passion for the impact we can achieve, both collectively and individually, is unwavering. It requires continuous action and active allyship, which involves engaging in meaningful conversations, confronting biases, seeking knowledge, and celebrating our diverse viewpoints. 

Iâ€™m incredibly proud of all four of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) dedicated to gender, ethnicity, LGBTQIA+ and disability. The members, in addition to their regular roles, go above and beyond to positively impact the lives of colleagues worldwide and contribute to empowering our employees and sparking further transformation.

Letâ€™s take a moment to celebrate and appreciate the strides weâ€™ve made and the strides we will continue to make. Together, we stand in solidarity, not just during Pride Month but throughout the entire year.

ðŸ’² Raised $3.25M to keep up with demand and build the platform to enable service delivery at a tremendous scale
ðŸš€ 8 figure revenue run rate, more than doubling year over year (and accelerating)

As a refresher, Tribe is an AI-native services company that helps Enterprises build best in class AI products. Our team is augmented by a talent network of over 500 top AI engineers from places like Google, Tesla, Meta and OpenAI who bring both industry and deep technical specialization to our project deployments. These are the people who have built the infrastructure that is powering the AI wave and know it better than anyone. 

After bootstrapping Tribe AI since 2019, we decided to raise this capital because the market opportunity was simply too big. Even as we were reinvesting our profits back into the business, we still saw more demand than our capacity could support. Weâ€™re grateful to have met Bryce and have him believe in us and the opportunity we saw. Weâ€™re also extremely proud to have the major stakeholders in our business (our customers, partners and network of top AI engineers) invest in the round as well.

1. Got honest about my personal trajectory and how many times I could gamble (potentially lose) and have to go back. At 42 years old I decided it was once so I better hurry. 

2. Assed my career momentum. It was speeding up and quickly arriving at the point of no-return (ie., in a few years' time it will be much harder to walk away from my comp and title).

3. Cost of living. I wanted to dedicate 1 year to the startup so I figured out how much bare bones expenses I had to cover. I was surprised at how low that number felt to me (about $80k) and that got me really excited.

If you're interested, here are 3 things I learned in those 2 years:

1. Shawshanked - Just like Brooks and Redd when they get out of prison, life outside the corporate world actually made less sense to me. Being ""inside"" gave me structure, a community, and a feeling of belonging that I didn't know I would miss. I went from hundreds of emails and 8 hours of meetings a day to....nothing. Silence. It was a crushing loss of purpose that I never expected.

2. Lost at Sea - I love the phrase ""to discover new worlds you must first lose sight of the shore"". It's extremely romantic. But it's actually terrifying to no longer have any measurable feedback or response to your efforts. We laugh at performance review culture, but man, I had no idea how disorienting it would be to lose consistent feedback. Or how lonely. 

3. Time - I would have, and literally did, trade hundreds of thousands of dollars for more time. Then all of a sudden I had too much of it. So much, that all the opportunities and possibilities that came with it imploded and collapsed on themselves as I experienced an almost crippling sense of being overwhelmed by them. Like all resources, value is often a function of scarcity. 

This really all boils down to one lesson: learning to live with myself. I have to learn to be alone, to be proud of my efforts despite no external barometer of whether they matter. Maybe that's the real success?

It's their hobby and passion, so weekends and holidays were spent bringing it to life. Watching their progress has been fascinating, and the first test drive left me speechless.

âœ… You might notice the BMW M5 in the background, a project now in its fourth year, which they plan to complete over the next year. But this post is all about the Maserati.

âœ… About the Car: This is a 2011 Maserati Quattroporte Sport GTS, the highest performance version of the 5th generation Quattroporte, and the only generation designed directly with influence from the legendary Luca Di Montezemolo. The late model year Gen 5 Quattroportes feature a wet sump 4.7L cross-plane crank version of the V8 from the Ferrari California and F430, internally designated as the F136. The Sport GTS boasts unique visual touches such as red accents on badges, oval exhaust tips, and special interior details. Mechanically, it has a louder exhaust, more reliable Bilstein coilovers, and 10 extra horsepower.

âœ… Maserati produced only 1,847 of these cars, making them extremely rare. Our car stands out even more with its Cuoio interior, as most Sport GTS models typically had black interiors. My son and husband repaired the AC and updated the head unit to include Apple CarPlay. They also replaced many interior components that the previous owner had tampered with.

âœ… One production this vehicle has starred in was *The Intouchables*. It featured this exact model and was part of what inspired this vehicleâ€™s purchase along with Jason Cammisa video on the Hagerty YouTube channel over this model. Overall, the elegance, power, and exotic underpinnings combined with a beautiful Pininfarina designed styling make the 5th generation Maserati Quattroporte a true legend.

Does the world need another agency?Â No. 
But it absolutely needs one that leverages the full potential of AI, boosted by the expertise of seasoned professionals!

Next Wave Worldwide stands forÂ ""Human Expertise amplified by Artificial Intelligenceâ€.Â We're not an AI company. While our proprietary AI engines do power our back-end, it is human expertise that truly unlocks value for marketers and advertisers. 

Why is this important?Â Expertise is indispensable. Itâ€™s the proverbial key to unlocking the true potential of AI-Â thatâ€™s what the visual represents.

Why do we exist?Â To prove, contrary to popular notion, thatÂ Agility, Quality and AffordabilityÂ can indeed coexist.

McKinsey's values deeply resonate with me. Their commitment to positive, lasting change, maintaining the highest professional standards, and cultivating an inclusive culture is truly inspiring.

Together, we are striving to redefine leadership in Corporate America by harnessing our collective influence to not only drive business success but also to create meaningful societal change.

In the beginning, it was a school project at CentraleSupÃ©lec, with just a few of us working in a cold, windowless printing shop in the basement of the ESCP Business School, trying to create something that would make users' digital lives easier.

When we first set out, we weren't looking to create a password manager. Our first idea was a virtual personal assistant which would automate tasks online such as monitoring your bank account or making purchases. As we were working on different prototypes, we realized that we had to be very focused in order to do one thing well, instead of many things poorly.

We also realized that the tasks we wanted to automate all started with authentication, so we eventually honed in on password management. This netted us $5M in Series A funding. This was a lot back then, or at least we thought.

In those early days, the pace of work was frenetic. We were coding from morning until night, and on weekends. We pushed a lot of code to production at once, and things broke. But it's that pace of innovation which allowed us to get to where we are today.

Through the years, three people with interns in a cold basement turned into 30 people having pizza at the office most days, then into 150 people celebrating our 10th year anniversary. Fast forward to today, there are more than 300 Dashlaners working to deliver the credential security that every business and employee needs to thrive. 

Weâ€™ve now grown to secure the credentials - passwords, passkeys, and secrets - of more than 23,000 organizations and millions of consumers. Weâ€™ve taken the lessons learned from our consumer heritage to provide the workforce fast and secure access to applications, and to give IT admins tools for proactive breach protection. We're also leading the push towards confidential computing use in credential management, and are deeply involved in building a passwordless future.

Credential management has evolved into so much more than facilitating good password hygiene. Attacks targeting the user are growing in both frequency and sophistication, and so organizations today are recognizing that credential security is not a nice-to-have, but a foundational part of their tech stack.

We've only begun to explore what's possible in our space. There's more coming soon.

Happy birthday, Dashlane!",334,303,18,13,6d,Frederico Padilha celebrates this,,2024-07-18 14:20,Thursday,6:20 PM,7/18/2024,6-7pm,Thursday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Human-centered design, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development"

Others say it will become a stranded asset. 

The claims are dubious.

In fact, consumers and the broader market are disproving them on a daily basis.

Last year, Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) criticized federal approval of a natural gas pipeline because he said it ""locks in long-term capital investments"" in gas and will become a ""costly stranded asset."" In 2022, California announced a ""review"" of pipelines to ""avoid stranded assets"" and which ""advances our transition away from natural gas."" The Illinois Commerce Commission recently initiated its own ""Future of Gas"" proceedings with concerns about ""stranded assets"" and the need for so-called ""non-pipeline alternatives"" to new gas investments.

But households and other consumers are telling a completely different story: we want gas.

The U.S. natural gas system adds a new customer every minute. Polls also consistently show that Americans have no interest in banning #gasstoves or creating other restrictions on consumer choice. 

American families don't seem concerned about locking in delivery of the affordable fuel they want. 

Many have spent years just trying to get access. In Taos County, NM, residents waited decades to get connected to the natural gas system. This past spring, developers announced a pipeline project was finally moving forward. 

""We're excited for it,"" a local tribal leader said. ""We've been working on it since 2006-2007, trying to get natural gas up this way."" Estimates show switching to natural gas will save local customers $1,800 per year, a massive relief for a county where the median household income is 25% below the national average.

Last week, Reuters reported that U.S. power generators burned a record amount of natural gas as temperatures rose and air conditioning needs soared. And as Richard Meyer recently pointed out, based on data from the U.S. EIA, natural gas â€“ already the top fuel for power generation nationally â€“ is on the verge of becoming the top primary energy source in the United States.

The president of the New England Power Generators Association recently explained that when the region has closed coal- or oil-fired generation, it's not typically being replaced by wind or solar. It's being replaced by natural gas. 

Globally, the picture is similar. Worldwide #LNG trade hit an all-time high in 2023. In an analysis released this month, the International Energy Agency said global natural gas demand increased (again) in the first half of 2024.

Claims about ""stranded assets"" and avoiding fossil fuel ""lock in"" reflect a disregard for what consumers actually want. The only way these assets will become ""stranded"" is if the same advocates making those claims successfully lobby for policies to restrict gas. The market is moving toward more natural gas, not less.

Demand matters.

While Effie Worldwide highlights some strong achievements (link in first comment, congrats to all companies on the list!), itâ€™s crucial to remember that effectiveness is just one piece of the puzzle ðŸ§© 

To truly maximize the value of marketing investments, we must consider the holy trio of media:

ðŸŒ Reach. It determines the total number of people our message reaches within a specific brand target group
ðŸ’° Efficiency. It assesses the quality audiences reached per dollar spent, ensuring maximum reach within budget
ðŸ›’ Effectiveness. It measures the conversion rate in terms of sales driven for each of the people reached

Research by McKinsey & Company suggests that brands focusing on all three metrics together see an average of 1.5x higher revenue growth compared to those focusing on effectiveness alone ðŸ“Š

Their chart of the past, present, and future evolution of automation architectures â€” rules-based playbooks -> BPM -> Low-Code Task Automation -> RPA -> Co-Pilots -> Agentic Automation -> General Purpose AI â€” seems right on.

This 3rd edition was incredible with some of the smartest minds and most advanced companies on the topic of Retail Media and Data Collaboration coming from everywhere to speak and attend.

We explored crucial themes in data collaboration:
- Asmita Dubey, CDMO of L'OrÃ©al, shared how their data-driven strategy fuels their ""Beauty for each, powered by Beauty Tech"" approach, revolutionizing the beauty industry.
- We learned how data is central to the organization of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, optimizing everything from ticket bookings to athlete departures, public transportation, and luggage management.
- The latest best-in-class use cases in retail media were explored, highlighting synergies between TikTok, Connected TV, and advanced measurement methods.
- Practical steps to accelerate in data collaboration were discussed, emphasizing the importance of shared learning agendas, culture alignment, and measurement standardization.

I'm incredibly proud of our Numberly team for bringing together such thought-provoking leaders and fostering rich discussions that will undoubtedly shape the future of our industry.
Feel free to watch the replays of this great summit on our website: https://lnkd.in/eqY5aVtp

Medicine, by definition, requires constant evaluation. At both a macro and individual/micro level. We research to improve what we know, to understand what is happening to our patients and populations and what we can do about it. The goal is to figure out how to do better. Improve our health to its fullest for the time we have. 

Part of our oath is promising to respect the scientific gains of our peers. Because we don't know everything. New discoveries are made all the time. Whether in the lab or in processes. 

Questioning is part of the contract. This is why we don't practice the way we did even 5 years ago, much less 100 years ago. We learn and adapt. That is how science works. 

Like any area of medicine, #telemedicine is subject to the same requirements. Asking questions, researching the answers and disseminating that information is necessary to improve what we know. Pushback on change is not an outright denunciation of it. It is a call and request to do it better so we can utilize it effectively. 

That is what Ateev Mehrotra was and has been doing. I'll give you an example. An oft cited article from 2017 in Health Affairs demonstrated that #telehealth increased healthcare #utilization and, in turn, increased #costs. 

What do telehealth advocates do with that information? We had two options: 
1) Throw in the towel 
Or
2) Do what we did and ask the requisite follow-up. How do we bring down those costs? Can we show a different ROI? Do patients getting seen earlier improve downstream costs? Are there other benefits to telehealth that balance this out? 

Also, there is only cooperation. Lori Uscher-Pines was a co-author on that paper and worked with us at Jefferson for awhile. Because everyone had the same goal of improving care. 

In a more recent paper, looking at #antibiotic prescriptions for #pediatrics demonstrated less prescriptions in a #hybrid telemedicine and #primarycare model. Knowing this can lead to better care models, #QA and antibiotic stewardship. 

Medicine and healthcare benefits when we have the discourse. When we pushback and figure out what is right and works. 

The research has also started to show improvements in care and costs when it previously had only shown equivocal care or worsening. Probably because we learnt. 

I cannot stress enough what a small world telehealth was in the beginning. We all generally worked toward the same goals. Naysayers were not unusual, it was the norm. The pandemic changed some but not all of that. Instead there is another focus and potential villain for the #healthtech changes we are implementing. 

No matter. Those digital health solutions will be evaluated in the same manner. 

And if we have to re-evaluate as this goes to #CMS? Great. It is part of the process. Let's make it better.

Twenty million people are expected to retire over the next 10 years. That means we are already in the throes of a tectonic workforce change that will affect every sectorâ€”public, private, and nonâ€”profitâ€”and will create an enormous talent gap. 

The Latino Leadership Academy consists of 6 high-quality online courses for individuals and corporations.Â The programming covers personal, professional, and leadership development for Latinos and Allies. It is primarily designed for professionals aspiring to access senior-level positions. 

Thank you to my partners Perla Tamez Casasnovas and Robert Rodriguez, PhD for joining me in this project and sharing your singular expertise in talent development.

The public will also have access to the live feeds from any of the cameras.

Our crews recently installed the first camera station in Lahaina and has plans to deploy a total of 78 stations in elevated fire risk areas on the five islands served by the company, with each location having two cameras to provide a full 360-degree view. The camera feeds will be monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The $14 million project is the latest step in our ongoing effort to reduce the risk of wildfires associated with company equipment. 

â€œWe are continuing to take action to address the growing risks from wildfires across our service territory using a variety of technologies and methods,â€ said Jim Alberts, Hawaiian Electric senior vice president and chief operations officer. â€œInstalling publicly viewable AI-assisted video cameras in elevated fire risk areas will enable the company, fire agencies, and emergency operations centers the ability to identify potential wildfires early and respond quickly.â€

We have signed a five-year contract with California-based ALERTWest. ALERTWestâ€™s software platform, which is widely used in fire-prone areas through the Western U.S., is assisted by AI to detect smoke and other early indications of fire in real-time. It was developed by ALERTWest in collaboration with UC San Diegoâ€™s ALERTCalifornia team, California utilities, and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). ALERTWest also recently partnered with the University of Oregon and the University of Nevada, Reno, creating the largest publicly available, interoperable, AI wildfire detection system in the United States. The system is assisted by AI to detect smoke and other early indications of fire in real time, day and night. This allows first responders and emergency personnel to cross state boundaries in mutual aid situations and have access to the tool when needed.The AI Solution was recognized as one of TIMEâ€™s best inventions of 2023.

The public will be able to access the live feeds from any of the cameras on the ALERTWest website at https://alertwest.live/. Half of the video camera stations are expected to be operational by September 2024, with the remainder to be installed in the first half of 2025.

Today, I had the opportunity to participate in my second build for #TheWashingMachineProject with the #WhirlpoolFoundation. More than half of the world's population is still doing their laundry by hand - in places where water and electricity are scarce. The manual machines we made today will be off to places like those around the globe soon, helping to reclaim time and improve lives. My experience was quite literally RIVETING, as that's the role I got to play! Tremendous thanks to all who make this possible, including Navjot Sawhney, Pamela Rogers Klyn, Deb OConnor, Rosa Skinner, and so many more. â¤ï¸ #WhirlpoolEmployee",129,124,5,0,5d,Murat Genc likes this,,2024-07-18 23:46,Friday,3:46 AM,7/19/2024,3-4am,Friday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"Organizational Change Management, Product Development"

We believe going #passwordless in seamless and simple way is the way to turn that into reality. And yes, there have been many companies and standards  (#CISA #MFA #FIDO #passkeys #OpenID and more) over years that have tried to grow that adoption and have not reached that point where we stop seeing passwords based thefts and breaches. 

The podcast below explains:
(1) what is #passwordless , 
(2) how to make it easy to adopt (step by step implementation) #passwordless in a language that any non-cyber expert can also understand and implement, and
(3) how Hawcx is helping in that journey

As we celebrated Independence Day, Zonzon Inc. was able to organize and host a fun-filled hot dogs, burgers, and drinks event that brought residents at Volta at Voyager Apartments together.  The beautiful community is managed by Kawann Smith of Asset Living and Kara Gonzalez their leasing agent. 

We had a group of wonderful sponsors from Isaac Konegni of SERVPRO of Northern Colorado Springs / Tri-Lakes; Timothy Phares of Family Care Center and Brian Berg from Thrivent supporting and sponsoring bringing people together.

Events like these are more than just celebrationsâ€”they strengthen the bonds that make apartments special. When we come together, we create a support network, foster friendships, and build a sense of belonging.

Thank you to everyone who joined us for a day of laughter, delicious food, and unforgettable memories. Let's continue to celebrate our incredible community.

ðŸŒŸ Thrilled to Share a Milestone! ðŸŒŸ

I am beyond excited and honored to announce that I have been awarded the Microsoft Pinnacle Award! This recognition is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and passion that I bring to my role every day.

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my amazing team, mentors, and colleagues who have supported and inspired me throughout this journey. Your encouragement and collaboration have been invaluable.

A special thank you to Melanie Davis, Andrea Russell, Tracy Galloway, and Deb Cupp. Your leadership and support have provided the infrastructure (runway) that allows me to lead and excel. I am truly grateful for your guidance and trust.

Being at the forefront of Microsoftâ€™s AI Transformation, especially with Copilot, has been an incredible experience. Itâ€™s been truly rewarding to contribute to such groundbreaking advancements and to be recognized for it.

This award is not just a personal achievement but a reflection of the incredible work we do together at Microsoft. It motivates me to continue striving for excellence and to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

 â€œFrom great power comes great responsibility.â€
 
 As undisputed leader in Electrical Distribution, customers and partners expressed great expectations to Schneider Electric to lead the #energytransition and support them along the net-zero journey.

Leadership means capacity to embrace the change and more, drive it toward the highest goals!
It means also walk the talk (or #runthetalk in our case ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ Â ).

The post below is an example of this: the first â€œFull DC Microgrid for Parking Lotâ€ 
https://lnkd.in/e3JBB6AS
 
This post instead is meant to be a heartful thank you to the fantastic team who has spent weeks working hard on this project. 

A team with transversal and complementary competencies: #distribution, #conversion, #protection, #installationâ€¦.everything boosted by common passion, humility and desire to learn and improve day by day!
 Special thanks for the people who literally moved their working positions from the office to the parking lot in the last weeks ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Nicola PastÃ², Julien Renoux, Jad Azzam, Jonathan van der Heiden, Yann FRAILE, Sumit Jena ( check the pictures to see pure passion!!)
 
 ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
 
 And leadership means also acumen to surround yourself by the best partners:

Without their buy-in, youâ€™ll struggle to execute the strategy and find it hard to deliver the roadmap.

But how can you secure stakeholder agreement without making weak compromises and resorting to design by committee? In my latest article, I share four tips to help you address this challenge:

1ï¸âƒ£ Involve the Right Stakeholders
Engage the individuals whose expertise and support you need to make the right decisions and successfully implement them.

2ï¸âƒ£ Secure the Right Level of Buy-in
Unanimity for a new or significantly changed product strategy and consent for smaller strategy changes and roadmap decisions.

3ï¸âƒ£ Co-create the Product Strategy and Roadmap 
Jointly create and evolve the product strategy and roadmap instead of presenting the plans to the stakeholders and convincing them to agree with the plans.

4ï¸âƒ£ Help Stakeholders Meet their Commitments
Donâ€™t ignore the issue if a stakeholder does not follow the product strategy or roadmap they have agreed to. Offer constructive feedback instead by using my feedback framework.

I hope you'll find my advice helpful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments!

Taiwan did not ""stealâ€ the #semiconductors industry from the US. It is the American companies that decided to outsource the fabs of the most advanced semis to TSMC.
Taiwan also spends a significant part of its GDP on defense. 
As I said several times, 95% of advanced semis are manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, underscoring the technological talent of Taiwanese and South Korean people. Intel Corporation is trying to bring back semi-fabs in the US but is punished savagely by a myopic Wall Street that cares only about an easy buck and not about our country's national #security. In the last few days, Wall Street sold semiconductor companies, causing huge losses to companies and retail investors just because it heard some words. 
The free world and the US need Taiwan to prosper economically and be independent.

Completing my first half marathon felt impossible, yet there I was, pushing through mile 10 in the Napa to Sonoma race, with my wife Ann's unwavering support.

Eight half marathons later with the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation Team Challenge program, we'd raised over $100k for a cause close to my heart. The Team Challenge Family, along with Ann, became an incredible support system, even leading to an unforgettable meeting with Rolf Benirschke, former NFL kicker, IBD warrior and my hero.

The struggle to complete these races mirrors leading a startup. Nike's ""Just Do It"" sparks initial efforts, but it's the character built over years that sustains you. The resilience I developed through thousands of training miles, and Ann's constant encouragement, now fuel my entrepreneurial journey.

As I navigate the ups and downs of startup life, I'm reminded of those final miles. The finish line may seem distant, but each step builds something meaningful.

What challenges have prepared you for your current role? How do you apply those lessons?

In summer of 2004, I walked into 850 3rd Avenue in New York in a baggy suit and with hair to start work at Gerson Lehrman Group. The place was electric.

Little did I know then that Iâ€™d find a place to grow for two decades. 

GLG was a novel idea. 1:1 learning with experts clearly resonated with investors. By the time I joined, the company had broken through the startup phase, yet we knew the opportunity was much bigger.Â There were thousands more professionals, scientists, and former public officials with expertise to share.Â And we could improve decision-making at all sorts of organizations.

Over the years, we pioneered the expert economy. Our leaders built a culture of doing things the right way, not taking shortcuts. And we made magic through millions of matches. GLG is 10x bigger than when I started, and I had the opportunity to go from a young contributor and team leader to the executive team. The company continues to innovate, and AI is a tailwind.

LinkedIn can show you the connections Iâ€™ve made, the roles I had, and where I lived.

What LinkedIn canâ€™t tell you is how much I learned.

It canâ€™t tell you the extraordinary impact so many of you had on me. I always loved how we were competitive externally but collaborative internally. I had the privilege to help serve some of the best investors in the world and savvy strategy consultants. And I benefitted from amazing managers, peers willing to share, and ambitious teams around me. Iâ€™ve particularly enjoyed seeing so many teammates grow and take on exciting roles at GLG and beyond. 

LinkedIn also cannot tell you how much fun I had. 

Heck, I even met my wife through the GLG network, thanks to a colleagueâ€™s introduction.

Whatâ€™s next?

Iâ€™ve decided to become a GLG client! 

Together with two Partners and support from early GLGers and others, weâ€™ve launched an investment firm, Switchback Capital LLC. 

I will introduce Switchback and more detail on our first two portfolio companies, Smokey Mo's BBQ and Carlisle Wide Plank Floors, in the weeks to come.

Iâ€™ve been inspired meeting and learning from so many incredible GLG experts. And like our smartest clients, we will leverage GLG even more systematically at Switchback to grow our business and our portfolio companies.

It takes more characters than LinkedIn allows to thank everyone who gave me chances and mentored me, and made my time at GLG such a joy.

Thank you all!",1455,1221,228,6,2w,Teresa Anne Sweeney loves this,,2024-07-19 15:19,Friday,7:19 PM,7/19/2024,7-8pm,Friday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Organizational Change Management

My oldest and I have been at the Turner Syndrome Society of the United States annual conference this weekend. It is a beautiful community that rallies around this rare disease.

If you are not familiar with TS, it is a complex genetic disorder that occurs in 1-2% of conceptions, and only 1% of those survive through pregnancy. My daughter is extraordinary, as are all the other girls and women who are living with Turner Syndrome.

Like most rare diseases, research for Turner Syndrome is severely underfunded. We must continue to push groups like The National Institutes of Health to ensure Turner Syndrome and other diseases that disproportionately affect women receive more funding. There is still so much to learn.

Unfortunately, many people in leadership positions throw their team under the bus when errors are made and fail to accept any reasonability for anything in their department and, by extension, their organization.

Insecure and weak leaders hate admitting that anything has gone wrong and will try to spin the situation to their advantage, but true leaders are humble enough to admit their mistakes, stand up for their team and create an environment that allows people to learn from their mistakes as opposed to hiding them.

This classification system aims to clarify our journey towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Current Level: 
ðŸ”¹ Level 1 - Conversational AI: This is the AI we interact with today, such as ChatGPT, which excels at human-like conversations. These systems can engage in natural dialogue, demonstrating a foundational understanding and the ability to respond to a wide range of prompts and questions.

Next Level: 
ðŸ”¹ Level 2 - Reasoners: These AI systems will be capable of solving complex problems with the proficiency of human experts. These systems perform problem-solving tasks at the level of a PhD-educated individual, without access to external resources. This represents a significant leap from mimicking human behavior to demonstrating genuine intellectual prowess. We are currently on the cusp of achieving this level.

Future Levels: 
ðŸ”¹ Level 3 - Agents: At this stage, AI systems will operate autonomously for extended periods, taking actions on a userâ€™s behalf. These agents will handle complex tasks, make decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances without constant human oversight, representing a major advancement in AI autonomy and practical utility.

ðŸ”¹ Level 4 - Innovators: AI systems at this level will be capable of developing groundbreaking ideas and solutions across various fields. This stage signifies AIâ€™s ability to drive innovation and progress independently, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

ðŸ”¹ Level 5 - Organizations: AI systems functions as entire entities, managing complex operations, strategic thinking, and adaptability. These AI organizations will have the capability to oversee and execute tasks that currently require human management and coordination.

This structured framework provides a clear pathway toward AGI, setting measurable milestones to track progress. AI researchers have debated the criteria for achieving AGI for years. These frameworks are akin to the automotive industryâ€™s system for assessing self-driving cars' automation levels.

We can expect AI advancements that bring us closer to a future where AI systems can perform and innovate at levels beyond human potential within this decade.",31,29,2,0,4d,Punit Mahajan likes this,,2024-07-21 02:07,Sunday,6:07 AM,7/21/2024,6-7am,Sunday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"AI/ Machine Learning, Customer Centricity, Data & Analytics, Digital Transformation, Human-centered design, Innovation, Organizational Change Management, Product Development, Research & Development, Transactions"

My first foray into business nearly led me to bankruptcy, but I didn't give up. Instead, I chose to invest in myself and my future by using the GI Bill to pursue education in my 30s.

Despite the prevailing sentiment these days that education is a waste of time, my experience was quite the opposite. Going back to school was a challenging journey, but it proved to be the best decision I ever made. It provided me with the knowledge, skills, and resilience needed to rebuild my career and succeed in the tech and defense industries. I used to carry a machine gun, and now I sit at a keyboard, demonstrating that the skills and discipline from the battlefield translate well into the classroom and beyond.

Education has made all the difference for me. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for personal and professional growth, and I firmly believe itâ€™s always a good choice. As long as opportunities for learning are available, I will relentlessly pursue them. To anyone doubting the value of education, I encourage you to take that step. The investment in yourself is always worth it.

Couple of interesting facts: 
- 1st time 4 people from the same batch got BITS Distinguished Award in the same year.
- Shishir Joshipura and I have been studying together since 6th grade. 
Same school (Mahavir School), Same City (Jaipur) and the same hostel (Shankar Bhavan). 11 of us from the same class at Mahavir School went to BITS Pilani in 1978. 
- Many people may not know but my first startup was with the other two gentlemen Anil Gupta and Sanjeev Tirath. We all started a company named ""STACS"" in 1984 (System Technology and Consulting Services). Many other people Sanjeev Gupta, Ashok Kumar, Divyavir Rastogi, Ramesh Pandey, Namita Gupta, Sanjeev Sood helped in this endeavor. We did probably one of the early digitization projects for ""Gendamal Hemraj"" the famous shop on Mall Road Shimla and also developed first flight display system for the Delhi airport among others. While all of us went out different ways, Anil Gupta (Jaat) kept STACS going and later started Microtek and Okaya. Tirath went to US and started Pyramid Consulting. Shishir led important companies like Thermax, SKF and now Praj.
- Rajasthan got severe floods (Can you believe it) in 1978 and we had a very exciting time in reaching from Jaipur to Pilani (That story for some other time ðŸ˜Š

It was an invaluable experience, filled with networking, insightful conversations with executives, and significant personal and professional growth. Iâ€™m extremely grateful for the opportunity to learn from and connect with such inspiring individuals!

We had the privilege of hearing from an exceptional panel of executives, including our remarkable CEO, Sarah M. London. Her insights and leadership are truly inspiring, especially as she is recognized as the youngest female CEO of a Fortune 25 company. It was also an honor to hear from Tanya McNally , Brian LeClaire , Shannon Thornton Susko , Susan Smith and Alice Hm Chen.  Having leaders of such importance and power take the time to speak with us was truly motivating and showed their commitment to our growth and development.

Also at the summit, we had the opportunity to build skateboards for Foster Love, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of children in foster care. 

Kelley Peters, VP of Public Health & Foster Care Operations, delivered a speech that truly resonated with me. Two things she said stood out: â€œYour voice is valuable, use it.â€ As someone who sometimes hesitates to speak up, it was empowering to hear this from someone in her position. She also emphasized the â€œPower of the Pause,â€ reminding us to pause and remember our mission and purpose. In our fast-paced company and world, it's crucial to take a moment to reflect on why we do what we do.

And a big thank you to Centene's University Relations team for planning such an amazing summit!

I am extremely proud to work for a company that prioritizes the well-being of individuals, one person at a time. #OneCenteam #Centene",118,104,14,0,5d,Brian LeClaire likes this,,2024-07-22 11:12,Monday,3:12 PM,7/22/2024,3-4pm,Monday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

I had the chance to meet so many amazing people and I have grown so much from this experience. Connecting with fellow interns was a highlight, and it was inspiring to see the passion and dedication of everyone involved.

I had the privilege of meeting and engaging with some of the amazing leaders of Centene including Wade Rakes , Drew Asher, Tanya McNally, Brian LeClaire, Shannon Thornton Susko , Susan Smith and Alice Hm Chen. The fact that these leaders took the time to speak with us was not only motivating but it showed Centeneâ€™s commitment to growth and development. Their advice on making the most of our intern experience and careers was truly invaluable. They encouraged us to always be curious, go for what we want, and never back down.

One of the most meaningful parts of the summit was the community service project. We built skateboards for Foster Love an initiative that not only allowed us to give back to the community but also helped us further connect with our cohort for a good cause. This experience was deeply impactful, highlighting the importance of service, a core value at Centene.

The summit featured not only professional development workshops on networking, but also personal development sessions. I particularly enjoyed sessions on the value of knowing ourselves and understanding our unique personalities. These insights into self-awareness and improving interactions were incredibly enlightening.

Hearing from Sarah M. London , our incredible CEO and the youngest female CEO of the Fortune 500, was particularly inspiring to me as a young woman just starting my professional career. Her journey and passion for Centene and its mission were so motivating, leaving a lasting impression on me and encouraging me to push beyond my comfort zone and strive for nothing less than excellence.

I want to extend a huge thank you to the University Relations team and everyone involved for organizing such an amazing event. Their dedication and effort made this experience truly special. I am walking away with a wealth of knowledge, inspiration, and a renewed sense of purpose.

Her unwavering commitment and hands-on approach to ward issues are unparalleled. With over 25 years in City Government, predominantly in leadership roles, Marlene's impact is undeniable. 

Noteworthy is her academic achievements, earning two degrees while reshaping the City's building codes. Marlene's talent and accomplishments are truly awe-inspiring. Chicago is fortunate to have Commissioner Hopkins at the helm, ensuring a brighter future for our city.

It was an immense honor to introduce President Joe Biden in the Rose Garden for the historic Chips Act two years ago. The White House Today, as he steps out of the race for President, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for his unwavering dedication to our nation.

President Biden will be remembered as a great leader and a true champion of electric vehicles (EVs) and cleantech innovation. His administrationâ€™s steadfast commitment to sustainability has accelerated the transition to a cleaner, greener future, and has set a strong foundation for continued progress in the fight against climate change.

Under his leadership, weâ€™ve witnessed monumental advancements in the EV sector, from increased support for infrastructure to substantial investments in cleantech. These efforts have not only spurred economic growth but have also paved the way for a more sustainable and resilient America.

At SparkCharge, we are inspired by President Bidenâ€™s vision and leadership. We remain dedicated to driving innovation in EV charging solutions, knowing that our work aligns with the larger mission he championed.

Thank you, President Biden, for your tireless service and for leaving a lasting legacy that will benefit generations to come. Your impact on the cleantech industry and our environment is immeasurable.

Hereâ€™s to a brighter, cleaner future! ðŸŒâš¡ï¸

Those who know me know one of my hobbies is pinball. I love the combination of mechanical and electrical, physical and digital, artistry and engineering, strategy and chaos. As an arcade junkie growing up in the 80â€™s, pinball had two advantages to my second love of video games.

1) No matter how good you were, luck and physics made every game unique.Â You could master the patterns of Donkey Kong or Ms. Pac Man (or: later, Street Fighter IIâ€¦which spurred my short lived career hustling quarters across the greater Cincinnati area in high school).Â But a game with a steel ball moving 90 mph smashing into physical targets presented a MUCH higher bar for greatness.

2) If you played well enough, youâ€™d get rewarded with free games. It was easy calculus: a little bit of skill would let my one dollar allowance stretch a ton further.

I bought my first machine in 2000 (The Whoâ€™s Tommy!), but actively tried to keep anyone at work from finding out.Â At the time, being a deep technologist (OK, geek) wasnâ€™t exactly endearing to corporate America. I was busy buying cuff links and Franklin Planners trying to show that I had â€œbusiness chopsâ€.Â But it didnâ€™t take long to realize that my authentic self was not just tolerated, but celebrated.Â And making time to nurture and tinker with your hobbies outside of work is essential to cultivating your own well-being.
 
That same original pinball machine is in my home office (along with some friends); depending on how I position my camera, itâ€™s visible during video conferences with clients, teammates, and the media.Â Proudly on display and something I love showing off.Â During an interview last month, it caught Billy Hurleyâ€™s eye while we were talking about Technical Debt. 
 
Which launched a follow-up piece with IT Brew focused on multimeters, solenoids, and how years of fixing up and troubleshooting my collection of pinball machines relates to my day job.Â Call it â€˜Zen and the art of pinball maintenanceâ€™ - with some corollaries to rolling up sleeves to harness emerging tech. 
 
â€œBriggs provides the realistic vision for companies considering quantum computing, industrial metaverse, and advanced physical roboticsâ€”technologies that have barely arrived long enough to be broken and troubleshooted. But he doesnâ€™t really have to take apart machinery these daysâ€”professionally, at least.â€ 
 
Grateful to Billy and the team at Morning Brew for so accurately capturing my love for pinball machines, extensive metaphors, and spot-on pop culture references. ðŸ˜‰

Many of my clients and colleagues whoâ€™ve known me for years know that the Insurance Practice has been a home for me since the very early days of my career at McKinsey.Â Iâ€™ve had the privilege to serve carriers in every major region, across the Life, P&C, Brokerage, Reinsurance, Private Equity/Private Capital industries.Â And Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of serving established corporates as well as insurtech disruptors.
 
The industry is going through an unprecedented period of change and is at a true inflection point, spurred by shifting customer expectations, a changing risk landscape (including the effects of climate change), the arrival of GenAI, a shifting macroeconomic (and interest rate) environment, and geopolitical factors affecting multinational players and their clients. 

All of this creates significant risk and opportunity for players in every part of the industry, and I am excited to partner with the entire Insurance practice, full of amazing leaders, to help our clients and the industry meet the moment.
 
I also have so much gratitude for the full #LeapbyMcKinsey team for an amazing ride over the past 5 years.Â Together, we helpedÂ build over 600 new businesses with our clients across industries, including 20 â€œunicornsâ€ and two â€œdecacornsâ€ â€“ and last year alone, we helped generate over $140 billion in value and more than 20,000 jobs.Â I have no doubt the Leap team will scale to new heights in the coming years.Â Special thanks to my co-leaders in Paul Jenkins and before that Ralf Dreischmeier.",931,776,154,1,2w,Teresa Anne Sweeney likes this,,2024-07-23 00:22,Tuesday,4:22 AM,7/23/2024,4-5am,Tuesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,"Organizational Change Management, Transactions"

As AI continues to advance, so does energy demand, increasing by a notable 15% annually for data centers, outpacing the overall growth of 4%. AndrÃ©s emphasized, ""The only way the United States (energy) demand does not grow, quite frankly, is if suddenly the AI revolution stops."" 

In 2023, we generated enough energy to serve the annual consumption of approximately 22 million people in the places we operate. And that is continuing to grow. With a more than 12 GW backlog, AES is one of the largest renewable energy providers to corporations and specifically to technology companies.

Somebody has lit the fire under democrats. Kamala Harris has become shoo-in candidate; public having spoken with $81 millions contribution in 24 hours!

Kamala's first speech in Delaware where she went to take charge of the campaign machinery was articulate and forceful. She went for DJT's jugular, calling him a convicted rapist.

Republicans have been caught flat-footed. Republican conference in Milwaukee seems like it was eons ago. JD Vance speech in his hometown rally was silly, calling Kamala an enabler of Biden's wasted three years. 

It seems that Democrats are going to fight this election on two fronts, touting their achievements (Obama care, Chips Act,  Infra-structure  Bill and Inflation Reduction act, 15 million jobs, Re-energized NATO)and calling out DJT's shenanigans. Age shoe is on the other foot now. DJT is the oldest candidate ever to run. He will be compared against a vibrant Kamala rather than senile Joe.

I often preach about how important it is to narrow to the segment level. Often we see marketers and sales people create overly broad statements because they are trying to appeal to too many buyers/personas at once.

I spent 3 days immersed in the multifaceted world of Prosci Change Management with our fantastic instructors Emma Oberdieck and Tracy Richardson, Ph.D., and a powerhouse class of fellow practitioners. 

I learned a lot of cool things straight from Prosciâ€™s research, and discovered that Iâ€™m already taking a similar approach to change for my teams today. Throughout my journey as a project manager and release train engineer, change has always been there for me. And regardless of what framework or methodology is in play, taking a people centered approach to navigating change is my M.O.

- Google has said they are now putting the choice to opt-out in the hands of consumers, potentially something similar to Apple's ATT framework. If thatâ€™s the case, weâ€™ll see 70-80% of consumers opt out of cross-site tracking.

- This will mean cookies can no longer be the primary mode of tracking, and user identification will continue to shift in favor of first-party identifiers like HEMs.

- The pressing need for permissioned, first-party purchase data does not change, and still crucial for optimizing and measuring real business outcomes.

I'm enormously proud of and grateful to the technology team at Intermountain Health for all their accomplishments in the last few years to improve care for patients and enhance the efficiency and experience for our caregivers. It's not easy work, but it's been vital work.

Being the Chief Digital & Information Officer at both SCL Health and then Intermountain Health has been a great privilege and honor. I want to reflect on some of what the team has accomplished over the last few years:

- Consolidating 9 EMRs to one with Epic

- Achieved a 10 Gold Star Rating on ourÂ current Epic platform ranking in the top 3% in the nation

- Moving from multiple ERP systems to one with Workday

-Â Standardizing to a single contact center tech stack with Salesforce, Genesys, and Hyro

- Combined multiple ServiceNow environments to a single instance

- Deployed digital assets to improve patient access and experience with Kyruus Health and Zocdoc

- Transitioned multiple Microsoft and Google cloud environments to one with Microsoft Azure 

- Deployed Qualtrics to the enterprise for patient, caregiver and provider engagement

- Initiated dozens of AI initiatives including ambient listening, virtual nursing and other digital assistants

- And more...

When I consider all that hasÂ been accomplished, it is the right time to find the next challenge,Â a new starting line. It's always sad to leave one place, but the team at Intermountain Health is top notch and I'm so grateful to have served.

TheseÂ are exciting times for all of us in healthcare IT.

It wasn't an easy decision - at Relativity Space I was helping architect one of the largest privately-developed rocket engines ever to challenge SpaceX's dominance of the industry. But I've always had an even bigger ambition of helping build a city on Mars, and had been realizing for several years that transportation was just one small piece of the puzzle.

It's now been one year since I co-founded Cosmic Robotics. We build autonomous solar farm construction robots that radically accelerate the installation of renewable energy to the grid. With current labor shortages in construction, this is a critical technology necessary for meeting the US target of installing 600 million more solar panels by 2030. 

But we won't stop at just accelerating Earth's transition to renewable energy - our long-term vision is to make sustainable life multiplanetary and to autonomously build cities on both Earth and Mars.

Diving into entrepreneurship, not to also mention an entirely new industry, several new fields of engineering, and moving to a new city has made the last year incredibly challenging. But these audacious missions keep me excited for every day and keep me pushing the boundaries of what I thought I could do - here's to many more years of building the future!",3266,3152,85,29,2w,Nick Possley likes this,,2024-07-23 20:12,Wednesday,12:12 AM,7/24/2024,12-1am,Wednesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Innovation

To maximize performance, safety, customizability, and efficiency, AI platforms must be open, just like the software infrastructure of the Internet became open.
- Open Source AI is good for developers: fine-tuning, distillation, safety, efficiency, privacy, flexibility, portability, affordability, and a large ecosystem of contributors.
- Open source AI is good for Meta: the larger the community, the faster the progress.
- Open source AI is good for the world: enables more diversity in languages, cultures, value systems, and centers of interest in AI assistants.

To gain context and provide some practical tips on how to advance the AI transformation, ServiceNow teamed up with Oxford Economics to develop our first annual Enterprise AI Maturity Index study: https://lnkd.in/dS4NjHhe

We surveyed ~4,500 executives along five dimensions: AI Maturity, Strategy, Talent, Governance, and Investments. My biggest takeaway, the pacesetters are doing things a bit differently:
â—¾ 62% of pacesetters have robust ROI measures in place vs. 28% of others
â—¾ 64% of pacesetters have top-down C-suite involvement vs. 34% of others
â—¾ 61% of pacesetters have the right AI skills in place vs. 30% of others

We all know that getting AI right and transforming at pace are critical to our organizations.

Thanks to the #USSpeakerProgram, this past month I had the opportunity to travel to Chennai, Kolkata, and New Delhi with the guidance and support of team members across these cities' US Consulates or US Embassy offices, including their respective American Center hubs. The US Speaker Program graciously invited me to share my experiences working on topics ranging from #TransportationElectrification, #CleanEnergyTransition, #BatteryCircularity, #SupplyChainSustainability, #Equity, and #WomenInSTEAM.

Read more in the article to see where I went, ask me any questions about my reflections, reach out for any requests to connect with the incredible contacts and friends I've made, refer someone you know my way if I can help them explore a career in STEAM, and, finally, consider your role in this time of transition. What is one thing you commit to do to convert your concern, motivation, or restlessness into a positive impact?

The list of names of every individual or organization across multiple continents who supported me on this trip is inordinately long, so I'll make sure to start by acknowledging and thanking Peggy Pope and the entire US Speaker Program team, including Madhuri S., Brindha Jayakanth, ANUTOSH BISWAS, Sucharita Bhattacharjee, Juan Clar, Neetu, and Kashish Sethi from the U.S. Department of State, the host institutions and organizations I note in my article, and Kayla Gibbs and other team members from the Michigan Public Service Commission who did an excellent job researching, deriving insights, and designing materials to communicate core messaging for ten days' worth of dialogs, presentations, and relationship building.",76,66,10,0,1w,Tilak Subrahmanian commented on this,,2024-07-24 01:58,Wednesday,5:58 AM,7/24/2024,5-6am,Wednesday,Alessandra - sounds like you had a very informative and engaging trip.

We understand that the challenges we are facing as well as the opportunities and solutions we are developing are not specifically unique to each individual company and that we are stronger together. By coming together, we can better support our common mission of providing safe and reliable electricity to our customers and the State of California. Our group focus areas include: (1) Â Accelerate speed to value â€“ share best practices and avoid hurdles others have already crossed to create tangible results on shorter timelines that are more cost effective and drive higher quality; and (2) Present a unified front to support our regulators â€“ by coordinating our efforts and making holistic data-driven recommendations to the CPUC we enable the best opportunities to improve our operating environments for our customers.

On July 8th and 9th, we had the pleasure of hosting our IOU partners for workshops. We used to the workshops to: (1) understand the status at each IOU relating to inspections (2) focus on priority shared initiatives; and (3) solidified and enhanced working relationships to enable us to move faster and smarter. Albert Ma Kristi Gardner Matt Peacore Zining Yang, PhD Ephraim Maniago Raymond Fugere Andrew Abranches Klavdianos John Rusty Vance.

On July 19th, myself and Russell Ragsdale, made a focused trip up to PG&Eâ€™s innovative Dublin office space to learn more about PG&Eâ€™s successful initiatives around: (1) Reinventing inspections, (2) comprehensive pole inspection program, and (3) mega bundling of M&C work to enable us to understand how to incorporate best practices at SCE that can enable safety, quality, and affordability breakthroughs. 

The inspections teams across the IOUs are committed to continue investing in this collaboration and harnessing the resulting value. Thank you to my partners Jason Regan at PG&E, Joshua Fredriksson at PG&E and Jennifer Kaminsky at SDG&E for partnering with us and co-investing with us. Also, thank you to Mathew Rommel and the R&A Consulting LLC team for recommending, shaping, and facilitating these interactions.

Our European Supply Chain serves as a critical backbone for the region, consistently producing healthy, nutritious food and treats for pets while constantly striving to be more sustainable, efficient, and agile.
 
Over the past few weeks, I had the privilege of visiting our factories in both Birstall, UK as well as Bokros, Hungary. And while they may be hundreds of miles apart, their shared commitment to taking care of our Associates, pets, pet parents and the planet was unmistakable.
 
During all my factory visits we spend time reviewing our progress on building Smart Factories of the future across our network as part of our focus on becoming a digital first organization. I particularly enjoyed meeting SPOT, a clever autonomous robot, during my recent visit to Birstall. SPOT showed off some of its skills and is working closely with our Associates to spot potential issues and improvements earlier than previously possible, significantly improving efficiency in our factory.
 
Thank you to our Supply Chain Associates across the world for all you do to bring quality and innovation to life each day!

Weâ€™re also thrilled to welcome new investors Goldman Sachs & J.P. Morgan to Vanta. Having their support speaks to the strength of our enterprise penetration and the incredible opportunity we have ahead of us.

2024 has been a big year for Vanta:
-Surpassed $100M in ARR just five years after entering the market 
-Nearly doubled global customer base to over 8,000 companies 
-Achieved 90% YoY growth in international customers
-Expanded to over 500 employees globally
-Launched hundreds of new product features to help teams build, maintain, and demonstrate trust 

If 2024 is any indication, the future looks bright for Vanta. Weâ€™ll be leveraging this latest round to continue accelerating our upmarket momentum by displacing manual, cumbersome GRC tools; solidifying Vanta as the peerless choice for ambitious startups; and deepening our global presence.

What has happened is that across the 1990s and 2000s, all the businesses that had no particular interest in computers were forced to computerize anyway.  Most of the time, CEOs were uncomfortable with computers and got no value out of the transition, just another cost center to pay.  They took someone that was hanging around the C suite and gave him the title of CIO.

Now you have somebody that is uncomfortable around computers, running a cost center.  The only measure of his importance is the size of the budget, and the only way to get any positive attention is to cut the budget.  (If you don't know how to make the spreadsheet bigger every year while ""cutting costs"" all along, you are not executive material, sorry.)  These CIOs are never going to build anything that matters to the business, because they have none of that talent working for them, and can't hire any.

What they do is write giant checks to a handful of vendors that the entire CIO herd uses.  The vendors have massive sales teams that are dedicated to pandering to the CIOs, so the CIO will spend most of the year golfing and watching NFL games from Cisco or Microsoft skyboxes.  This works great and everyone is happy and content.  There are CIO conferences, CIO magazines, CIO podcasts, and CIO awards ceremonies that all sustain and perpetuate this culture.

Unfortunately now it's 2024 and these CIOs run hollow ""IT"" organizations that are completely dependent on vendor support contracts.  There is no adaptability or resilience because there is no skill or capacity in-house.  Also, those clunky, overpriced vendor products that were nice-to-have in 1999 are now business-critical.  Now, a vendor screwup will bring your whole house down.

Tens of thousands of businesses have all done the same thing, so we have a monoculture where one screwup at one vendor can cripple a meaningful fraction of the economy.

That's why after 4 days, Delta still can't reboot its Windows computers and can't fly planes.",1944,1722,110,112,2w,Brett Brunick loves this,,2024-07-24 18:30,Wednesday,10:30 PM,7/24/2024,10-11pm,Wednesday,,,,,,,,,,,checked,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,MISC

Running a successful business topping the $50+ billion mark for the first time in 2023, means we have the capacity to invest in impactful initiatives making our business more sustainable. Over the past eight years, we have grown our business 60% and reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 16%. 

I am proud to say that we have committed $2.7 billion over three years to accelerate our journey to Net Zero. Â A good example of how we are doing this, is our investment in logistics efficiency by reducing travel distances while maximizing vehicle utilization. Our state-of-the-art London Thames Gateway facility is a result of a $400 million investment from MARS UK and DHL. Equipped with 3,700 solar panels, it generates 27% of its power needs and is among the top 1% of environmentally friendly non-domestic buildings in the UK. 
 
These accomplishments represent our commitment to sustainability and creating positive impacts on our planet and communities. Together we can drive change for a better future.

Growing up in Morocco, my father always told me to ""be a good Moroccan ambassador wherever you are."" This principle has guided me throughout my life and career, and it resonates deeply with our mission at Zoetis.
From the time I was a little girl, I believed in being good and doing good in the world. This belief is more than a personal mantra but a professional commitment that I see reflected in everything we do at Zoetis. This month, we celebrate our commitment to nurturing the world and humankind by advancing care for animals. 
One of the many ways we live our purpose is through community engagements. Recently, our Zoetis Tech & Digital (ZTD) team participated in a dog toy-building event as part of our ongoing partnership with American Humane. Last month, our US Pet Care team partnered with American Humane to match $50,000 in contributions to support Pet Preparedness Month, helping animals in need during natural disasters. These events are a testament to our commitment to making a positive impact beyond our immediate work environment. They highlight the importance of collaboration and the joy of giving back to our communities.
I am proud to be part of a team that shares this dedication to purpose. Together, we strive to make a difference, guided by the values that have shaped us. Here's to continuing our journey of being good and doing good, every day!
