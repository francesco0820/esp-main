We encountered this requirement and took it as an opportunity to develop a parser capable of extracting point cloud data from #E57. Today, we are thrilled to announce that our parser is now publicly available on #npmjs. This opens up new possibilities for the #three.js #community, as developers can now easily integrate E57 data into their projects. For more information, please refer to the three-e57-loader on npmjs https://lnkd.in/dUhBfvcv“ For those unfamiliar with E57, it's a compact, #vendor-neutral file format that is widely used in the 3D #imaging industry for storing point clouds, images, and metadata produced by 3D imaging systems, such as laser scanners. This makes it a crucial tool for many applications, including 3D modeling, virtual reality, and more. With our new parser, working with E57 data in three.js has never been easier.We hope you find it useful for your projects. “ Reach out to us to learn more about how Prolincur can help you in your 3D journey. Visit our website https://prolincur.com, give us a call, or send us an email.

I gave a detailed presentation on the state of the software market as we see it today. Sharing here a couple of charts from that presentation that to me encapsulate the core of our firm's investment thesis and distinctive value proposition.  In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market ” now in its third decade ” continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital ” particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.","Digital Transformation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",,document,,Kristin,Nimsger,Thoma Bravo,Private Equity,Operating Partner,944,31,24,3w,,,,Kristin Nimsger Weston likes this,Likes,,2024-04-01 17:07,4/1/2024,Monday,Monday,5:07 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,999,Engagement,5pm-6pm,April 2024,

[1][2][5]Starting April 1, 2024, Microsoft will introduce a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that do not include the Teams collaboration app. [1][5] This means that customers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland will now have the option to purchase Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions without Teams.The changes come after the European Commission launched an investigation in 2020 into Microsoft's bundling of Teams with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 packages, which competitors like Slack argued was anti-competitive. [6] Microsoft subsequently unbundled Teams from its European offerings in 2023. [1][2]""Globally consistent licensing helps ensure clarity for customers and streamline decision making and negotiations,"" Microsoft said in its announcement. [5] The move will give customers more flexibility in choosing the productivity tools that best fit their needs, without being forced to pay for Teams if they don't want it.However, some industry observers argue that the change is ""too little, too late"" as Microsoft has already amassed millions of Teams users globally during the pandemic. [6] Nonetheless, the decoupling of Teams from Microsoft's core productivity suites will be welcomed by businesses looking to use alternative collaboration tools.[1] https://lnkd.in/gvhv5eK9] https://lnkd.in/gU9RV6qs] https://lnkd.in/gvH8w_SX] https://lnkd.in/gaYQrp7ZSources[1] Changes to MS Teams licensing structure as of October 1, 2023 https://lnkd.in/gVxqxHUs[2] Important Microsoft 365 licensing changes in Europe https://lnkd.in/gJVjmb5G[3] Microsoft Teams Rooms Device Licensing Changes - Diversified https://lnkd.in/gJSvgPzS[4] Update!

It will still be up to the competitors to figure out how counter with the way the MS Teams will still seamlessly integrate with M365 and the of Office 365 apps thar are pervasive with enterprise customers.Some of the competitors have done a good job of gaining a foothold into enterprises and earned trust during the challenge of the Pandemic.  I'll use Zoom as an example.  They have branded themselves as a communication & collaboration company but it's a challenge to get new business when customers say that they already have a MS Teams as part of their licensing they are paying for would rather figure out how to deploy that.Microsoft will definitely have to earn it but don't count them out as they will continue to put value into MS Teams.

With 2 custom objects and a flow, you can build your own Round Robin to evenly (or unevenly) distribute any kind of record to your team. Easy to maintain. Easy for users and managers.Quota: This is a big maybe for me on whether or not this should be built in Salesforce. Using the same framework, we have built really cool quota functionality that can quota off of opportunities, opportunity splits, revenue schedules, a custom object, etc. with different levels of quotas. (i.e. an individual quota rolls up to a team quota rolls up to a parent quota rolls up to a company quota). Both of these are really simple builds that will scale with you. So, the question always comes into play: Build or Buy. The answer is 'it depends,' but we have built out some really cool solutions for clients who chose to Build. We make recommendations, keep it simple and focus on user experience. That's where true expertise liesShoot me a note in the comments if you want to learn more about these.

Critics referencing #privacy concerns don't know what they're talking about. Why is it a stroke of genius? Because Chase will get paid twice. And merchants will pay twice. It's too funny. I've seen some criticism of this announcement from folks who think Chase will be selling customer data to advertisers. That's not how it will work. Instead, Chase will sell ad space on its digital properties to advertisers buying into Chase's pitch that the bank can improve ad targeting by analyzing the customer's spending patterns. It's a great move by Chase because they'll make $ by selling ad space and by generating more sales on its cards. It's an appealing deal for advertisers because--unlike other advertising approaches--they only pay when the customer makes a purchase. The irony is that when the purchase is made, the advertising firm not only pays for the ad, it pays the interchange fee on the card purchase. Another reason this is a stroke of genius is that the new advertising service could enable Chase to bundle--at some point--pricing for the advertising with interchange fees.The achilles heel here is that even Chase--as big as it is--doesn't have a 360-view of its customers' spending habits. Today's consumer spending behavior is so fragmented and specialized that it's likely that many Chase cardholders only use their Chase card for specific types of purchases--which will limit the range of advertisers any one cardholder will see.That might be a good thing, though--for both the cardholder and Chase. Might mean more relevant ads.From a broader banking industry perspective, this is an interesting move by Chase. Most of the community-based institutions I've talked to have historically been hesitant to--or outright against--putting 3rd party ads on their digital properties. And even if they want to do it, it begs the question how they would do it. Maybe a new service offering from a Q2, Alkami Technology, and/or NCR Voyix?https://lnkd.in/eyzCKudT#banking #marketing #digitalbankingMary Wisniewski Jason Henrichs ’¯ Jim Marous Alex Johnson Alex Jimenez Efi Pylarinou Al Dominick","Digital Transformation,Human-centered design",,news article,,Matthew ,Smith,Webster ,Banking,Chief Digital Banking Officer,201,55,14,2w,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/chase-bank-to-let-advertisers-target-customers-based-on-spending-data-275f8226?mod=hp_minor_pos1,Matthew Smith liked Rasha Katabiâ€™s comment on this,Liked a comment,,2024-04-05 00:41,4/5/2024,Friday,Friday,12:41 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,270,Engagement,12-1am,April 2024,

Yet, today, in 2024, there are still many companies using scanning and OCR solutions who THINK they are utilizing e-Invoicing. It's crazy that after this many years there is still so much confusion and misinformation on this topic.

The technology could get the airline 10ppt extra utilization across its entire network (worth over $100M per year in bottom line) but they could not get to that value until they got airport palletizing procedures to be optimized and cargo sales reps to use the technology in their day to day workflow. Both critical non-tech changes.For real value, it's #NeverJustTech - There is so much more to consider in order to maximize the performance of digital and AI solutions. Every time a new solutions gets introduced to optimize a process or a customer experience, there will likely be changes required upstream and downstream of that process as per my airline example. That's why business leaders must own the reimagination of that business process with technology AND also own the change management. It's also why such efforts are so often failing if they are tucked too low in the organization with managers who don't own the end-to-end process or if they are being pushed by IT. #McKinseyDigital #RewiredBook","Organizational Change Management,AI/Machine Learning,Digital Transformation",,video,,Frederico,Padliha,Capital One,Banking,Head of Strategy for Enterprise Product and Experience,75,4,3,2d,,,,Frederico Padilha likes this,Likes,,2024-04-23 01:18,4/23/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,1:18 AM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/3fbb18c6-fb75-41e2-876e-a9a1a8583948,,,,,,,,checked,,82,Engagement,1am-2am,April 2024,

I, for one, am amazed by what this advanced technology can do to make us water utility professionals more productive, efficient, accurate, and capable of doing things never done before. Trusted data sources, no and low code software, and AI-imbedded technologies coming together with meaningful impact.

It is a truly inclusive, enterprise-wide community of technologists here at Walgreens.  Why did I establish it?  I am passionate about discussing the latest technology trends and exploring how architecture can drive organizational success. However, merely discussing these topics without action lacks authenticity and credibility. 

The Architecture Assembly is a cross-cutting, weekly gathering designed not only for knowledge sharing but also to promote genuine collaboration and break down organizational silos. I was unsure if this initiative would succeed, knowing the challenges of sustaining interest once the initial novelty fades. I am pleased to report that after more than a year, not only has it endured, but it has flourished!

Yesterday, we hosted a dynamic community panel discussing the concept of a ""technology company"" and whether Walgreens aligns with that identity. Our panelists included practitioners from diverse backgrounds—some new to the company, others seasoned Walgreens veterans—ranging from engineers to product, and even a certified pharmacist! The insights gained from these engaging discussions of almost 200 of us were invaluable and have already paved the way for actionable next steps.

This inclusive community is essential for effecting real change and driving innovation. It exemplifies how architecture can empower our organization, not just in theory, but in practice.

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders… how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent… how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within… saving to reinvest

My response touched the following aspects:

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

#Proactive responsibility: Digital companies must set their own #responsibletechnology guardrails ahead of external mandates. As reference, this is the work my colleagues at Thoughtworks have done in collaboration with United Nations: https://lnkd.in/ex96xzHG

A breathless day comes to an end in the world of AI. It seems there a two broad camps: one that thinks GPT4o is a big step towards AGI and the other which thinks the live demo was a dud. I subscribe to neither. I have talked about my opinions on the demo itself in a previous post. Let's now get to specifics of how I think this affects our work at samvid.ai

I spent the better part of the day using GPT4o on the kinds of documents we see in our work. As I have mentioned in many other posts, transformers are perception devices and GPT4o is exactly that, the best perception machine in the market. It can now retrieve basic information from unstructured documents with a high degree of accuracy. Old GPT4 was pretty bad at this (why was RAG even a thing given this performance level?) and it took very little to confuse the model. GPT4o is a remarkable improvement on that. However, GPT4o is also showing signs of overfitting. Suppose facts A and B exist in a document with no apparent connection between them. The old GPT4 would have given a McKinsey-like answer with deliberate vagueness about this connection. GPT4o, on the other hand, will go out on a limb and claim there is no relationship between A and B despite the lack of evidence, a fact that may be obviously wrong when evaluated by a domain expert. 

All this is great for samvid.ai . Two thoughts come to mind:
1. My team and I have no interest in spending additional time retrieving basic information from documents. It always seemed like a waste of resources. Would rather focus on higher order problems.
2. The goal of samvid.ai is to unlock the latent knowledge in documents using our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences and use this knowledge for enterprise decision making. Literally nothing about this mission has changed. If anything, our value proposition has gotten stronger. 

It has been a glorious day. Onward and upward.

Squeezing run costs to try and keep up with upgrades and piling technological debt has been a fine and difficult balance to say the least.

Finally with the latest breakthroughs in AI, it is feasible to tame Run costs radically beyond the traditional outsourced managed services levers. But it will require companies to adopt AI as integral part of their workforce, not just another tool for more automation. Are CIOs ready for it?

I am impressed by the proactive role that Abu Dhabi is playing in digital, data management and AI to advance the transformation of healthcare delivery. I think their experience in modernising health systems will inspire countries not only in the region but also around the world.

It was my honour to meet H.H. Sheikh HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE on the sidelines of #AbuDhabiGlobalHealthcareWeek. I also had the pleasure of meeting  H.E. Mansour Ibrahim Al Mansouri, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Health, H.E. Dr. Ahmed AlKhazraji, FACHE , Executive Director of Strategy and Policy Sector, Abu Dhabi Department of Health, H.E. Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Minister of Health, Egypt, Adonis Georgiadis, Minister of Health, Greece, Jean Kaseya, Director General at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and other leaders. We had the opportunity to learn from one another and explore how we can better leverage public-private partnerships to improve health.
 
I am proud of the PHSSR’s significant milestone in launching the MENA’s first ‘Sustainability and Resilience in Health System’ report, dedicated to highlighting Abu Dhabi’s crisis-proof strategies for a resilient health system. I look forward to continue building momentum in strengthening health systems globally.

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry load’s carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now “Tide Cold Certified” – meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well – or even better – in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. It’s a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And we’re proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tide’s ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

Liz Kellogg, PhD, and her team are now utilizing a state-of-the-art microscope that is equipped with a “cold FEG” as an electron source, a SelectrisX energy filter and a Falcon 4i camera. These technologies will primarily be used for Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET), which seeks to understand the inner workings of cells by visualizing intricate biological structures with advanced image processing. 

“Having access to one of the best microscopes in the country enables our lab to gain deeper insights into the architecture and organization of genomes” says Kellogg.

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

The electrical grid is becoming more complex to manage as distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewables proliferate. Aging physical infrastructure, increasing extreme weather events, and a retiring utility workforce create a more challenging operating context that threatens utilities’ ability to reliably provide electricity to their customers. 

ThinkLabs’ autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs’ capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.

Powerhouse Ventures is proud to co-lead ThinkLabs’ $5M Seed with Active Impact Investments, with additional participation from Blackhorn Ventures, Amplify Capital, Mercuria, and a national US energy company. We look forward to working with Founder & CEO Josh Wong and the entire ThinkLabs team to build the digital backbone of the modern grid.
