"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not Digital Transformation
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question. Pierce denial. Pierce lies. Pierce the surface.hashtag#emotionalintelligencehashtag#purposehashtag#iqeqtqThis picture is a fair representation of how I look when I receive compliments. A lot happy.

"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not Digital Transformation

Because of this and because of Langdon, I have changed the direction of my life to helping those who suffer from mental health issues or those who care for them.Why am I posting this today? Today is Langdon's 23rd birthday, and I know he would not want someone to have to talk in hushed tones or feel alone. I don't know who said this, but there are many Suicide loss survivors who need to hear this.

"Ys Achieved Amazon Ads Retail Certification! YsE-commerce and retail media, in particular, have grown incredibly over the past couple of years. At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible. I loved diving deep into the Amazon Ads Retail Certification course where I learned about retail readiness, Amazon's fulfillment solutions, the different aspects of selling on Amazon.com, how to launch a new product on Amazon.com, as well as, navigating Seller Central and Vendor Central. I highly recommend this course for anyone in advertising and marketing who wants to understand e-commerce operations and advertising campaigns.

"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype.

"Hello, connections!I am sharing my project titled 'Sentiment Analysis on Brands'.The project performs Turkish Sentiment Analysis and includes the following stages:Data Collection: Instead of relying on a pre-existing dataset, I employed the Web Scraping technique to gather comments from the DonanAmHaber website.(I checked the robots.txt file on DonanAmHaber.)Natural Language Processing: I performed Turkish sentiment analysis with the collected comments, and in this stage, I had to employ a variety of different techniques. For text labeling, I used FLAN-T5 and OpenAI, for feature extraction, I utilized BERT, and for model training, I employed Keras.Sequential().Web Application with Flask: I developed a dynamic web application using Flask to visualize the results of the Sentiment Analysis with Apache ECharts graphics.You can review the project at https://lnkd.in/ds7tfKUV.

"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

It uses a factorized approach that not only allows us to train video generation models more efficiently but also produces higher quality video generations.The outputs of this model were preferred by 96% of respondents over our previous model based on output quality in human evaluations.2i a Emu EditThis new model is capable of free-form editing through text instructions. Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs "" the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"Meta AI just dropped EmuVideo, generating 4-second short videos at 512x512 resolution and 16 FPS. Idea is quite straightforward: text -> image first, then do a ""super-resolution"" of the image along the temporal axis to synthesize motion.Long-form videos, however, are still out of reach. I see short videos as a kind of ""system 1 thinking"": you don't need much reasoning to generate 4 seconds. But system-2 type video generation needs coherence, long-term memory, and much higher computational cost.Regardless, EmuVideo is still a big upgrade on the video diffusion quality.

Tools informed by data can help care providers recommend equally effective and more affordable medications, helping reduce financial barriers to care. Y Reimagined plans and experiences. Wearable devices can provide insights about our health, but the key is knowing what to do with that information. Resources offering real-time, actionable feedback can bring significant value and encourage healthier lifestyle decisions, especially when integrated with a comprehensive care plan. Y Strategic collaborations. Cultivating new relationships can help drive innovation and bring together novel approaches, offering an opportunity to scale solutions to maximize impact. One example is the UnitedHealthcare Accelerator, which helps early startups grow and facilitates a pathway for commercialization.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:Y Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. Y Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. YZ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. Yi  Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) Y Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology",Digital Transformation

"According to the National Institute for Medical Health, one in five US Adults live with a mental illness. At UHC, we've seen that almost 10% of our members who are looking at benefits in our app end up searching for mental health services. Jen Mahoney, Sandra Long and team are doing their best to provide our members with the help they need. At the end of last year, this team launched some very significant features for millions of members, such as:

Care Explorer - Helping members find the right wellness journey for their mental health. Members complete a survey to get personalized recommendations for care and providers. This helps members to start finding care for themselves and their dependents. 

Child and Family Coaching  Mental health matters for everyone, not just adults: it affects entire families. We think we can make a significant difference in the US by providing more mental health services for the whole family.

More availability, and simpler  more convenient access to behavioral health support  including quicker appointments and tailored therapy.

I am so proud of being able to work alongside brilliant and compassionate people like Sandra Long and Jen Mahoney (and the dozens of others who helped bring this to reality) - who are making it matter every day for millions of consumers!

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

However, digital transformation is not only about adopting new tools and systems (although an important aspect); it is also about changing the culture, processes, and mindset of an organization.

"So there's this new tool out there called Motif Analytics. To the extent that I understand it (which, you know, minimally), it's like regex for event data. They created a very specialized language for manipulating and analyzing events, so that you don't have to write some god-awful SQL query full of self-joins and window functions to figure out how often thing X happens after thing Y, without thing Z happening in between. SQL could do this, of course, but the writing a query like that would be long, tedious, and easy to mess up. Motif, by contrast, is precise and compact. If you knew how to use Motif - even if you didn't know it that well and had to frequently look up its syntax when you used it - it would be pretty silly to think, ""eh, forget it, I'll just use SQL instead, the queries are huge and I get them wrong all the time, but at least I don't have ever Google how do to anything."" The thing is, ever since ChatGPT came out, that's basically what we're trying to do to SQL itself? There are tons of companies and products that promise to replace SQL queries with English questions. But, English is to SQL was SQL is to Motif: A more verbose, more tedious, and less precise language that often makes doing a job *harder.* Imagine trying to describe some multi-step SQL query in English - or even just instructing a bot on how to do a join without using the word join. It'd be a nightmare. For fancy analyses, SQL isn't a necessary evil that computers need to understand us; it's a useful virtue that we need to tell computers what we want. So like, yeah, SQL chatbots are cool and all, and I'm sure one day they'll get quite good at writing SQL. But I'm not sure we'll ever want that, not because computers will need SQL to query a database, but because we won't be able to express ourselves in English.",Digital Transformation

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. It's easier than ever to build. (I'm currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning "" if I can do it, you can, too.)I'm excited to share with you what's next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name )

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. Thats all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model thats not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon?

"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
-  Gets trigged from a new hire event
-  Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-   Reasons over data to answer employee questions
-  Recommends personalized training based on employee background

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- Orchestration of complex tasks. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks.
- Memory and context. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time.
- Monitoring and improving. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks.
- Delegation with confidence and guardrails. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls.

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview.
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

"I have been applying to many internships for almost 9 months now and I have a couple of resumes based on the role. But at times, there is some specific technology that the job description mentions, which I have worked on but didnt add to my resume to avoid cluttering. At times, I also edit certain points based on the role. And while I store the multiple versions of my resume on my laptop, I like to keep the naming consistent and avoid the terms (2), copy, etc. However, I often have to create multiple folders to track which resume I submit for a particular company. This takes around 10-20 seconds for every application, and if I am submitting my resume with major edits for multiple roles, that takes some additional time. So, I built a short script in Python (I like to call it a mini-project!) to save some time for me. The way it works is - when I make the edits and download my resume, I ensure it is in the following format -FirstNameLastName_Resume_RoleName_Company. This script will create a folder based on the company name and then create a sub-folder for a specific role within the company, all while keeping the file name consistent (FirstNameLastName_Resume.pdf).
Here's a short demo of the same.

"Last year, McKinsey published, Rewired, The McKinsey Guide to Outcompeting in the Age of Digital and AI. This article summarizes some of the key points and research. I found it thought-provoking and it absolutely makes me want to dive into the full book.

Takeaways:
	Based on McKinseys research, companies with leading digital capabilities outperform those that are behind by two to six times on total shareholder returns. Great stat, but something that tech providers need to focus on in their individual projects is translating that general, apple pie statistic into hyper-relevant terms their customer can get excited about and help them measure and prove the value.
	McKinsey identifies six capability areas necessary for transformation: 1) Strategy, 2) Talent, 3) Operating Model, 4) Technology, 5) Data, and 6) Adoption and Scaling. The descriptions of each of these begin to clarify why digital transformation is so hard. Each area, taken on its own, is a big lift, and to truly achieve lasting competitive advantage, a business must address all six (Companies dont necessarily need to be exceptional in every capability, but they do need to hit a baseline of competency across all of them.) Truly developing a core competence around digital and AI is what I like to call a high degree of difficulty vault. High risk and high reward. Again, providers, what products and services can you provide that lower the risk?
	Of the six capabilities, McKinsey says, It is telling that the largest gaps are in creating a strategic road map to realize value and in adoption and scaling, as opposed to in technology: being successful in digital and AI is less about technological tools and more about how well business leaders align their organization. Ding ding ding.
	The most important point: As the authors write, Understanding what to do is one thing...these capabilities are well known to most executives. Understanding how to actually build those capabilities is another. Yes. This is a massive opportunity for tech providers. How can we more safely lead our clients through to realization of the value of technology? We dont need more/better thought leadership  we all get it! Imagine the value for a client in a provider that can clearly identify and mitigate those risks and partner with them to truly achieve lasting competitive advantage through digital transformation.

"Most B2B companies are still running their content strategy like it's 2012. Pushing whitepapers and webinars to drive MQLs is outdated, ineffective, and way too expensive. Here's why:

Metadata published a report analyzing $37M ad spend on lead gen campaigns.

The result: only 0.2%(!) of MQLs converted to closed-won deals. 

That means you need 500 leads to acquire a new customerwhich is painfully inefficient given the average cost per lead of $123.

The driving force behind this is the significant shift in buyer behavior:

1. Buyers now prefer to educate themselves at their own pace, diving deep into content to find solutions to their challenges (without giving up their email address or phone number in a lead form).

2. The buying journey has become more dynamic and unpredictable, with dark social channels playing a crucial role in how buyers gather information.

3. Buying committees have nearly tripled in size over the past decade, leading to longer sales cycles and a greater need for multiple touchpoints.

Your content strategy needs to reflect these changes. Here's how:

 Conduct interviews with your 10 best customers and analyze 20 recent sales call recordings to identify pain points and objections.

 Develop content pillars and topics that revolve around these pain points and objections.

 Identify 3-5 internal subject matter experts (SMEs) who are comfortable on camera and willing to build their LinkedIn presence. Preferably include 1-2 people from the executive team.

 Conduct bi-weekly interviews with each SME. Turn each interview recording into 1 long-form article, 4+ video clips and 10+ LinkedIn posts.

 Publish this content on the personal LinkedIn profiles of your SMEs (3-5x per week). Publish the article and video clips on the website, repurpose the interview recording for YouTube and create a weekly newsletter with the best insights from the interviews.

 After 2 months, start running LinkedIn Thought Leader Ads* to promote the top-performing LinkedIn posts to your target accounts.

*Paid social should mainly be used for content distribution, not lead generation. Would you rather pay $150 for 100 decision makers to read your case study, or $150 for just one person to maybe read your whitepaper?

 Roll out an employee advocacy program to turn the rest of your employees into an organic marketing channel.
