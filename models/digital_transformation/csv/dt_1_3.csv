"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work. To Raghuveer ., Atmaja Apsangi, Sumit Agrawal, Sombir Kadian, I extend my gratitude for fostering the Shark Idea Tank platform, a catalyst that expedited my innovation journey and exposed me to a realm of other ground-breaking ideas. Dattaraj Rao, your insightful articles have been a beacon of knowledge, enriching my understanding of Generative AI concepts. I'm grateful for your time and the opportunity to validate our approach last week. Yogish Pai, Thank you for always being there to support. Without your assistance, resolving issues in a timely manner would have been a Herculean task, making it challenging to complete our prototype within the tight timeframe of 2-3 weeks.","Product Development,AI/Machine Learning,Digital transformation",

"When I talk to people about our Center for Innovation Tech Hub, such as this group of American College of Healthcare Executives who visited our hospital this week, I liken it to both showcasing technology we currently use like a permanent exhibit at a museum and testing new solutions like a living laboratory for digital health. 

Some of the technology in the Tech Hub is still a few steps ahead of a hospital pilot roll-out such as our smart room capabilities to adjust room controls, nurse requests and more with the tap of a button. Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

It uses a factorized approach that not only allows us to train video generation models more efficiently but also produces higher quality video generations.The outputs of this model were preferred by 96% of respondents over our previous model based on output quality in human evaluations.2ï¸âƒ£ Emu EditThis new model is capable of free-form editing through text instructions. Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs â€” the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"I was honored to share my passion for analytics in a recent Forbes article highlighting three trends paving the way for transformation in health care. Hereâ€™s a recap: â¤ï¸ Personalized recommendations. Tools informed by data can help care providers recommend equally effective and more affordable medications, helping reduce financial barriers to care. ðŸ’¡ Reimagined plans and experiences. Wearable devices can provide insights about our health, but the key is knowing what to do with that information. Resources offering real-time, actionable feedback can bring significant value and encourage healthier lifestyle decisions, especially when integrated with a comprehensive care plan. ðŸ¤ Strategic collaborations. Cultivating new relationships can help drive innovation and bring together novel approaches, offering an opportunity to scale solutions to maximize impact. One example is the UnitedHealthcare Accelerator, which helps early startups grow and facilitates a pathway for commercialization. These approaches are driven by data and present a unique opportunity for us to make health care more equitable and affordable.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:ðŸŒŒ Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. ðŸ‘“ Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. ðŸŽ­ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. ðŸ•¶ï¸ Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) ðŸŒ Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology","Digital transformation,Innovation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",checked

The FDA now requires device manufacturers to disclose all possible vulnerabilities for all new submissions. But these new policies don’t impact 10s of thousands of devices already operating on the network. Provider organizations need better standards and reasonable resources to meet cyber performance goals to reduce patient safety risks. Toby shares the long list of medical devices that pose significant risk within the digital health environment and direct examples of the impact seen when these vulnerabilities are exploited.

Care Explorer - Helping members find the right wellness journey for their mental health. Members complete a survey to get personalized recommendations for care and providers. This helps members to start finding care for themselves and their dependents. 

Child and Family Coaching – Mental health matters for everyone, not just adults: it affects entire families. We think we can make a significant difference in the US by providing more mental health services for the whole family.

More availability, and simpler – more convenient access to behavioral health support – including quicker appointments and tailored therapy.

"The world has seen an extraordinary transformation in healthcare delivery, courtesy of the global pandemic. At Elevance Health, we are at the forefront of this change - witnessing a 3% YoY increase in virtual visits, topping 800k in 2023 alone!

Our recent study aimed to gauge consumers' perspectives on virtual healthcare. The results? A whopping 75% of consumers endorse virtual care, planning to continue and recommend these services. They appreciate the accessibility, earning an impressive 90% agreement that virtual care caters to those unable to physically visit a doctor, and 81% acknowledging the improvement in healthcare via integration of virtual care.

Inspired by these insightful findings, Elevance Health keeps evolving with a patient-centric approach, integrating care data, and optimizing virtual health interactions. With rising optimism and growing adoption rates, it's clear that we're only at the initial stage of a virtual care revolution.

"Texas Children's Hospital is set to become the first major children's hospital with a robust Virtual Nursing Network. In October, team members assembled to bring the vision for virtual nursing to life. We are so proud to offer this innovative service to our patients and families starting in the NICU  ðŸŽ‰â¤ï¸â€œInnovation is contagious, and nurses are especially primed for it,â€ said System Chief Nurse Executive Jackie Ward, DNP, RN, NE-BC, at our kickoff event last October, â€œThey are critical thinkers who get creative with solutions and look at problems from multiple anglesâ€¦they are tenacious and caring, constantly assessing situations to improve patient care.â€This innovative approach to patient and family care brings a virtual nurse to the clinical care team from a remote hub. Through virtual interactions, parents and caregivers can access supportive resources without bedside care interruptions. The virtual nursing care model allows for the removal of administrative tasks from the bedside nurse and takes family-centered care â€œbeyond the bedsideâ€ by offering coordinated, convenient support to patients using technology.â€œProtecting our teams from burnout continues to be a top priorityâ€¦with this redesign of duties, we can work to retain nurses who may have otherwise left the bedside and continue delivering compassionate care to familiesâ€ shared Ashley Simms, MBA, BSN, RN, NEA-BC, Assistant Vice President, Nursing.hashtag#healthcareinnovation hashtag#healthcareheroes hashtag#virtualnursing hashtag#OneAmazingTeam","Innovation,Digital transformation",

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"Digital transformation is a buzzword that often conjures up images of cutting-edge technologies. However, digital transformation is not only about adopting new tools and systems (although an important aspect); it is also about changing the culture, processes, and mindset of an organization. In fact, I've read many articles that argue that the human and organizational aspects of digital transformation are more important and challenging than the technological ones.I've had the pleasure of working alongside my leader Brett Brunick for close to a decade now and I've seen firsthand how he leads and takes on organizations and their old practices to achieve the transformation they need to compete with industry and succeed. Not only digitally, but culturally. I think of him as somewhat of an expert on this topic, so I wanted to share his words of wisdom directly in an article he penned for InformationWeek. https://lnkd.in/gw9snj4h",Digital transformation,checked

"When you shift your company from a project-led operating model to a product-led operating model, it necessitates a major overhaul to the way work gets done. When that doesn't happen, you see significant breakdowns and nothing ever gets made.One of the most common tensions occurs between product and IT when companies transform, and I love the way Ahana Roy Choudhury illustrates that in this article. Operating model transformation is critical to the success of digital transformation because the old â€œlinearâ€ organizational structures, initiative funding models, and siloed teams canâ€™t scale to support the kinds of customer-centric digital experiences companies are investing in.

"So there's this new tool out there called Motif Analytics. To the extent that I understand it (which, you know, minimally), it's like regex for event data. They created a very specialized language for manipulating and analyzing events, so that you don't have to write some god-awful SQL query full of self-joins and window functions to figure out how often thing X happens after thing Y, without thing Z happening in between. SQL could do this, of course, but the writing a query like that would be long, tedious, and easy to mess up. Motif, by contrast, is precise and compact. If you knew how to use Motif - even if you didn't know it that well and had to frequently look up its syntax when you used it - it would be pretty silly to think, ""eh, forget it, I'll just use SQL instead, the queries are huge and I get them wrong all the time, but at least I don't have ever Google how do to anything."" The thing is, ever since ChatGPT came out, that's basically what we're trying to do to SQL itself? There are tons of companies and products that promise to replace SQL queries with English questions. But, English is to SQL was SQL is to Motif: A more verbose, more tedious, and less precise language that often makes doing a job *harder.* Imagine trying to describe some multi-step SQL query in English - or even just instructing a bot on how to do a join without using the word join. It'd be a nightmare. For fancy analyses, SQL isn't a necessary evil that computers need to understand us; it's a useful virtue that we need to tell computers what we want. So like, yeah, SQL chatbots are cool and all, and I'm sure one day they'll get quite good at writing SQL. But I'm not sure we'll ever want that, not because computers will need SQL to query a database, but because we won't be able to express ourselves in English.","Data and Analytics,Digital transformation",checked

"Healthcare Entities are in Need of Secure and Efficient Digital Transformation: https://lnkd.in/gAEnFxyb The Change Healthcare breach has sparked debates on the necessary change in the healthcare industry, with some focusing on security solutions and others on AI. The irony lies in the duality of the challenge: healthcare organizations have not adequately addressed past threats yet continue to pursue new technology that they do not fully understand or can secure. This means CIOs and CISOs are together fighting a two-front war, as healthcare becomes more technology-driven and dependent on information, leading to increased risk and impact. A shift towards a more secure and efficient healthcare ecosystem is crucial for addressing the impact of this breach.For additional Healthcare Security & Technology insights from First Health Advisoryâ€™s Leadership sign up for First Health Fridays at https://lnkd.in/gW7T94Nu or contact us at sales@firsthealthadvisory.com to schedule a consultation.hashtag#EnterpriseRisk hashtag#ThirdPartyRisk hashtag#ThirPartyRiskManagement hashtag#HealthcareIT hashtag#HealthcareSecurity hashtag#HealthcareOrganization hashtag#CyberRiskManagement hashtag#DataSecurity hashtag#DigitalHealth hashtag#CyberRisk hashtag#RiskManagement hashtag#MedTech hashtag#HealthcareAI hashtag#AI","Digital transformation,AI/Machine Learning",

"Iâ€™ve never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services Iâ€™ve been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you canâ€™t access healthcare the way you should, itâ€™s terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldnâ€™t get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctorâ€™s office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. Iâ€™m especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI â€“ especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning â€“ was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate â€œdoctor speak,â€ to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. Itâ€™s easier than ever to build. (Iâ€™m currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning â€“ if I can do it, you can, too.)Iâ€™m excited to share with you whatâ€™s next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!). This next wave of innovation will be tremendous, and reminds me of some key technology epochs before.

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
📈 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
🖥 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
🏥 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
⌚ With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name 🤦🏽‍♂️)

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. That’s all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model that’s not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon? 😉

"Big news. Google just introduced a method to steal model information from black-box production language models like ChatGPT or PaLM-2.""Our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively.""They focus on the model's embedding projection layer, which is the last layer of the model. This layer is responsible for translating the internal representations of data (the ""hidden dimensions"") into a format that the model can use to make predictions or generate text.

"This is just incredible! The first human Neuralink patient, who is paralyzed, can now control a computer and play chess just by thinking 😳

29-year-old Noland Arbaugh was paralyzed below the shoulder after a diving accident. Thanks to the brain chip startup's device he can now do things that were not possible before. For example, gaming 🕹️

""I had basically given up playing that game,"" Arbaugh said, referring to the game Civilization VI, ""you all (Neuralink) gave me the ability to do that again and played for 8 hours straight.""

It's really inspiring to see how Neuralink has meaningfully improved the patient’s joy in life.

More importantly, we must be thankful to entrepreneurs like Elon for having the vision and initiative to push for these kinds of enhancements, for people that desperately deserve them.

The crazy part? This is just the very beginning.

""Even if someone has never had vision ever, like they were born blind, we believe that we can still restore vision using Neuralink"" - Elon Musk

What a time to be alive.
