"Delighted to announce that our idea with the prototype, ""Virtual Service Engineer powered by Generative AI,"" has clinched the top honors at the internal hackathon, also known as the Shark Idea Tank. This award was presented to us by our Chief Information Officer Jahid at our flagship SynerGE event. The core idea revolves around empowering service engineers to drastically reduce the time required to troubleshoot equipment malfunctions, all thanks to the remarkable capabilities of Generative AI. The Generative AI uses internal knowledge repository such as service manuals and problem solution database, to swiftly provide troubleshooting insights for customer-reported issues. This innovation promises to streamline the lives of our service engineers, sparing them the laborious task of sifting through voluminous PDFs in search of relevant solutions. We've harnessed the cutting-edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which marries a retrieval system for pinpointing essential documents through similarity-based search and a generation system for creating responses based on the retrieved information. For retrieval, we've adopted Amazon Kendra, the managed search service by AWS, while our generation capabilities are powered by the LLAMA2 7B model deployed within AWS SageMaker. In addition, we've used Langchain and Streamlit for creating our prototype. Although we created a working prototype, we also have a list of lessons learnt and technical challenges. The path forward is to enhance the accuracy by working through the technical challenges. I will capture those lessons in the next post.To Karthika .., Naveen Kumar G, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for your dedicated efforts in transforming this concept into a tangible prototype. Great work. To Raghuveer ., Atmaja Apsangi, Sumit Agrawal, Sombir Kadian, I extend my gratitude for fostering the Shark Idea Tank platform, a catalyst that expedited my innovation journey and exposed me to a realm of other ground-breaking ideas. Dattaraj Rao, your insightful articles have been a beacon of knowledge, enriching my understanding of Generative AI concepts. I'm grateful for your time and the opportunity to validate our approach last week. Yogish Pai, Thank you for always being there to support. Without your assistance, resolving issues in a timely manner would have been a Herculean task, making it challenging to complete our prototype within the tight timeframe of 2-3 weeks.",Digital Transformation

Other projects such as ambient intelligence monitors started out in Tech Hub but have since been implemented on some of our inpatient floors, yet we can continue to use the Tech Hub space to highlight this technology to other stakeholders without disrupting patient care.

Unlike many existing models, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions and ensures only specified elements of the input image are edited while leaving areas unrelated to instruction untouched. This enables more powerful and reliable editing and iteration.To train the model we developed a dataset containing 10M synthesized samples of input images, instructions and target outputs "" the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result the model demonstrates a new state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.While this work is still fundamental research, we see exciting potential for future cases for this technology to enhance the way we share, communicate and express ourselves in creative ways in our family of apps.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:Y Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. Y Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. YZ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. Yi  Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) Y Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology",Digital Transformation

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"Digital transformation is a buzzword that often conjures up images of cutting-edge technologies. However, digital transformation is not only about adopting new tools and systems (although an important aspect); it is also about changing the culture, processes, and mindset of an organization. In fact, I've read many articles that argue that the human and organizational aspects of digital transformation are more important and challenging than the technological ones.I've had the pleasure of working alongside my leader Brett Brunick for close to a decade now and I've seen firsthand how he leads and takes on organizations and their old practices to achieve the transformation they need to compete with industry and succeed. Not only digitally, but culturally. I think of him as somewhat of an expert on this topic, so I wanted to share his words of wisdom directly in an article he penned for InformationWeek. https://lnkd.in/gw9snj4h",Digital Transformation

"When you shift your company from a project-led operating model to a product-led operating model, it necessitates a major overhaul to the way work gets done. When that doesn't happen, you see significant breakdowns and nothing ever gets made.One of the most common tensions occurs between product and IT when companies transform, and I love the way Ahana Roy Choudhury illustrates that in this article. Operating model transformation is critical to the success of digital transformation because the old ""linear"" organizational structures, initiative funding models, and siloed teams can't scale to support the kinds of customer-centric digital experiences companies are investing in. In other words, you can't have one without the other.

"So there's this new tool out there called Motif Analytics. To the extent that I understand it (which, you know, minimally), it's like regex for event data. They created a very specialized language for manipulating and analyzing events, so that you don't have to write some god-awful SQL query full of self-joins and window functions to figure out how often thing X happens after thing Y, without thing Z happening in between. SQL could do this, of course, but the writing a query like that would be long, tedious, and easy to mess up. Motif, by contrast, is precise and compact. If you knew how to use Motif - even if you didn't know it that well and had to frequently look up its syntax when you used it - it would be pretty silly to think, ""eh, forget it, I'll just use SQL instead, the queries are huge and I get them wrong all the time, but at least I don't have ever Google how do to anything."" The thing is, ever since ChatGPT came out, that's basically what we're trying to do to SQL itself? There are tons of companies and products that promise to replace SQL queries with English questions. But, English is to SQL was SQL is to Motif: A more verbose, more tedious, and less precise language that often makes doing a job *harder.* Imagine trying to describe some multi-step SQL query in English - or even just instructing a bot on how to do a join without using the word join. It'd be a nightmare. For fancy analyses, SQL isn't a necessary evil that computers need to understand us; it's a useful virtue that we need to tell computers what we want. So like, yeah, SQL chatbots are cool and all, and I'm sure one day they'll get quite good at writing SQL. But I'm not sure we'll ever want that, not because computers will need SQL to query a database, but because we won't be able to express ourselves in English.",Digital Transformation

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. It's easier than ever to build. (I'm currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning "" if I can do it, you can, too.)I'm excited to share with you what's next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"While you were sleeping, OpenAI quietly introduced a Transformer Debugger (TDB)

Yay a TDB! What the %#*! is that?! 

Well, allow me to retort. Ever wondered how AI language models like GPT-2, 3 and 4 make sense of human language? OpenAI's new tool, the Transformer Debugger, is here to give you a peek inside!

What is TDB? (Catchy name )

Imagine having X-ray vision into the brain of an AI language model. TDB is like that - it lets you see how the model thinks and decides what to say next. It's a game-changer for anyone working with AI language models.

Why is TDB a Big Deal?

- Simplicity: You don't need to be a coding wizard to use it. TDB is designed for easy exploration.
- Insight: It helps you understand why the model behaves a certain way, making it easier to improve and trust AI systems.
- Innovation: While currently focused on smaller models(i.e GPT 2), TDB has the potential to unlock secrets in larger language models in the future.

Impact on Language Models:

Understanding AI language models is crucial for making them better, more transparent and reliable for everyone. TDB opens the door to a deeper understanding, leading to more accurate and trustworthy AI systems. Perhaps a step in the right direction which would allow explainable, reliable AI to become a true possibility. Thats all great and all,
OpenAI, can we now get a model thats not trained on copyrighted data? Too soon?

"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
-  Gets trigged from a new hire event
-  Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-   Reasons over data to answer employee questions
-  Recommends personalized training based on employee background

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- Orchestration of complex tasks. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks.
- Memory and context. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time.
- Monitoring and improving. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks.
- Delegation with confidence and guardrails. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls.

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview.
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

"I have been applying to many internships for almost 9 months now and I have a couple of resumes based on the role. But at times, there is some specific technology that the job description mentions, which I have worked on but didnt add to my resume to avoid cluttering. At times, I also edit certain points based on the role. And while I store the multiple versions of my resume on my laptop, I like to keep the naming consistent and avoid the terms (2), copy, etc. However, I often have to create multiple folders to track which resume I submit for a particular company. This takes around 10-20 seconds for every application, and if I am submitting my resume with major edits for multiple roles, that takes some additional time. So, I built a short script in Python (I like to call it a mini-project!) to save some time for me. The way it works is - when I make the edits and download my resume, I ensure it is in the following format -FirstNameLastName_Resume_RoleName_Company. This script will create a folder based on the company name and then create a sub-folder for a specific role within the company, all while keeping the file name consistent (FirstNameLastName_Resume.pdf).

"Last year, McKinsey published, Rewired, The McKinsey Guide to Outcompeting in the Age of Digital and AI. This article summarizes some of the key points and research. I found it thought-provoking and it absolutely makes me want to dive into the full book.

Takeaways:
	Based on McKinseys research, companies with leading digital capabilities outperform those that are behind by two to six times on total shareholder returns. Great stat, but something that tech providers need to focus on in their individual projects is translating that general, apple pie statistic into hyper-relevant terms their customer can get excited about and help them measure and prove the value.
	McKinsey identifies six capability areas necessary for transformation: 1) Strategy, 2) Talent, 3) Operating Model, 4) Technology, 5) Data, and 6) Adoption and Scaling. The descriptions of each of these begin to clarify why digital transformation is so hard. Each area, taken on its own, is a big lift, and to truly achieve lasting competitive advantage, a business must address all six (Companies dont necessarily need to be exceptional in every capability, but they do need to hit a baseline of competency across all of them.) Truly developing a core competence around digital and AI is what I like to call a high degree of difficulty vault. High risk and high reward. Again, providers, what products and services can you provide that lower the risk?
	Of the six capabilities, McKinsey says, It is telling that the largest gaps are in creating a strategic road map to realize value and in adoption and scaling, as opposed to in technology: being successful in digital and AI is less about technological tools and more about how well business leaders align their organization. Ding ding ding.
	The most important point: As the authors write, Understanding what to do is one thing...these capabilities are well known to most executives. Understanding how to actually build those capabilities is another. Yes. This is a massive opportunity for tech providers. How can we more safely lead our clients through to realization of the value of technology? We dont need more/better thought leadership  we all get it! Imagine the value for a client in a provider that can clearly identify and mitigate those risks and partner with them to truly achieve lasting competitive advantage through digital transformation.

"Most B2B companies are still running their content strategy like it's 2012. Pushing whitepapers and webinars to drive MQLs is outdated, ineffective, and way too expensive. Here's why:

Metadata published a report analyzing $37M ad spend on lead gen campaigns.

The result: only 0.2%(!) of MQLs converted to closed-won deals. 

That means you need 500 leads to acquire a new customerwhich is painfully inefficient given the average cost per lead of $123.

The driving force behind this is the significant shift in buyer behavior:

1. Buyers now prefer to educate themselves at their own pace, diving deep into content to find solutions to their challenges (without giving up their email address or phone number in a lead form).

2. The buying journey has become more dynamic and unpredictable, with dark social channels playing a crucial role in how buyers gather information.

3. Buying committees have nearly tripled in size over the past decade, leading to longer sales cycles and a greater need for multiple touchpoints.

_____

Your content strategy needs to reflect these changes. Here's how:

 Conduct interviews with your 10 best customers and analyze 20 recent sales call recordings to identify pain points and objections.

 Develop content pillars and topics that revolve around these pain points and objections.

 Identify 3-5 internal subject matter experts (SMEs) who are comfortable on camera and willing to build their LinkedIn presence. Preferably include 1-2 people from the executive team.

 Conduct bi-weekly interviews with each SME. Turn each interview recording into 1 long-form article, 4+ video clips and 10+ LinkedIn posts.

 Publish this content on the personal LinkedIn profiles of your SMEs (3-5x per week). Publish the article and video clips on the website, repurpose the interview recording for YouTube and create a weekly newsletter with the best insights from the interviews.

 After 2 months, start running LinkedIn Thought Leader Ads* to promote the top-performing LinkedIn posts to your target accounts.

*Paid social should mainly be used for content distribution, not lead generation. Would you rather pay $150 for 100 decision makers to read your case study, or $150 for just one person to maybe read your whitepaper?

 Roll out an employee advocacy program to turn the rest of your employees into an organic marketing channel.
