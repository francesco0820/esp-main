https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulerio/,"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents 🚀

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
- 📤 Gets trigged from a new hire event
- 👋 Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-  📊 Reasons over data to answer employee questions
- 📚 Recommends personalized training based on employee background

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks.
- 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time.
- 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴. Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks.
- 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls.

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview.
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mastephen/,"I have been applying to many internships for almost 9 months now and I have a couple of resumes based on the role. But at times, there is some specific technology that the job description mentions, which I have worked on but didn’t add to my resume to avoid cluttering. At times, I also edit certain points based on the role. And while I store the multiple versions of my resume on my laptop, I like to keep the naming consistent and avoid the terms (2), copy, etc. However, I often have to create multiple folders to track which resume I submit for a particular company. This takes around 10-20 seconds for every application, and if I am submitting my resume with major edits for multiple roles, that takes some additional time. So, I built a short script in Python (I like to call it a mini-project!) to save some time for me. The way it works is - when I make the edits and download my resume, I ensure it is in the following format -FirstNameLastName_Resume_RoleName_Company. This script will create a folder based on the company name and then create a sub-folder for a specific role within the company, all while keeping the file name consistent (FirstNameLastName_Resume.pdf).
Here's a short demo of the same.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandy-brown-03b6277/,"Last year, McKinsey published, 𝚁̲𝚎̲𝚠̲𝚒̲𝚛̲𝚎̲𝚍̲,̲ ̲𝚃̲𝚑̲𝚎̲ ̲𝙼̲𝚌̲𝙺̲𝚒̲𝚗̲𝚜̲𝚎̲𝚢̲ ̲𝙶̲𝚞̲𝚒̲𝚍̲𝚎̲ ̲𝚝̲𝚘̲ ̲𝙾̲𝚞̲𝚝̲𝚌̲𝚘̲𝚖̲𝚙̲𝚎̲𝚝̲𝚒̲𝚗̲𝚐̲ ̲𝚒̲𝚗̲ ̲𝚝̲𝚑̲𝚎̲ ̲𝙰̲𝚐̲𝚎̲ ̲𝚘̲𝚏̲ ̲𝙳̲𝚒̲𝚐̲𝚒̲𝚝̲𝚊̲𝚕̲ ̲𝚊̲𝚗̲𝚍̲ ̲𝙰̲𝙸̲. This article summarizes some of the key points and research. I found it thought-provoking and it absolutely makes me want to dive into the full book.

Takeaways:
•	Based on McKinsey’s research, companies with leading digital capabilities outperform those that are behind by two to six times on total shareholder returns. Great stat, but something that tech providers need to focus on in their individual projects is 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥, 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐢𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐫-𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐬 their customer can get excited about and help them measure and prove the value.
•	McKinsey identifies six capability areas necessary for transformation: 1) Strategy, 2) Talent, 3) Operating Model, 4) Technology, 5) Data, and 6) Adoption and Scaling. The descriptions of each of these begin to clarify why digital transformation is so hard. Each area, taken on its own, is a big lift, and to truly achieve lasting competitive advantage, a business must address all six (“Companies don’t necessarily need to be exceptional in every capability, but they do need to hit a baseline of competency across all of them.”) Truly developing a core competence around digital and AI is what I like to call a “high degree of difficulty vault.” High risk and high reward. Again, 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬, 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐤?
•	Of the six capabilities, McKinsey says, “It is telling that the largest gaps are in creating a strategic road map to realize value and in adoption and scaling, as opposed to in technology: 𝐛𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.” Ding ding ding.
•	The most important point: As the authors write, “Understanding what to do is one thing…these capabilities are well known to most executives. Understanding how to actually build those capabilities is another.” Yes. This is a massive opportunity for tech providers. How can we more safely lead our clients through to realization of the value of technology? We don’t need more/better thought leadership – we all get it! 𝐈𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚 𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲 𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐤𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,"Most B2B companies are still running their content strategy like it's 2012. Pushing whitepapers and webinars to drive MQLs is outdated, ineffective, and way too expensive. Here's why:

Metadata published a report analyzing $37M ad spend on lead gen campaigns.

The result: only 0.2%(!) of MQLs converted to closed-won deals. 

That means you need 500 leads to acquire a new customer—which is painfully inefficient given the average cost per lead of $123.

The driving force behind this is the significant shift in buyer behavior:

1. Buyers now prefer to educate themselves at their own pace, diving deep into content to find solutions to their challenges (without giving up their email address or phone number in a lead form).

2. The buying journey has become more dynamic and unpredictable, with dark social channels playing a crucial role in how buyers gather information.

3. Buying committees have nearly tripled in size over the past decade, leading to longer sales cycles and a greater need for multiple touchpoints.

_____

Your content strategy needs to reflect these changes. Here's how:

✅ Conduct interviews with your 10 best customers and analyze 20 recent sales call recordings to identify pain points and objections.

✅ Develop content pillars and topics that revolve around these pain points and objections.

✅ Identify 3-5 internal subject matter experts (SMEs) who are comfortable on camera and willing to build their LinkedIn presence. Preferably include 1-2 people from the executive team.

✅ Conduct bi-weekly interviews with each SME. Turn each interview recording into 1 long-form article, 4+ video clips and 10+ LinkedIn posts.

✅ Publish this content on the personal LinkedIn profiles of your SMEs (3-5x per week). Publish the article and video clips on the website, repurpose the interview recording for YouTube and create a weekly newsletter with the best insights from the interviews.

✅ After 2 months, start running LinkedIn Thought Leader Ads* to promote the top-performing LinkedIn posts to your target accounts.

*Paid social should mainly be used for content distribution, not lead generation. Would you rather pay $150 for 100 decision makers to read your case study, or $150 for just one person to maybe read your whitepaper?

✅ Roll out an employee advocacy program to turn the rest of your employees into an organic marketing channel.
