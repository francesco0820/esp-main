"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not Digital Transformation,0
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question. Pierce denial. Pierce lies. Pierce the surface.hashtag#emotionalintelligencehashtag#purposehashtag#iqeqtqThis picture is a fair representation of how I look when I receive compliments. A lot happy.

"Thoma Bravo's Annual Meeting wrapped up last week in Miami and it's always a great opportunity to share perspectives with our LPs and answer probing questions that investors rightly ask, as we together aim to make sense of an extraordinarily complicated  and incredibly interesting  business environment in 2024 and beyond.  I gave a detailed presentation on the state of the software market as we see it today. Sharing here a couple of charts from that presentation that to me encapsulate the core of our firm's investment thesis and distinctive value proposition.  In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market  now in its third decade  continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital  particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.","Digital Transformation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",1
"Microsoft Teams Decouples from Office 365 GloballyIn a move that will be welcomed by many businesses, Microsoft has announced that it is extending the changes it made to Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licensing in Europe to the rest of the world. [1][2][5]Starting April 1, 2024, Microsoft will introduce a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that do not include the Teams collaboration app. [1][5] This means that customers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland will now have the option to purchase Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions without Teams.The changes come after the European Commission launched an investigation in 2020 into Microsoft's bundling of Teams with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 packages, which competitors like Slack argued was anti-competitive. [6] Microsoft subsequently unbundled Teams from its European offerings in 2023.

"2 tools that I see companies buying all the time that they may not need: Round Robin and Quota.Round Robin:This is a pretty easy one to build in Salesforce. With 2 custom objects and a flow, you can build your own Round Robin to evenly (or unevenly) distribute any kind of record to your team. Easy to maintain. Easy for users and managers.Quota: This is a big maybe for me on whether or not this should be built in Salesforce. Using the same framework, we have built really cool quota functionality that can quota off of opportunities, opportunity splits, revenue schedules, a custom object, etc. with different levels of quotas. (i.e. an individual quota rolls up to a team quota rolls up to a parent quota rolls up to a company quota). Both of these are really simple builds that will scale with you. So, the question always comes into play: Build or Buy. The answer is 'it depends,' but we have built out some really cool solutions for clients who chose to Build. We make recommendations, keep it simple and focus on user experience. That's where true expertise liesShoot me a note in the comments if you want to learn more about these.

"JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s new Chase Media Solutions unit is a stroke of genius. Critics referencing #privacy concerns don't know what they're talking about. Why is it a stroke of genius? Because Chase will get paid twice. And merchants will pay twice. It's too funny. I've seen some criticism of this announcement from folks who think Chase will be selling customer data to advertisers. That's not how it will work. Instead, Chase will sell ad space on its digital properties to advertisers buying into Chase's pitch that the bank can improve ad targeting by analyzing the customer's spending patterns. It's a great move by Chase because they'll make $ by selling ad space and by generating more sales on its cards. It's an appealing deal for advertisers because--unlike other advertising approaches--they only pay when the customer makes a purchase. The irony is that when the purchase is made, the advertising firm not only pays for the ad, it pays the interchange fee on the card purchase. Another reason this is a stroke of genius is that the new advertising service could enable Chase to bundle--at some point--pricing for the advertising with interchange fees.The achilles heel here is that even Chase--as big as it is--doesn't have a 360-view of its customers' spending habits. Today's consumer spending behavior is so fragmented and specialized that it's likely that many Chase cardholders only use their Chase card for specific types of purchases--which will limit the range of advertisers any one cardholder will see.That might be a good thing, though--for both the cardholder and Chase. Might mean more relevant ads.From a broader banking industry perspective, this is an interesting move by Chase. Most of the community-based institutions I've talked to have historically been hesitant to--or outright against--putting 3rd party ads on their digital properties. And even if they want to do it, it begs the question how they would do it. Maybe a new service offering from a Q2, Alkami Technology, and/or NCR Voyix?https://lnkd.in/eyzCKudT#banking #marketing #digitalbankingMary Wisniewski Jason Henrichs   Jim Marous Alex Johnson Alex Jimenez Efi Pylarinou Al Dominick","Digital Transformation,Human-centered design",0

It was defined as the paperless processing of structured, electronic invoice data taken right from the source in the billing application of the supplier to the buyer's ERP system in a fully compliant way without media breaks.

Yet, today, in 2024, there are still many companies using scanning and OCR solutions who THINK they are utilizing e-Invoicing.

"A few years ago I worked with an airline to improve the utilization of the commercial cargo with very nifty AI-based Revenue Management solutions. The technology could get the airline 10ppt extra utilization across its entire network (worth over $100M per year in bottom line) but they could not get to that value until they got airport palletizing procedures to be optimized and cargo sales reps to use the technology in their day to day workflow.

Every time a new solutions gets introduced to optimize a process or a customer experience, there will likely be changes required upstream and downstream of that process as per my airline example.

"During the presentation of my upcoming book, #FigureEight, at HITEC Summit last week, an audience member asked for my take on #AI and #technology regulation. My response touched the following aspects:

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

#Proactive responsibility: Digital companies must set their own #responsibletechnology guardrails ahead of external mandates. As reference, this is the work my colleagues at Thoughtworks have done in collaboration with United Nations: https://lnkd.in/ex96xzHG

The future of #brand equity: In today's era, where technology augments every aspect of customer and employee experiences, responsible tech practices are the cornerstone of brand equity.

"Phew! A breathless day comes to an end in the world of AI. It seems there a two broad camps: one that thinks GPT4o is a big step towards AGI and the other which thinks the live demo was a dud. I subscribe to neither. I have talked about my opinions on the demo itself in a previous post. Let's now get to specifics of how I think this affects our work at samvid.ai

I spent the better part of the day using GPT4o on the kinds of documents we see in our work. As I have mentioned in many other posts, transformers are perception devices and GPT4o is exactly that, the best perception machine in the market. It can now retrieve basic information from unstructured documents with a high degree of accuracy. Old GPT4 was pretty bad at this (why was RAG even a thing given this performance level?) and it took very little to confuse the model. GPT4o is a remarkable improvement on that. However, GPT4o is also showing signs of overfitting. Suppose facts A and B exist in a document with no apparent connection between them. The old GPT4 would have given a McKinsey-like answer with deliberate vagueness about this connection. GPT4o, on the other hand, will go out on a limb and claim there is no relationship between A and B despite the lack of evidence, a fact that may be obviously wrong when evaluated by a domain expert. 

All this is great for samvid.ai . Two thoughts come to mind:
1. My team and I have no interest in spending additional time retrieving basic information from documents. It always seemed like a waste of resources. Would rather focus on higher order problems.
2. The goal of samvid.ai is to unlock the latent knowledge in documents using our #sootras, #neeyums and #essences and use this knowledge for enterprise decision making. Literally nothing about this mission has changed. If anything, our value proposition has gotten stronger. 

It has been a glorious day. Onward and upward.

"CIOs have had it tough for the last decade. Ever increasing pressure to cut costs while technology continued to leapfrog put them in difficult spot. Squeezing run costs to try and keep up with upgrades and piling technological debt has been a fine and difficult balance to say the least.

Finally with the latest breakthroughs in AI, it is feasible to tame Run costs radically beyond the traditional outsourced managed services levers. But it will require companies to adopt AI as integral part of their workforce, not just another tool for more automation. Are CIOs ready for it?

And are we, the entire IT service provider industry braced for the disruption and crash in demand for traditional IT resources if our clients take such a leap of faith.  When 6th graders can write entire applications using Java, Python, and cloud stacks all via AI tools using simple English prompts, programmer demand is set to plummet. With platforms building in GenAI based configuration, demand for functional consultants should decline. Is it going to be all about envisioning and prompt engineering?","AI/Machine Learning,Digital Transformation",1

"One of Procter & Gamble's strategic priorities is to lead with deep consumer insights, which help us deliver breakthrough innovations and superior products that better peoples everyday lives. 

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry loads carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now Tide Cold Certified  meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well  or even better  in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. Its a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And were proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tides ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

"As we envision the future of gene editing, St. Jude is committed to investing in top-tier technologies to better understand the molecular processes of rearranging the genome in translational studies. The St. Jude Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) Center in the Department of Structural Biology enables researchers to visualize intricate biological macromolecules with unprecedented detail and clarity.   It is staffed by expert scientists who provide extensive support and training to investigators at all levels and over the complete workflow for single-particle cryo-EM, from sample preparation to data collection, image processing, 3D reconstruction and modeling. 

Liz Kellogg, PhD, and her team are now utilizing a state-of-the-art microscope that is equipped with a cold FEG as an electron source, a SelectrisX energy filter and a Falcon 4i camera. These technologies will primarily be used for Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET), which seeks to understand the inner workings of cells by visualizing intricate biological structures with advanced image processing. 

Having access to one of the best microscopes in the country enables our lab to gain deeper insights into the architecture and organization of genomes says Kellogg. 

This is just the beginning for the Kellogg lab as they seek to understand the molecular processes capable of rearranging the genome and potentially harnessing these processes in translational studies.","Innovation,Digital Transformation",1

" At Lumos, we raised a $35m Series B from Scale Venture Partners with Andreessen Horowitz, Neo and Harpoon Ventures participating. 

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.
