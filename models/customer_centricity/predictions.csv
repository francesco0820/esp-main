Here's a recap: ai  Personalized recommendations. Tools informed by data can help care providers recommend equally effective and more affordable medications, helping reduce financial barriers to care. Y Reimagined plans and experiences. Wearable devices can provide insights about our health, but the key is knowing what to do with that information. Resources offering real-time, actionable feedback can bring significant value and encourage healthier lifestyle decisions, especially when integrated with a comprehensive care plan. Y Strategic collaborations. Cultivating new relationships can help drive innovation and bring together novel approaches, offering an opportunity to scale solutions to maximize impact. One example is the UnitedHealthcare Accelerator, which helps early startups grow and facilitates a pathway for commercialization. These approaches are driven by data and present a unique opportunity for us to make health care more equitable and affordable.

"It was 7 years back, when we were sitting in a meeting room at Lenskart.com office in Okhla Delhi, debating if we should invest in increasing delivery speed beyond 5-7 days. There were mixed thoughts in the room. Few suggested we should benchmark US companies. The team came back with the finding that most global companies are committing 7 days delivery time. Another suggestion was to run a consumer survey to know what % of people want glasses urgently - less than 10% wanted glasses urgently. And as always we ran an A/B test to see increase in revenue, csat.At lenskart, we have had a  fundamental belief from the early days that 'good is not good enough'..i.e. what is good for customers today will not be good tomorrow, as everyone wants to raise their quality of life with time. It is not a question of satisfaction but delight!Long story short, after a lot of analysis and paralysis, none of which clearly suggested investing in faster delivery, we went with our philosophy and took a goal of 3 days delivery...In 2022 we launched 3 days delivery in 8 cities. We kept looking for revenue impact, but we could not find a huge difference. We went against data and decided to take it to the next level, by launching this across 55 cities with a promise of 3 or Free....if you don't get your glasses in 3 days, we will give 50% cash back. While we still could not correlate this to sales growth, we saw that our customer support centre had a huge call increase with queries on 3 or Free... I was finally delighted that customers are talking about this...It is these queues that have always mattered to us more than revenue :)Last year, I already started seeding  the idea of Next-Day delivery in the FY24 Vision Document. The initial reaction of the team was that this is not possible and few rightfully questioned the ROI. Just like last time, we again ran some analysis, but this time the mandate was clear, we need to do it...because remember...good is not good enough :)Finally, we launched Next Day delivery in 4 cities this March 24 (yay)...an incredible work by LensKart Team ...you can order prescription glasses up to 9 pm, and we deliver next day. What looked impossible, especially in a model like ours, where every glass is custom manufactured & shipped from a central factory, became possible and that too profitably without raising cost/ order. And since the last few weeks, I get 100s of messages every day from delighted customers ...a great queue :)In Jan, teams started talking about 10 min delivery. And last week we launched #hustlr on 10 min delivery on Blinkit with support of Albinder Dhindsa & we created a special series for cricket fans to support their team..you must try..these #hustlr are just awesome   & blinkit 10m is  2 Our quality of lives are improving and I believe Indian companies are defining the new standards of customer delight for the globe #domorebemore#makeinindiap.s most eyewear companies globally still commit 7 day delivery",Customer Centricity,1,1

"We had the privilege of spending the day immersed in the world of data economics with the Dean of Big Data himself Bill Schmarzo. To say we learned a lot is an understatement. Some key takeaways:1. It's not about being data driven, it's about being value driven.2. Design thinking and data science are 2 sides of the same coin. By applying design thinking methodologies, such as empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration, organizations can develop data-driven solutions that truly resonate with users and deliver value.3. Focus on 10% of your data that has 90% of the value. When breaking down business problems into desired outcomes and KPI's, you will start to notice the same KPI's coming up over and over again. Focus on those KPI's.4. AI initiatives need to start small and address a real business problem. 5. Let your voice be heard as the world of AI evolves. It's not too late to affect change. Write to legislators. Stay educated. Highly recommend Bill's books especially "" The Economics of Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation'.

"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.
