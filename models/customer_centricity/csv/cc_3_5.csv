Banks only buy a core banking system when they have absolutely no alternative. Buying a new core for a transformation is like having a heart transplant. You simply don't do it unless you're going to die otherwise. No one goes down the shops and peruses the latest models of ˜hearts' because they fancy the latest model, or want to run a marathon a couple minutes faster. We need to be honest and acknowledge that some purchases are not driven by benefit, but by necessity. In those cases sales and marketing can't create need, they can only service it and prove their solution superior when it arises.

As we've broken out of our initial customer base and started to serve these great companies, we've found the need to becoming a filtering engine show each member of the Sales team 5-10 real-time alerts that are relevant to them.This boils down to a few things.ICP Fit. Is this company a company that looks like other companies who have bought from us? The simple metric that most people start with is # of employees, but it turns out that there's lots of other enrichment data that tends to be valuable.

There were mixed thoughts in the room. Few suggested we should benchmark US companies. The team came back with the finding that most global companies are committing 7 days delivery time. Another suggestion was to run a consumer survey to know what % of people want glasses urgently - less than 10% wanted glasses urgently. And as always we ran an A/B test to see increase in revenue, csat.At lenskart, we have had a  fundamental belief from the early days that 'good is not good enough'..i.e. what is good for customers today will not be good tomorrow, as everyone wants to raise their quality of life with time. It is not a question of satisfaction but delight!Long story short, after a lot of analysis and paralysis, none of which clearly suggested investing in faster delivery, we went with our philosophy and took a goal of 3 days delivery...In 2022 we launched 3 days delivery in 8 cities. We kept looking for revenue impact, but we could not find a huge difference. We went against data and decided to take it to the next level, by launching this across 55 cities with a promise of 3 or Free....if you don't get your glasses in 3 days, we will give 50% cash back. While we still could not correlate this to sales growth, we saw that our customer support centre had a huge call increase with queries on 3 or Free... I was finally delighted that customers are talking about this...It is these queues that have always mattered to us more than revenue :)Last year, I already started seeding  the idea of Next-Day delivery in the FY24 Vision Document. The initial reaction of the team was that this is not possible and few rightfully questioned the ROI. Just like last time, we again ran some analysis, but this time the mandate was clear, we need to do it...because remember...good is not good enough :)Finally, we launched Next Day delivery in 4 cities this March 24 (yay)...an incredible work by LensKart Team ...you can order prescription glasses up to 9 pm, and we deliver next day. What looked impossible, especially in a model like ours, where every glass is custom manufactured & shipped from a central factory, became possible and that too profitably without raising cost/ order. And since the last few weeks, I get 100s of messages every day from delighted customers ...a great queue :)In Jan, teams started talking about 10 min delivery. And last week we launched #hustlr on 10 min delivery on Blinkit with support of Albinder Dhindsa & we created a special series for cricket fans to support their team..you must try..these #hustlr are just awesome ˜ & blinkit 10m is ˜² Our quality of lives are improving and I believe Indian companies are defining the new standards of customer delight for the globe #domorebemore#makeinindiap.s most eyewear companies globally still commit 7 day delivery",Customer Centricity,,Personal/Public Pictures,,Ajay,Soni,Citi,Banking,SVP of Technology,25150,826,132,1w,,,,Ajay Soni likes this,Likes,,2024-04-14 13:20,4/14/2024,Sunday,Sunday,1:20 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,26108,Engagement,1pm-2pm,April 2024,

He loves backing outsiders who spot a new path.The key to taking down an incumbent is to force a choice, not a comparison.People don't want something incrementally better. They don't switch because of a comparison, but because they see something radically different.Think about orthogonal asymmetric attacks ” disorient the incumbents, do the opposite of convention, both in the what (the product) and the how (the business model).Business is always a fight. The fight tilts in favor of the startup when it takes the competitive initiative to rewrite the rules of what customers can expect.”Mike leverages the sword and the shield mental model from Clayton Christensen when working with startups going up against incumbents.Shield: Your go-to-market strategy is so different, the customer context you're targeting is so different, that the incumbent doesn't feel the incentive to attack you. This is the shield that gives you time to perfect the technology.Sword: Your sword is then the skills you build with this time that the incumbent lacks. By the time the incumbent realizes you're a threat, your skills are too asymmetric.”One key aspect in the early days, especially in markets with incumbents, is not to waste time with customers who don't value your advantage. They'll ask you for requirements that don't matter for creating a different future because they're conventional thinkers in the present.Many founders are so desperate to show growth that they will take on any customer. Mike instead advises founders to instead select your customers, don't let them pick you. He'd rather founders go slow to find the desperate customers. Once you've got them, you don't have to throw money at the problem of growth ” you only have to syndicate the truth.Real growth is the accelerated accumulation of attractive customers desperate for your advantage.”Next up: Mike's perspective on building early stage teams.

A succinct, bold, 1-2 sentence statement that describes the change your company wants to make in the world.

That’s a company vision, not a product vision.

A product vision, on the other hand, is a ""detailed enough"" description of the actual solution you intend to build, over time, in order to realize the company vision. 

Here are some examples of great company visions: 
- Stripe: Increase the GDP of the internet
- Google: Provide access to the world’s information in one click
- LinkedIn: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce 

Hopefully, it’s clear that none of these provide any meaningful product vision or direction.

For example, Google's product people could have pursued the company vision by building a universally accessible, multimedia encyclopedia. That would have been one product vision (anyone remember Microsoft Encarta?).

Or, they could have envisioned a better search engine and gotten to work on that. 

Product visions can take many formats, from a simple “written story” that describes a customer’s experience with the future product, to a “visiontype” comprised of (often annotated) mock-ups of the key elements of the product.

All good product visions, regardless of the format are:
- inspiring
- customer-centric
- successful at bringing the solution to life, at least in broad strokes. 

Speaking of broad strokes — good product visions are clear without being overly prescriptive. They are directive enough to provide a solid “north star” for the product team(s) to work towards, while challenging those teams to figure out the details over time.

Does your company have a true product vision, or are you under the illusion that your company vision is enough?","Product Development,Customer Centricity",,infographic,,Franscisco,Trejo,Caterpillar,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Head of Global eCommerce, CAT Digital at Caterpillar Inc.",252,17,10,3w,,,,Francisco Trejo likes this,Likes,,2024-05-06 10:23,5/6/2024,Monday,Monday,10:23 AM,,,,,,,,,,,279,Engagement,10am-11am,May 2024,checked

Not surprisingly, while a lot of customers still prefer face-to-face interaction, digital banking is so convenient and accessible! It also helps customers budget better, doesn’t restrict them to any geographical boundaries and is now becoming increasingly customizable. 

I’d like to hear from you in the comments, do you agree with the trends?

You just appreciate the fact it’s there when you need it.
 
A seamless #SupplyChain is key to our mission to deliver everyday moments of care when people need them most. And there are so many behind-the-scenes links that make up this supply chain. It starts with our trusted suppliers. 
 
It’s not every day you have the opportunity to gather so many incredible companies in the same room, but that’s exactly what we did when we launched our new supplier program this week. Not only did we introduce leaders from key suppliers to Kenvue as a stand-alone company, giving the event an extra-special energy, but around every corner we found new ways to grow together, including supporting our Healthy Lives Mission. We’re leaving that room with a shared vision for the future.
 
I have every confidence in our ability execute with excellence and meaningfully impact consumers. A huge thank you to Paula Davila Martinez and Alexandra Tarmo for your outstanding leadership in bringing this important event to life, and as always to my fellow leaders, Thibaut Mongon, Jan Meurer, Luani Alvarado, Charmaine England, Caroline Tillett, Paul Ruh, and Bernardo Tavares this is just the beginning.

Do you know it?

A market researcher trained in psychometrics was hired in the 80s by Campbell Soup. His task was to help identify the “perfect” flavor for Prego brand spaghetti sauce (which was getting beat in the market by Ragu). 

Instead of a single, better-than-Ragu sauce, the researcher identified distinct clusters of customer preferences. His results led to the launch of varied sauces like Chunky, Spicy, and Extra Smooth, which, in turn, led to Prego's sales skyrocketing.

In the new article ( https://buff.ly/3wND6Fv ) published just a few days ago, customer satisfaction researchers identified the drivers of satisfaction in airline travel (the specific drivers they uncovered isn’t really the point of this post, but you really want to know what they were, right? OK:

•	Inflight entertainment
•	Seat comfort
•	Online booking
•	Online support)

The primary interest of the researchers was whether machine learning algorithms beat traditional logistic regression in identifying satisfaction drivers (yes! Random Forest for the win!). 

But It’s the secondary finding that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson:

The satisfaction of one segment of customers was most strongly driven by service quality, while another was most strongly driven by amenities.

In my experience, companies often analyze satisfaction feedback across the customer base as a whole. But that approach often averages out distinct segments in a way that ends up reflecting no one!

If you have open-ended customer feedback and want to identify your customers’ satisfaction drivers, give me a call. I can help. If you don’t collect open-ended customer feedback, give me a call, I can help!  👉 carstendhohnke.com
