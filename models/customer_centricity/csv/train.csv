"We understand the difficulty that some communities face when it comes to accessing information about #energyefficiency and getting the support they need to implement changes. That is why we have launched Round 2 of the Community Partnership Initiative, which is helping to provide more opportunities for residents and businesses to access our programs and lower their energy bills.
 
With Eversource Energy awarding the majority of the grants for Round 2 funding of the Partnership, we are extremely proud of our community partners and project teams for driving deeper engagement with Energize Connecticut programs for disadvantaged customers. As I share in a recent interview with The Hartford Courant, Round 2 specifically targeted #environmentaljustice communities to ensure that they are included in our larger efforts towards #decarbonization, and our project teams are currently working toward a 10 percent increase in enrollment with the programs they have chosen to promote.

"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"An investor once asked me what are the main reasons a bank decides to buy a new core banking system to transformis new features, lower cost, or greater agilityMy response surprised him - clearly a lot. Banks only buy a core banking system when they have absolutely no alternative. Buying a new core for a transformation is like having a heart transplant. You simply don't do it unless you're going to die otherwise. No one goes down the shops and peruses the latest models of  hearts' because they fancy the latest model, or want to run a marathon a couple minutes faster. We need to be honest and acknowledge that some purchases are not driven by benefit, but by necessity. In those cases sales and marketing can't create need, they can only service it and prove their solution superior when it arises. Only when we truly accept the reason behind why people buy things, can we serve that need effectively and generate positive outcomes.Agree?",Customer Centricity

"Since our founding in 2012, the security of our customers data has been our highest priority. Thats why the recent cyber security threat targeting some of our customers has been unsettling, especially given that we, and cybersecurity experts Mandiant (part of Google Cloud) and CrowdStrike, have found no evidence to suggest that unauthorized access to Snowflake customer accounts stemmed from a breach of Snowflake's enterprise environment.

Mandiant released their investigative report on the threat on June 10th confirming our preliminary findings that we had begun sharing with our customers on May 24th.

Key Mandiant findings include:

 Every incident Mandiant responded to associated with this campaign was traced back to compromised customer credentials.
 The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password.
 Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated.
 The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations.

We operate under a shared responsibility security model with our customers  with them having the responsibility to follow best practices when configuring networks and enforcing secure authentication methods for access to their systems  and now we plan to strengthen this model by requiring more stringent protections.

In the coming weeks, we will be providing a feature for administrators of Snowflake accounts to make multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for all users; ultimately moving to MFA by default. While we target to roll out the enhanced authentication policies by the end of June, we are going to do this in a controlled and staged way alongside close communication and enablement. By doing so, well not only be helping our customers better protect themselves, but well also be leading the industry to what we believe will become an industry standard.

We are also accelerating in-product capabilities, such as our Trust Center. This new active audit and monitoring capability is expected to be generally available by the end of June, with additional transparency specifically around MFA and network policies.

This is in addition to other actions weve already taken, like locking customer accounts where we saw cyber threat activity, working closely with affected customers to help them better protect themselves, and communicating with all of our customers to harden their security measures.

You have our commitment that the security of your data will always be our highest priority.",Customer Centricity

"A new research article just came out that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson. Do you know it?

A market researcher trained in psychometrics was hired in the 80s by Campbell Soup. His task was to help identify the perfect flavor for Prego brand spaghetti sauce (which was getting beat in the market by Ragu). 

Instead of a single, better-than-Ragu sauce, the researcher identified distinct clusters of customer preferences. His results led to the launch of varied sauces like Chunky, Spicy, and Extra Smooth, which, in turn, led to Prego's sales skyrocketing.

In the new article ( https://buff.ly/3wND6Fv ) published just a few days ago, customer satisfaction researchers identified the drivers of satisfaction in airline travel (the specific drivers they uncovered isnt really the point of this post, but you really want to know what they were, right? OK:

	Inflight entertainment
	Seat comfort
	Online booking
	Online support)

The primary interest of the researchers was whether machine learning algorithms beat traditional logistic regression in identifying satisfaction drivers (yes! Random Forest for the win!). 

But Its the secondary finding that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson:

The satisfaction of one segment of customers was most strongly driven by service quality, while another was most strongly driven by amenities.

In my experience, companies often analyze satisfaction feedback across the customer base as a whole. But that approach often averages out distinct segments in a way that ends up reflecting no one!

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

As we've broken out of our initial customer base and started to serve these great companies, we've found the need to becoming a filtering engine show each member of the Sales team 5-10 real-time alerts that are relevant to them.This boils down to a few things.ICP Fit. Is this company a company that looks like other companies who have bought from us? The simple metric that most people start with is # of employees, but it turns out that there's lots of other enrichment data that tends to be valuable. Things like:- Overall tech stack: does this company tend to build internally vs. buy?- Specific tech they are using- ARR- Capital raised- Site traffic- Location of HQTypically, we can find 25% of traffic that accounts for 75-80% of conversions.

At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible.

By applying design thinking methodologies, such as empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration, organizations can develop data-driven solutions that truly resonate with users and deliver value.3. Focus on 10% of your data that has 90% of the value. When breaking down business problems into desired outcomes and KPI's, you will start to notice the same KPI's coming up over and over again. Focus on those KPI's.4. AI initiatives need to start small and address a real business problem. 5. Let your voice be heard as the world of AI evolves. It's not too late to affect change. Write to legislators. Stay educated. Highly recommend Bill's books especially "" The Economics of Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation'. He is also a very charismatic and energetic speaker who loves Caribou coffee! hashtag#DataEconomics hashtag#Innovation hashtag#valuedriven hashtag#BillSchmarzo hashtag#designthinking",Customer Centricity

"Incumbents are vulnerable.Lots of folks shy away from markets with strong incumbents and prefer to look for whitespace. Mike Maples, Jr is not one of those people. He loves backing outsiders who spot a new path.The key to taking down an incumbent is to force a choice, not a comparison.People don't want something incrementally better. They don't switch because of a comparison, but because they see something radically different.Think about orthogonal asymmetric attacks  disorient the incumbents, do the opposite of convention, both in the what (the product) and the how (the business model).Business is always a fight. The fight tilts in favor of the startup when it takes the competitive initiative to rewrite the rules of what customers can expect.Mike leverages the sword and the shield mental model from Clayton Christensen when working with startups going up against incumbents.Shield: Your go-to-market strategy is so different, the customer context you're targeting is so different, that the incumbent doesn't feel the incentive to attack you. This is the shield that gives you time to perfect the technology.Sword: Your sword is then the skills you build with this time that the incumbent lacks. By the time the incumbent realizes you're a threat, your skills are too asymmetric.One key aspect in the early days, especially in markets with incumbents, is not to waste time with customers who don't value your advantage. They'll ask you for requirements that don't matter for creating a different future because they're conventional thinkers in the present.Many founders are so desperate to show growth that they will take on any customer. Mike instead advises founders to instead select your customers, don't let them pick you. He'd rather founders go slow to find the desperate customers. Once you've got them, you don't have to throw money at the problem of growth  you only have to syndicate the truth.Real growth is the accelerated accumulation of attractive customers desperate for your advantage.Next up: Mike's perspective on building early stage teams.

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"Heres what a product vision is not:

A succinct, bold, 1-2 sentence statement that describes the change your company wants to make in the world.

Thats a company vision, not a product vision.

A product vision, on the other hand, is a ""detailed enough"" description of the actual solution you intend to build, over time, in order to realize the company vision. 

Here are some examples of great company visions: 
- Stripe: Increase the GDP of the internet
- Google: Provide access to the worlds information in one click
- LinkedIn: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce 

Hopefully, its clear that none of these provide any meaningful product vision or direction.

For example, Google's product people could have pursued the company vision by building a universally accessible, multimedia encyclopedia. That would have been one product vision (anyone remember Microsoft Encarta?).

Or, they could have envisioned a better search engine and gotten to work on that. 

Product visions can take many formats, from a simple written story that describes a customers experience with the future product, to a visiontype comprised of (often annotated) mock-ups of the key elements of the product.

All good product visions, regardless of the format are:
- inspiring
- customer-centric
- successful at bringing the solution to life, at least in broad strokes. 

Speaking of broad strokes  good product visions are clear without being overly prescriptive. They are directive enough to provide a solid north star for the product team(s) to work towards, while challenging those teams to figure out the details over time.

Does your company have a true product vision, or are you under the illusion that your company vision is enough?",Customer Centricity

By applying design thinking methodologies, such as empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration, organizations can develop data-driven solutions that truly resonate with users and deliver value.3. Focus on 10% of your data that has 90% of the value. When breaking down business problems into desired outcomes and KPI's, you will start to notice the same KPI's coming up over and over again. Focus on those KPI's.4. AI initiatives need to start small and address a real business problem. 5. Let your voice be heard as the world of AI evolves. It's not too late to affect change.

"sY    z Y  s  sz- z z z   s zzz2- z sz zz Y1""(...) it's about the hashtag#mindset"" Is the phrase that stuck in my head after a conversation with a good friend about dependencies between teams. It made me reflect and I took one step back to embark in a journey which made me think...   zWhen an organization bets for a tech-first approach, the question shifts from ""how can this hashtag#technology solve a user problem?"" to ""how can we use this technology, regardless of any user problem?"" And the anxiety to hunt problems which could fit the technology starts.   szWith a tech-first approach an organization, obviously, is not going to start aligning teams around user-segments but around tech. What does it happen when ""Agile"" starts kicking-in? Teams slice ""epics"" into user-stories but something we don't notice (maybe nobody does) is that we are also slicing the user-journey and so slicing the end-to-end hashtag#value stream to a ""maybe"" or even no-value stream. This is when pointless conversations about dependencies start, feeling that we are solving a big problem for our users when what we are really doing is entering in a maze with no way out.Z s3s s zsAgile, in its core principles, aims to minimize, not manage, dependencies, so, why do Agile teams find themselves managing dependencies without really knowing how they ended up there? The answer lies not in the methodology itself, but in the organizational inertia. Organizations, slaves of their medieval service organization models, struggle to make the shift towards user-centricity, however, none of them lack terms such as ""Tribe lead"" or ""MVP"", I mean, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.s  z sUnfortunately this is not an exception but rather the rule and I understand that organizations want to change but don't really know where to dig, well, here is a simple Roadmap to get started:"" Know your users!!!: simple but we still don't get it. Talk with your users and segment them into specific needs and challenges"" Getting organized around what we want to achieve. Form teams representing the entire end-to-end value stream, not just technology silos. Believe it or not, most of the times, users are not excited about the technology but about seeing their problems solved"" Effectiveness over efficiency.

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. It's easier than ever to build. (I'm currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning "" if I can do it, you can, too.)I'm excited to share with you what's next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"When we designed the Jefferson Health Honickman Center, our new state-of-the-art outpatient care center, we knew we wanted to create much more than a traditional healthcare facility. We hoped to foster a true sense of #community, so we created an adjoining public plaza that could be activated for special events, fitness classes, and more. 
 
This week, at Jefferson Plaza, we hosted the #Jefferson200 Block Party in partnership with the citys annual Wawa, Inc. Welcome America festival. It was a celebration of #innovation and #education as we recognized Jeffersons rich 200-year legacy and commitment to Greater #Philadelphia. Live music, a DJ, free food, giveaways, #health resources, and a cornhole tournament for Jefferson staff, were some of the highlights. We even had an incredible performance by Phillys own Kathy Sledge, a founding member of the iconic group Sister Sledge. 
 
The most meaningful part of the day was that our team kicked off the party with a service project to make 500 sandwiches for Our Brothers Place shelter. Volunteerism has been a key part of our #bicentennial celebration as weve committed to at least 200,000 hours of service in honor of 200 years. Were half way toward that goal and were just getting started.

While parents who have lost a child to a physical illness openly talk about it, when a parent loses a child to suicide, it is spoken about in hushed tones.What is the difference between losing a child to a physical illness compared to a mental illness? How it is spoken about! But why? They are both illnesses. When I lost my son, Langdon, to suicide, I made a promise to myself and to Langdon that I wouldn't speak in hushed tones.In the last almost 2  12 years since Langdon's death, I have been asked to speak to a friend of a friend or the sibling of a friend who has lost a child to suicide more times than should be allowed.

It makes me think about how we can apply lessons from this stunning environment to the world of customer experience (CX), artificial intelligence (AI), and sustainability.I see AI as a powerful tool, like the sun lighting up these mountains, that can help us understand and cater to our customers better. We can use AI to predict what our customers need before they even know they need it. Like the way these clouds move and change, AI can help us be more adaptable and personalized in our approach.But, with great power comes great responsibility. Every innovation we make with AI needs to be weighed against its impact on our planet. Just as we marvel at the beauty of untouched snow, we need to protect the natural beauty of our world. We must strive for sustainability in everything we do, making sure that our advancements in CX and AI don't come at the cost of our environment.This photo, from the top of the world, is a reminder to me. It tells me that our work with AI and CX should mirror the balance and beauty of nature.

"The world has seen an extraordinary transformation in healthcare delivery, courtesy of the global pandemic. At Elevance Health, we are at the forefront of this change - witnessing a 3% YoY increase in virtual visits, topping 800k in 2023 alone!

Our recent study aimed to gauge consumers' perspectives on virtual healthcare. The results? A whopping 75% of consumers endorse virtual care, planning to continue and recommend these services. They appreciate the accessibility, earning an impressive 90% agreement that virtual care caters to those unable to physically visit a doctor, and 81% acknowledging the improvement in healthcare via integration of virtual care.

Inspired by these insightful findings, Elevance Health keeps evolving with a patient-centric approach, integrating care data, and optimizing virtual health interactions. With rising optimism and growing adoption rates, it's clear that we're only at the initial stage of a virtual care revolution.

"A few years ago, while getting ready for bed on a Thanksgiving night, my father fell and fractured his hip. I drove to meet him in the emergency room, where the young woman at the front desk looked up at me and said, blandly, You must be here to see Room 4. I was actually there to see my dad, but resisted the opportunity to make that a teachable moment and headed to room 4. When I walked in, the nurse was standing with her hand on my dads shoulder. She greeted me warmly and started sharing what a cool guy my father is, that he must be in a lot of pain but has been joking and making her laugh, that hes been telling her about being with the family for Thanksgiving and even about my work in healthcare.

The Glasgow Consensus Statement  published last week and available at https://lnkd.in/ebr7dJXu  focuses on reinforcing the humanity in healthcare.

"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams. Our collaboration with Houston Methodist is one of the largest deployments of generative AI within healthcare today.

"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not Customer Centricity

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

A seamless #SupplyChain is key to our mission to deliver everyday moments of care when people need them most. And there are so many behind-the-scenes links that make up this supply chain. It starts with our trusted suppliers.

Not only did we introduce leaders from key suppliers to Kenvue as a stand-alone company, giving the event an extra-special energy, but around every corner we found new ways to grow together, including supporting our Healthy Lives Mission. Were leaving that room with a shared vision for the future.
