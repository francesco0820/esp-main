"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams.

"A few years ago, while getting ready for bed on a Thanksgiving night, my father fell and fractured his hip. I drove to meet him in the emergency room, where the young woman at the front desk looked up at me and said, blandly, You must be here to see Room 4. I was actually there to see my dad, but resisted the opportunity to make that a teachable moment and headed to room 4. When I walked in, the nurse was standing with her hand on my dads shoulder. She greeted me warmly and started sharing what a cool guy my father is, that he must be in a lot of pain but has been joking and making her laugh, that hes been telling her about being with the family for Thanksgiving and even about my work in healthcare.

The Glasgow Consensus Statement  published last week and available at https://lnkd.in/ebr7dJXu  focuses on reinforcing the humanity in healthcare.

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"sY    z Y  s  sz- z z z   s zzz2- z sz zz Y1""(...) it's about the hashtag#mindset"" Is the phrase that stuck in my head after a conversation with a good friend about dependencies between teams. It made me reflect and I took one step back to embark in a journey which made me think...   zWhen an organization bets for a tech-first approach, the question shifts from ""how can this hashtag#technology solve a user problem?"" to ""how can we use this technology, regardless of any user problem?"" And the anxiety to hunt problems which could fit the technology starts.   szWith a tech-first approach an organization, obviously, is not going to start aligning teams around user-segments but around tech. What does it happen when ""Agile"" starts kicking-in? Teams slice ""epics"" into user-stories but something we don't notice (maybe nobody does) is that we are also slicing the user-journey and so slicing the end-to-end hashtag#value stream to a ""maybe"" or even no-value stream. This is when pointless conversations about dependencies start, feeling that we are solving a big problem for our users when what we are really doing is entering in a maze with no way out.Z s3s s zsAgile, in its core principles, aims to minimize, not manage, dependencies, so, why do Agile teams find themselves managing dependencies without really knowing how they ended up there? The answer lies not in the methodology itself, but in the organizational inertia. Organizations, slaves of their medieval service organization models, struggle to make the shift towards user-centricity, however, none of them lack terms such as ""Tribe lead"" or ""MVP"", I mean, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.s  z sUnfortunately this is not an exception but rather the rule and I understand that organizations want to change but don't really know where to dig, well, here is a simple Roadmap to get started:"" Know your users!!!: simple but we still don't get it. Talk with your users and segment them into specific needs and challenges"" Getting organized around what we want to achieve. Form teams representing the entire end-to-end value stream, not just technology silos. Believe it or not, most of the times, users are not excited about the technology but about seeing their problems solved"" Effectiveness over efficiency. Is not about how many <Agile term> did we deliver, but did we solve any problem for our users?""

"I've never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services I've been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you can't access healthcare the way you should, it's terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldn't get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctor's office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised I've decided it's time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. I'm especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI "" especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning "" was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate ""doctor speak,"" to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. It's easier than ever to build. (I'm currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning "" if I can do it, you can, too.)I'm excited to share with you what's next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members.

You simply don't do it unless you're going to die otherwise. No one goes down the shops and peruses the latest models of  hearts' because they fancy the latest model, or want to run a marathon a couple minutes faster.

Plan to discuss how loyalty as part of a digital consumer experience ecosystem doesn't compete with a brand's penetration goals - it can actually be an enabler! #digitalmarketing,Customer Centricity
"If you're not reaching out to prospects within 15 minutes of them showing interest, you're lighting revenue on fire.I hear so many GTM teams complain about buyer intent not driving impact.The problem 90%+ of the time?Speed. Or lack of it.You need to be acting on buyer intent ASAP. Ideally within minutes. It can't be days, it can't be weeks, it can't be months. Because SaaS products are being bought on a moment's notice.Why does speed matter? At the beginning of the evaluation period, buyers make their short list of solutions to research. Miss that window and you've missed your shot to be considered.$1,000+ ACV contracts are often signed in under a week. You need to reach buyers during the consideration phase.To reiterate: you need to be reaching out to buyers within 15 minutes of them showing intent if you want to maximize impact from buyer intent data.",Customer Centricity

"I've come to think of Koala a bit as a filtering engine. Sounds weird, right?For our customers who are smaller startups, every touchpoint is exciting.- Is it a VC checking things out?- Is it a competitor looking at positioning?- Is it a design partner starting to show more interest?- Could it be our first customer checking out pricing?You don't want to filter anything.But scaled companies are different.Scaled companies typically have hundreds of thousands of ""intent events"" per month.Some have tens of millions per month. As we've broken out of our initial customer base and started to serve these great companies, we've found the need to becoming a filtering engine show each member of the Sales team 5-10 real-time alerts that are relevant to them.This boils down to a few things.ICP Fit. Is this company a company that looks like other companies who have bought from us? The simple metric that most people start with is # of employees, but it turns out that there's lots of other enrichment data that tends to be valuable. Things like:- Overall tech stack: does this company tend to build internally vs. buy?- Specific tech they are using- ARR- Capital raised- Site traffic- Location of HQTypically, we can find 25% of traffic that accounts for 75-80% of conversions. This is your 'A' fit  the stuff that should be going to Sales.Bottom of funnel content. Nagging someone as they first start exploring the tool leaves a bad impression we see best results for Sales teams who are patient. Wait until your buyer is really in the consideration/purchase stage of the journey, starting to consume that content or maybe even kick the tires on the product.

"It was 7 years back, when we were sitting in a meeting room at Lenskart.com office in Okhla Delhi, debating if we should invest in increasing delivery speed beyond 5-7 days. There were mixed thoughts in the room. Few suggested we should benchmark US companies. The team came back with the finding that most global companies are committing 7 days delivery time. Another suggestion was to run a consumer survey to know what % of people want glasses urgently - less than 10% wanted glasses urgently. And as always we ran an A/B test to see increase in revenue, csat.At lenskart, we have had a  fundamental belief from the early days that 'good is not good enough'..i.e. what is good for customers today will not be good tomorrow, as everyone wants to raise their quality of life with time. It is not a question of satisfaction but delight!Long story short, after a lot of analysis and paralysis, none of which clearly suggested investing in faster delivery, we went with our philosophy and took a goal of 3 days delivery...In 2022 we launched 3 days delivery in 8 cities. We kept looking for revenue impact, but we could not find a huge difference. We went against data and decided to take it to the next level, by launching this across 55 cities with a promise of 3 or Free....if you don't get your glasses in 3 days, we will give 50% cash back. While we still could not correlate this to sales growth, we saw that our customer support centre had a huge call increase with queries on 3 or Free... I was finally delighted that customers are talking about this...It is these queues that have always mattered to us more than revenue :)Last year, I already started seeding  the idea of Next-Day delivery in the FY24 Vision Document. The initial reaction of the team was that this is not possible and few rightfully questioned the ROI. Just like last time, we again ran some analysis, but this time the mandate was clear, we need to do it...because remember...good is not good enough :)Finally, we launched Next Day delivery in 4 cities this March 24 (yay)...an incredible work by LensKart Team ...you can order prescription glasses up to 9 pm, and we deliver next day. What looked impossible, especially in a model like ours, where every glass is custom manufactured & shipped from a central factory, became possible and that too profitably without raising cost/ order. And since the last few weeks, I get 100s of messages every day from delighted customers ...a great queue :)In Jan, teams started talking about 10 min delivery. And last week we launched #hustlr on 10 min delivery on Blinkit with support of Albinder Dhindsa & we created a special series for cricket fans to support their team..you must try..these #hustlr are just awesome   & blinkit 10m is  2 Our quality of lives are improving and I believe Indian companies are defining the new standards of customer delight for the globe #domorebemore#makeinindiap.s most eyewear companies globally still commit 7 day delivery",Customer Centricity
"Incumbents are vulnerable.Lots of folks shy away from markets with strong incumbents and prefer to look for whitespace. Mike Maples, Jr is not one of those people. He loves backing outsiders who spot a new path.The key to taking down an incumbent is to force a choice, not a comparison.People don't want something incrementally better. They don't switch because of a comparison, but because they see something radically different.Think about orthogonal asymmetric attacks  disorient the incumbents, do the opposite of convention, both in the what (the product) and the how (the business model).Business is always a fight. The fight tilts in favor of the startup when it takes the competitive initiative to rewrite the rules of what customers can expect.Mike leverages the sword and the shield mental model from Clayton Christensen when working with startups going up against incumbents.Shield: Your go-to-market strategy is so different, the customer context you're targeting is so different, that the incumbent doesn't feel the incentive to attack you. This is the shield that gives you time to perfect the technology.Sword: Your sword is then the skills you build with this time that the incumbent lacks. By the time the incumbent realizes you're a threat, your skills are too asymmetric.One key aspect in the early days, especially in markets with incumbents, is not to waste time with customers who don't value your advantage. They'll ask you for requirements that don't matter for creating a different future because they're conventional thinkers in the present.Many founders are so desperate to show growth that they will take on any customer. Mike instead advises founders to instead select your customers, don't let them pick you. He'd rather founders go slow to find the desperate customers. Once you've got them, you don't have to throw money at the problem of growth  you only have to syndicate the truth.Real growth is the accelerated accumulation of attractive customers desperate for your advantage.Next up: Mike's perspective on building early stage teams.

"Heres what a product vision is not:

A succinct, bold, 1-2 sentence statement that describes the change your company wants to make in the world.

Thats a company vision, not a product vision.

A product vision, on the other hand, is a ""detailed enough"" description of the actual solution you intend to build, over time, in order to realize the company vision. 

Here are some examples of great company visions: 
- Stripe: Increase the GDP of the internet
- Google: Provide access to the worlds information in one click
- LinkedIn: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce 

Hopefully, its clear that none of these provide any meaningful product vision or direction.

For example, Google's product people could have pursued the company vision by building a universally accessible, multimedia encyclopedia. That would have been one product vision (anyone remember Microsoft Encarta?).

Or, they could have envisioned a better search engine and gotten to work on that. 

Product visions can take many formats, from a simple written story that describes a customers experience with the future product, to a visiontype comprised of (often annotated) mock-ups of the key elements of the product.

All good product visions, regardless of the format are:
- inspiring
- customer-centric
- successful at bringing the solution to life, at least in broad strokes. 

Speaking of broad strokes  good product visions are clear without being overly prescriptive. They are directive enough to provide a solid north star for the product team(s) to work towards, while challenging those teams to figure out the details over time.

Does your company have a true product vision, or are you under the illusion that your company vision is enough?",Customer Centricity

"A new research article just came out that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson. Do you know it?

A market researcher trained in psychometrics was hired in the 80s by Campbell Soup. His task was to help identify the perfect flavor for Prego brand spaghetti sauce (which was getting beat in the market by Ragu). 

Instead of a single, better-than-Ragu sauce, the researcher identified distinct clusters of customer preferences. His results led to the launch of varied sauces like Chunky, Spicy, and Extra Smooth, which, in turn, led to Prego's sales skyrocketing.

In the new article ( https://buff.ly/3wND6Fv ) published just a few days ago, customer satisfaction researchers identified the drivers of satisfaction in airline travel (the specific drivers they uncovered isnt really the point of this post, but you really want to know what they were, right? OK:

	Inflight entertainment
	Seat comfort
	Online booking
	Online support)

The primary interest of the researchers was whether machine learning algorithms beat traditional logistic regression in identifying satisfaction drivers (yes! Random Forest for the win!). 

But Its the secondary finding that reminded me of the spaghetti sauce lesson:

The satisfaction of one segment of customers was most strongly driven by service quality, while another was most strongly driven by amenities.

In my experience, companies often analyze satisfaction feedback across the customer base as a whole. But that approach often averages out distinct segments in a way that ends up reflecting no one!
