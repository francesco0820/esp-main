"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not Customer Centricity
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.

"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not Customer Centricity

"There is a special club that no parent ever wants to join""the one where you have lost a child. There is an even smaller club for parents who have lost a child to suicide. While parents who have lost a child to a physical illness openly talk about it, when a parent loses a child to suicide, it is spoken about in hushed tones.What is the difference between losing a child to a physical illness compared to a mental illness? How it is spoken about! But why? They are both illnesses. When I lost my son, Langdon, to suicide, I made a promise to myself and to Langdon that I wouldn't speak in hushed tones.In the last almost 2  12 years since Langdon's death, I have been asked to speak to a friend of a friend or the sibling of a friend who has lost a child to suicide more times than should be allowed. Because of this and because of Langdon, I have changed the direction of my life to helping those who suffer from mental health issues or those who care for them.Why am I posting this today? Today is Langdon's 23rd birthday, and I know he would not want someone to have to talk in hushed tones or feel alone. I don't know who said this, but there are many Suicide loss survivors who need to hear this.

"Ys Achieved Amazon Ads Retail Certification! YsE-commerce and retail media, in particular, have grown incredibly over the past couple of years. At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible. I loved diving deep into the Amazon Ads Retail Certification course where I learned about retail readiness, Amazon's fulfillment solutions, the different aspects of selling on Amazon.com, how to launch a new product on Amazon.com, as well as, navigating Seller Central and Vendor Central. I highly recommend this course for anyone in advertising and marketing who wants to understand e-commerce operations and advertising campaigns.
