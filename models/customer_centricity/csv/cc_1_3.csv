"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.Â For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,Â that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, Iâ€™ll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams. Our collaboration with Houston Methodist is one of the largest deployments of generative AI within healthcare today.

Resources offering real-time, actionable feedback can bring significant value and encourage healthier lifestyle decisions, especially when integrated with a comprehensive care plan. ðŸ¤ Strategic collaborations. Cultivating new relationships can help drive innovation and bring together novel approaches, offering an opportunity to scale solutions to maximize impact. One example is the UnitedHealthcare Accelerator, which helps early startups grow and facilitates a pathway for commercialization. These approaches are driven by data and present a unique opportunity for us to make health care more equitable and affordable.

I drove to meet him in the emergency room, where the young woman at the front desk looked up at me and said, blandly, “You must be here to see Room 4.” I was actually there to see my dad, but resisted the opportunity to make that a teachable moment and headed to room 4. When I walked in, the nurse was standing with her hand on my dad’s shoulder. She greeted me warmly and started sharing “what a cool guy” my father is, that he must be in a lot of pain but has been joking and making her laugh, that he’s been telling her about being with the family for Thanksgiving and even about my work in healthcare.

The Glasgow Consensus Statement – published last week and available at https://lnkd.in/ebr7dJXu – focuses on reinforcing the humanity in healthcare. The primary overarching task is to Connect as Humans. That’s the difference between ‘room 4’ and ‘what a cool guy’. Human connection is essential, not extra. And it benefits patients, families, and health professionals – I hope we can all rally around that.","Customer centricity,Human-centered design",checked

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"Iâ€™ve never seen a service as beloved as GoodRx. In the more than 50 products and services Iâ€™ve been part of in my career, many were impactful on the lives of people who used them for communication, relationships, and connection. But not like GoodRx.Healthcare can be a life-or-death matter. When you canâ€™t access healthcare the way you should, itâ€™s terrifying, frustrating and exhausting. That was true for my own stepmother, who couldnâ€™t get affordable access to insulin due to a blip in Medicare. Thankfully, GoodRx opened up options.Whenever I talked with customers at the doctorâ€™s office, at social events, or even in an Uber, people were so grateful for GoodRx. Millions of people every month use GoodRx, saving them more than $70 billion so far.So with all the customer love and opportunity, you might be surprised Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s time for my next play. Our team accomplished so much together: * We built innovative products that solve real problems. We deployed the first phases of our AI/ML products that help people get what they needed faster and at better prices. We built new medication management solutions that significantly increased patient adherence, one of the biggest problems in healthcare. * We made GoodRx more useful and engaging for its community. We materially changed consumer engagement in a short period of time, showing up in everything from monthly active users, revenue per returning users and retention. People now use GoodRx for more than just discounts.* We changed the way a healthtech company can work. We dramatically increased our velocity, improved our experience, and overhauled our overall product, design and tech culture. Working cross-functionally with shared goals, our teams delivered great results and innovative ideas came from everyone. Iâ€™m especially proud of the diverse leadership bench we built (now, majority led by women) to better represent the community we serve.During my time at both Meta and at GoodRx, it was clear to see how quickly AI â€“ especially NLP, generative AI and machine-learning â€“ was transforming everything. It was exciting to see some of the same playbooks in ML that I learned at Facebook worked just as well with personalization at GoodRx. And how much faster it was to set up those systems that Facebook spent years developing.There is so much new opportunity emerging right now: From generating dynamic content for entertainment companies, to building healthcare agents that translate â€œdoctor speak,â€ to training weed-killing lasers on tractors, to transforming even the hated performance review process. Itâ€™s easier than ever to build. (Iâ€™m currently training a prediction engine that extracts content from emails for personalized travel planning â€“ if I can do it, you can, too.)Iâ€™m excited to share with you whatâ€™s next very soon (sorry, this is a cliffhanger post!).

"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
📈 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
🖥 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies.

The call center often marks the beginning of a patient's healthcare journey, and it is frustrating and time consuming. Today, If you call your doctorâ€™s office and hear the recording sayâ€”â€˜You are theâ€¦sixthâ€¦caller. Your wait time isâ€¦31 minutesâ€™ â€“ youâ€™re bound to hang up and give up getting help.The Assort Health team is committed to solving this problem.  We're on a mission to ensure healthcare is accessible for everyone, everywhere, at any time, and are using the latest advances in AI to solve this pressing issue.Assort Health is revolutionizing the way large healthcare organizations handle patient communication. By leveraging Voice AI to take over routine call tasks, we've managed to slash call drop rates by more than two times and halve waiting times within just 30 days with our partners.I'm honored to work alongside some of the brightest minds in the field. Our platform is at the forefront of care navigation technology, powered by an advanced framework that drives ChatGPT's voice interactions. This is an inevitable shift over the next 5 years, and we will be leading that charge.And yes, we're hiring! Thank you to everyone who has supported us along this journey so far.

"Up here, looking down from the peak of Aiguille Rouge at 3226 meters, it's hard not to be inspired. The mix of snow, sun, and clouds paints a picture of what balance looks like. It makes me think about how we can apply lessons from this stunning environment to the world of customer experience (CX), artificial intelligence (AI), and sustainability.I see AI as a powerful tool, like the sun lighting up these mountains, that can help us understand and cater to our customers better. We can use AI to predict what our customers need before they even know they need it. Like the way these clouds move and change, AI can help us be more adaptable and personalized in our approach.But, with great power comes great responsibility. Every innovation we make with AI needs to be weighed against its impact on our planet. Just as we marvel at the beauty of untouched snow, we need to protect the natural beauty of our world. We must strive for sustainability in everything we do, making sure that our advancements in CX and AI don't come at the cost of our environment.This photo, from the top of the world, is a reminder to me. It tells me that our work with AI and CX should mirror the balance and beauty of nature. It's a call to action to innovate responsibly, ensuring our technologies not only serve our customers but also protect our planet.Let's use AI and CX to create a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony, inspired by the breathtaking vistas like this one.hashtag#AI hashtag#CustomerExperience hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#Nature hashtag#Innovation","AI/Machine Learning,Customer centricity,User Experience",
