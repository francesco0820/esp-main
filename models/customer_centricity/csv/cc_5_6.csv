Thanks to the efforts of over 2,000 team members and our partners at Epic, we're transforming the experience across our medical group, affiliated practices, clinics, pharmacies, and employer solutions with a transformed experience that will help improve the care we deliver to our patients.

This extensive, two-year journey has touched nearly every part of our organization, marking one of the most significant transformations in my career. I'm eager to see the positive changes as we settle into operational efficiency and our patients engage with new digital experiences.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesnewsom/,"Since our founding in 2012, the security of our customers’ data has been our highest priority. That’s why the recent cyber security threat targeting some of our customers has been unsettling, especially given that we, and cybersecurity experts Mandiant (part of Google Cloud) and CrowdStrike, have found no evidence to suggest that unauthorized access to Snowflake customer accounts stemmed from a breach of Snowflake's enterprise environment.

Mandiant released their investigative report on the threat on June 10th confirming our preliminary findings that we had begun sharing with our customers on May 24th.

Key Mandiant findings include:

▪ Every incident Mandiant responded to associated with this campaign was traced back to compromised customer credentials.
▪ The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password.
▪ Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated.
▪ The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations.

We operate under a shared responsibility security model with our customers – with them having the responsibility to follow best practices when configuring networks and enforcing secure authentication methods for access to their systems – and now we plan to strengthen this model by requiring more stringent protections.

In the coming weeks, we will be providing a feature for administrators of Snowflake accounts to make multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for all users; ultimately moving to MFA by default. While we target to roll out the enhanced authentication policies by the end of June, we are going to do this in a controlled and staged way alongside close communication and enablement. By doing so, we’ll not only be helping our customers better protect themselves, but we’ll also be leading the industry to what we believe will become an industry standard.

We are also accelerating in-product capabilities, such as our Trust Center. This new active audit and monitoring capability is expected to be generally available by the end of June, with additional transparency specifically around MFA and network policies.

This is in addition to other actions we’ve already taken, like locking customer accounts where we saw cyber threat activity, working closely with affected customers to help them better protect themselves, and communicating with all of our customers to harden their security measures.

A huge THANK You to the cross UnitedHealth Group teams and leaders who came together to make this happen!

The two-day event was full of insights and learnings. Here are some of the highlights:
🧡 Rita Khan and I jointly shared the need for a unified consumer digital strategy, essential digital capabilities, and the value of data-driven insights.
🧡 Sandeep Dadlani shared valuable advice on how to avoid pitfalls that hinder a culture of fast innovation and growth at scale.
🧡 Professor Peter Fader led discussions on customer lifetime value and its power in creating the most important experiences for our members and patients
🧡 Katie Schumacher and Jared Carr led a session to identify solutions for key consumer pain points, and shared their “why” .
🧡 Chris Hanson turned product development into a fun, agile-building exercise with Lego models (who would have thought?)
🧡 Terry Clark showed us why it matters to advocate for solutions that meet individual healthcare needs.
🧡 Robbi Thatcher moderated a panel that brought insight from consumer advocates, who inspired all of us to be closer to our customers.
🧡 And finally, we engaged in a “design jam” with Anna Stoesz, Cindy Tam, and Bridget Feickert to learn more about rapid prototyping, the role of research, and top UX trends that emphasize iteration to support a continuous experience evolution.

A heartfelt thank you 🙏 to everyone involved in organizing ConsumerCon.!!

I had the opportunity to join Times Radio's Chloe Tilley on the main stage to delve into the key aspects of improving integrated care, affordability, and access through innovation, technology, and collaborative efforts across the health care ecosystem.

I am excited for what Day Two of HLTH Europe holds! Can I sneak my cardboard cutout home with me? 😉

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-anderson/,"When we designed the Jefferson Health Honickman Center, our new state-of-the-art outpatient care center, we knew we wanted to create much more than a traditional healthcare facility. We hoped to foster a true sense of #community, so we created an adjoining public plaza that could be activated for special events, fitness classes, and more. 
 
This week, at Jefferson Plaza, we hosted the #Jefferson200 Block Party in partnership with the city’s annual Wawa, Inc. Welcome America festival. It was a celebration of #innovation and #education as we recognized Jefferson’s rich 200-year legacy and commitment to Greater #Philadelphia. Live music, a DJ, free food, giveaways, #health resources, and a cornhole tournament for Jefferson staff, were some of the highlights. We even had an incredible performance by Philly’s own Kathy Sledge, a founding member of the iconic group Sister Sledge. 
 
The most meaningful part of the day was that our team kicked off the party with a service project to make 500 sandwiches for Our Brother’s Place shelter. Volunteerism has been a key part of our #bicentennial celebration as we’ve committed to at least 200,000 hours of service in honor of 200 years. We’re half way toward that goal and we’re just getting started. 
 
Thanks to all who came out to what I hope is just one of many special moments on #JeffersonPlaza.
