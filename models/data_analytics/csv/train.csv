"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now. 


Grateful, Thankful, and Blessed. ",Not Data and Analytics

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not Data and Analytics
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question. Pierce denial. Pierce lies. Pierce the surface.hashtag#emotionalintelligencehashtag#purposehashtag#iqeqtqThis picture is a fair representation of how I look when I receive compliments. A lot happy.

"The potential for hashtag#AI to transform U.S. hashtag#healthcare has been discussed for over a decade but has yet to deliver the kind of broad-based results the industry desperately needs. I am optimistic that will soon change.  For the last four years, my team at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI) has been hard at work on building a platform, HealthVision,  that uses machine learning and generative AI to give clinicians the information they need to make better clinical decisions. Here are some of my key takeaways from working on making AI usable for clinicians:- Clinical AI can now be deployed at scale: HealthVision is in production at Houston Methodist, fully integrated with Epic, and will eventually be accessible by thousands of clinicians assisting with a wide range of use cases.- Generative AI fills gaps in previous AI technologies: Generative AI can process raw clinical notes to produce structured data that can be ingested by predictive models in near-real time. This enables continuous updating of patient risk profiles as their care progresses.  - AI turns data complexity into actionable simplicity: HealthVision distills hundreds of pages of medical records into ONE PAGE that presents a holistic and prioritized view of patient risks. On October 8th at 3:40pm PT, I'll be presenting with Roberta Schwartz at hashtag#HLTH2023 about putting data-driven insights into the hands of clinicians and care teams.

"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

It was a day of empowerment and heartfelt connections! 
I'm looking forward to what Day 3 has in store.

Wearable devices can provide insights about our health, but the key is knowing what to do with that information. Resources offering real-time, actionable feedback can bring significant value and encourage healthier lifestyle decisions, especially when integrated with a comprehensive care plan. Y Strategic collaborations. Cultivating new relationships can help drive innovation and bring together novel approaches, offering an opportunity to scale solutions to maximize impact. One example is the UnitedHealthcare Accelerator, which helps early startups grow and facilitates a pathway for commercialization.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:Y Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. Y Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. YZ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. Yi  Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) Y Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology",Data and Analytics

"What are 2 2 1   o2 2 s22 14 (s)    2o ?Here is an example of a simple RAG based Chatbot to query your Private Knowledge Base.First step is to store the knowledge of your internal documents in a format that is suitable for querying. We do so by embedding it using an embedding model:Y: Split text corpus of the entire knowledge base into chunks - a chunk will represent a single piece of context available to be queried. Data of interest can be from multiple sources, e.g. Documentation in Confluence supplemented by PDF reports.Y: Use the Embedding Model to transform each of the chunks into a vector embedding.Y : Store all vector embeddings in a Vector Database.Y: Save text that represents each of the embeddings separately together with the pointer to the embedding (we will need this later).Next we can start constructing the answer to a question/query of interest:Y: Embed a question/query you want to ask using the same Embedding Model that was used to embed the knowledge base itself.Y2: Use the resulting Vector Embedding to run a query against the index in the Vector Database. Choose how many vectors you want to retrieve from the Vector Database - it will equal the amount of context you will be retrieving and eventually using for answering the query question.Y3: Vector DB performs an Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search for the provided vector embedding against the index and returns previously chosen amount of context vectors. The procedure returns vectors that are most similar in a given Embedding/Latent space. Y : Map the returned Vector Embeddings to the text chunks that represent them.Y: Pass a question together with the retrieved context text chunks to the LLM via prompt. Instruct the LLM to only use the provided context to answer the given question. This does not mean that no Prompt Engineering will be needed - you will want to ensure that the answers returned by LLM fall into expected boundaries, e.g. if there is no data in the retrieved context that could be used make sure that no made up answer is provided.To make it a real Chatbot - face the entire application with a Web UI that exposes a text input box to act as a chat interface. After running the provided question through steps 1. to 9. - return and display the generated answer. This is how most of the chatbots that are based on a single or multiple internal knowledge base sources are actually built nowadays.There are many caveats you might face while building RAG Systems, I'll cover them in the following weeks.--------Follow me to upskill in hashtag#MLOps, hashtag#MachineLearning, hashtag#DataEngineering, hashtag#DataScience and overall hashtag#Data space.14'  314 2   14 1 2 Y,  2  14oo2 !Join a growing community of Data Professionals by subscribing to my 2  12  2/114 .",Data and Analytics

"I've made that point before:
- LLM: 1E13 tokens x 0.75 word/token x 2 bytes/token = 1E13 bytes.
- 4 year old child: 16k wake hours x 3600 s/hour x 1E6 optical nerve fibers x 2 eyes x 10 bytes/s = 1E15 bytes.

In 4 years, a child has seen 50 times more data than the biggest LLMs.

1E13 tokens is pretty much all the quality text publicly available on the Internet. It would take 170k years for a human to read (8 h/day, 250 word/minute).

Text is simply too low bandwidth and too scarce a modality to learn how the world works.

Video is more redundant, but redundancy is precisely what you need for Self-Supervised Learning to work well.

Incidentally, 16k hours of video is about 30 minutes of YouTube uploads.

"So there's this new tool out there called Motif Analytics. To the extent that I understand it (which, you know, minimally), it's like regex for event data. They created a very specialized language for manipulating and analyzing events, so that you don't have to write some god-awful SQL query full of self-joins and window functions to figure out how often thing X happens after thing Y, without thing Z happening in between. SQL could do this, of course, but the writing a query like that would be long, tedious, and easy to mess up. Motif, by contrast, is precise and compact. If you knew how to use Motif - even if you didn't know it that well and had to frequently look up its syntax when you used it - it would be pretty silly to think, ""eh, forget it, I'll just use SQL instead, the queries are huge and I get them wrong all the time, but at least I don't have ever Google how do to anything."" The thing is, ever since ChatGPT came out, that's basically what we're trying to do to SQL itself? There are tons of companies and products that promise to replace SQL queries with English questions. But, English is to SQL was SQL is to Motif: A more verbose, more tedious, and less precise language that often makes doing a job *harder.* Imagine trying to describe some multi-step SQL query in English - or even just instructing a bot on how to do a join without using the word join. It'd be a nightmare. For fancy analyses, SQL isn't a necessary evil that computers need to understand us; it's a useful virtue that we need to tell computers what we want. So like, yeah, SQL chatbots are cool and all, and I'm sure one day they'll get quite good at writing SQL. But I'm not sure we'll ever want that, not because computers will need SQL to query a database, but because we won't be able to express ourselves in English.",Data and Analytics

It implements a maze traversal algorithm purely from pixels, by literally painting a red line from the beginning position to the end on a maze.Very interesting experiment.

(by Rylan Schaeffer,  Brando Miranda and  Sanmi Koyejo) studies emergent properties of LLMs, and concludes: ""... emergent abilities appear due the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance."" Public perception goes through discontinuities when lots of people suddenly become aware of a technology -- maybe one that's been developing for a long time --  leading to a surprise.

"aRAG demos are easy. RAG in production is much harder. Why is it so?Recently I wrote about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the technique that enables enterprises to leverage the power of large language models (link in comment ).Many companies have experienced that their technology teams are able to demonstrate the use of RAG quite rapidly. However, when the time comes to put the solution into production, they face difficulties. The users do not accept the solution easily and many don't think it adds a lot of value.We will first see why the demos are easy and then reflect on the challenge of productionising RAG.Why are RAG demos easy?Y Simple architecture: The principle of RAG is quite simple to understand. In the basic RAG pipeline, there are very few components: vector database, source chunking, vector matching and LLM interface. It is easy for engineers to understand the architecture.Y Framework availability: To make matters simpler, helper frameworks such as Langchain and LlamaIndex are available. They come with built-in support for chunking, vector databases and LLMs. It is possible to build an RAG pipeline by writing a few lines of code, if you are using one of these frameworks. The initial results of such a pipeline are very impressive, mainly because of the language abilities of the LLMs. Thus great demonstrations can be built quickly with RAG. YYNow we will see why using RAG in production is challenging. Y Correct but not comprehensive: For simpler questions, the replies are often satisfactory. However, when complex questions are asked, the users find the answers correct, but not satisfactory. They feel that the reply covers only basic aspects, but not what they really needed.Y Source requirements: In order that RAG works, the necessary knowledge sources should be added to the vector index. It takes a lot of effort to judge the requirements of users and accordingly build the index. It does not stop here. The index must be forever updated with current information.Y Easy to add, difficult to remove: Once a source is added to the index, it starts influencing the answers. Many times, multiple sources contain conflicting information (for example, old and new price list). The answers in this case become unreliable.Y Data privacy: The quick RAG implementations typically use an external LLM api such as OpenAI or Google. In such cases, the internal data of an organization is sent to the outside world; creating a possibility of data privacy issues.Y Latency: As the index size grows, it takes a long time to select the right material for a query. This is unacceptable for real time use.Overcoming these challenges involves building a more complex pipeline. I will describe that in a later post, but here are some techniques that can help: reranking, knowledge graph, internal models, trust layers.hashtag#llm hashtag#retrievalaugmentedgeneration hashtag#aiinbusiness",Data and Analytics

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members.

"I'm reflecting on my experience at the Analytics Leadership Consortium (ALC) Summit, hosted by the International Institute for Analytics in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic - and here are my key takeaways:

First - CAO Albert Marinez shared that the value in data & analytics at their institution is recognized by leaders beyond his sphere, quoting their CEO Tom, ""Data are the vital signs of the organization."" D&A at the Clinic is viewed as a shared enterprise service; leaders like Albert work hard to engage everyone with their data and assets, recognizing the power it holds for its 81,000 global caregivers/workforce.

Second - while prioritizing speed alone has led some companies into irreversible consequences, the Clinic champions good governance as a means to accelerate AI innovation. (Joseph Dorocak, ASA, MAAA & Kevin Mooney, Esq.) From embedding principles into model development to developing enforceable standards, their deep dive was invaluable.

Third - we covered quite a bit of ground, from implementing ethical AI frameworks and integrating GenAI into existing roadmaps, to quantum computing (that's Jack Phillips & I in front of IBM Quantum System One) and VR training as a means to up-skill on the ""soft stuff"" (read: communication skills) in healthcare. Many questions remain for me, but this is the one that's loudest right now: How does a large, complex organization adhere to varying (EU, USA, etc.) regulatory mandates across its global presence AND accomplish some form of standardization?

TL;DR? This is your reminder to separate the signal from the noise. Cleveland Clinic is a beacon of forward-thinking in healthcare analytics.

 Special thanks to Albert Marinez, Andrew Proctor, Lisa Teti, James Simon MD, MBA, Kevin Mooney, Esq., Randy Geise, and all of the incredible leaders whose contributions made this Summit truly exceptional.

"Many of us in the data science field often lack knowledge of high-performance computing systems. Without this expertise, we can end up spending days or even weeks training a machine learning model. The book I recently read, ""Accelerate Model Training with PyTorch 2.X"" by Maicon Melo Alves, fills that gap, offering insights that can significantly speed up our work.

What I really appreciated was the book's practical, hands-on approach with copious code examples and experimental evaluations.

I appreciate Vinishka Kalra for making time to send me a copy of this book. Thank you!

"Many claim to be data-driven, but most focus solely on revenue, a lagging indicator of past performance. By the time revenue drops, it's too late to take corrective action.

Being truly data-driven means identifying and influencing the inputs to revenue, known as driver metrics or KPIs. The key to making this happen is the Weekly Metrics Review meeting, my favorite and most impactful ritual of the week.

Weekly Metrics Meeting goes over:
(a) All of the driver metrics that lead to revenue,
(b) voiced over by the directly responsible individuals that own them,
(c) on a weekly basis.

Ive seen the transformative effect this ritual has had on my teams at SurveyMonkey, Miro, Amplitude, and now at Dropbox: everyone is on the same page and tracking the same metrics. No more data drift. No more misalignment. No more distrust in data. This one meeting allows the team to focus on executing in the same direction.

-> To get started, begin by identifying the driver metrics. This means building a bottom-up forecast model (i.e. actual math formula) to connect these metrics to output revenue.
These usually include sign ups, free to paid conversion, churn rate, etc.

-> Then, understand which driver metrics need to change/lift to achieve the desired revenue scenario. These become your assumptions.

-> The Weekly Metrics Review meeting focuses only on the driver metrics with assumptions against them.

-> Lastly, identify the people who will own each metric, coordinating activities across departments to drive the desired lift.

-> Go over these metrics with all DRIs on a weekly basis.

Trust me, it's a game changer once you perfect it.

"Forget much of what you thought you knew about what consumers want to see from advertising  

Our new research, launched at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity deep dives into how people across generations & demographics want brands to show up across their brand experience journey. Here are a few highlights:

When consumers are in the discovery phase, production quality of the ad is 2x more important than the product featured, alone.

Mirroring Gen Z's preferences, 52% of Gen Alpha gravitate towards short- form videos between 2-5 minutes. However, longer content isn't entirely out of favor.

In the Mid Funnel Consideration phase, consumers want to see Product, Product, Product. Product information is 2.4x more effective than price and promotion. 

Price and promotions are not in the top five most important creative considerations during the Discovery & Consideration phases of their brand experience journey.

Only at the purchase phase of the brand experience journey, do consumers rate the actual product offer the most important. Product is 1.6x more important than production which is rated #1 in the Discovery phase.

While affordability remains a consideration, product information trumps price promotions when influencing purchase decisions.

People are looking for a journey, not a sales pitch. They want brands to guide them from discovery to consideration to action, with creative messaging that truly resonates.

Read the report and learn what truly matters to today's consumers + what winning creative across the funnel looks like ",Data and Analytics
