https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilbhatt/,"We are incredibly proud to share that our Chief Product & Technology Officer, Gene German, has authored a groundbreaking article featured in Chief Healthcare Executive.

Gene’s article dives deep into the pivotal role of AI and prepayment #claims editing in revolutionizing payment accuracy and creating significant value for health plans.

💡 Key Takeaways:

🔹 AI’s Transformative Power: The integration of AI and predictive analytics is crucial for enhancing payment accuracy and reducing administrative costs.

🔹 Data-Driven Healthcare: As healthcare generates 30% of the world’s data, AI’s potential to harness this data for transformative solutions is immense.

🔹 Addressing Payment Challenges: Innovative AI tools are essential for tackling rising healthcare costs, administrative waste, and fraud.

🔹 Collaborative Innovation: Effective solutions arise from deep industry expertise and genuine partnerships, addressing specific challenges such as state Medicaid compliance and genetic testing claims.

Gene’s perspective underscores a critical shift in healthcare payment integrity towards prepay solutions, enabled by AI. This approach minimizes the need for costly post-payment interventions and fosters better payer-provider relationships.

As we navigate this dynamic landscape, it’s essential for industry leaders to embrace AI-driven solutions that not only improve efficiency but also enhance care quality.

The future of payment integrity will be defined by collaboration, innovation, and the strategic use of advanced technologies.

Last week I had the privilege of hosting a discussion on ""unleashing health data"" at the World Economic Forum's Global Technology Retreat. As we think about harnessing the power of GenAI and LLMs to improve the way we care for people, we identified the need for aligned incentives to drive transformative change; clear statements of sustainable ROI for all stakeholders, including patients and communities; robust public-private partnerships; and high impact case studies to show in practice that we must do more than simply be content with these powerful new tools nibbling around the edges of a broken healthcare system.

I am passionate about creating a better world for our children and grandchildren. What else should we leave behind, if not a flower for someone else to enjoy when we are gone?

Join me this week at the CMS Health Equity Conference to talk about using data and AI to improve health equity. While I am looking forward to presenting and facilitating conversation, I’m most excited about learning from other experts and colleagues on this topic.

To me, improving health equity means increasing the opportunity for someone to attain their optimal health - regardless of things like race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, geography or language.

Sometimes the best next step in creating the future you imagine is to take an objective look at where you are NOW (both as an organization and as an individual!) #HelloData Having a baseline is necessary to effectively measure change over time. How else will you know if you are actually moving in the right direction? How else will you have the confidence to change investments to better serve your mission?

Data can help us celebrate the “wins” - reminding us where we started - highlighting how far we’ve come. Data can also help us to stay grounded in how far we still have to go, so we can continue making the business case to invest in a purposeful pursuit.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-donovan-3229184/,"I'm reflecting on my experience at the Analytics Leadership Consortium (ALC) Summit, hosted by the International Institute for Analytics in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic - and here are my key takeaways:

First - CAO Albert Marinez shared that the value in data & analytics at their institution is recognized by leaders beyond his sphere, quoting their CEO Tom, ""Data are the vital signs of the organization."" D&A at the Clinic is viewed as a shared enterprise service; leaders like Albert work hard to engage everyone with their data and assets, recognizing the power it holds for its 81,000 global caregivers/workforce.

Second - while prioritizing speed alone has led some companies into irreversible consequences, the Clinic champions good governance as a means to accelerate AI innovation. (Joseph Dorocak, ASA, MAAA & Kevin Mooney, Esq.) From embedding principles into model development to developing enforceable standards, their deep dive was invaluable.

Third - we covered quite a bit of ground, from implementing ethical AI frameworks and integrating GenAI into existing roadmaps, to quantum computing (that's Jack Phillips & I in front of IBM Quantum System One) and VR training as a means to up-skill on the ""soft stuff"" (read: communication skills) in healthcare. Many questions remain for me, but this is the one that's loudest right now: How does a large, complex organization adhere to varying (EU, USA, etc.) regulatory mandates across its global presence AND accomplish some form of standardization?

TL;DR? This is your reminder to separate the signal from the noise. Cleveland Clinic is a beacon of forward-thinking in healthcare analytics.

👏 Special thanks to Albert Marinez, Andrew Proctor, Lisa Teti, James Simon MD, MBA, Kevin Mooney, Esq., Randy Geise, and all of the incredible leaders whose contributions made this Summit truly exceptional.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/willruble/,"Many claim to be data-driven, but most focus solely on revenue, a lagging indicator of past performance. By the time revenue drops, it's too late to take corrective action.

Being truly data-driven means identifying and influencing the inputs to revenue, known as driver metrics or KPIs. The key to making this happen is the Weekly Metrics Review meeting, my favorite and most impactful ritual of the week.

Weekly Metrics Meeting goes over:
(a) All of the driver metrics that lead to revenue,
(b) voiced over by the directly responsible individuals that own them,
(c) on a weekly basis.

I’ve seen the transformative effect this ritual has had on my teams at SurveyMonkey, Miro, Amplitude, and now at Dropbox: everyone is on the same page and tracking the same metrics. No more data drift. No more misalignment. No more distrust in data. This one meeting allows the team to focus on executing in the same direction.

-> To get started, begin by identifying the driver metrics. This means building a bottom-up forecast model (i.e. actual math formula) to connect these metrics to output revenue.
These usually include sign ups, free to paid conversion, churn rate, etc.

-> Then, understand which driver metrics need to change/lift to achieve the desired revenue scenario. These become your assumptions.

-> The Weekly Metrics Review meeting focuses only on the driver metrics with assumptions against them.

-> Lastly, identify the people who will own each metric, coordinating activities across departments to drive the desired lift.

-> Go over these metrics with all DRIs on a weekly basis.

Trust me, it's a game changer once you perfect it.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"Forget much of what you thought you knew about what consumers want to see from advertising 🛑 

Our new research, launched at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity deep dives into how people across generations & demographics want brands to show up across their brand experience journey. Here are a few highlights:

•When consumers are in the discovery phase, production quality of the ad is 2x more important than the product featured, alone.

•Mirroring Gen Z's preferences, 52% of Gen Alpha gravitate towards short- form videos between 2-5 minutes. However, longer content isn't entirely out of favor.

•In the Mid Funnel Consideration phase, consumers want to see Product, Product, Product. Product information is 2.4x more effective than price and promotion. 

•Price and promotions are not in the top five most important creative considerations during the Discovery & Consideration phases of their brand experience journey.

•Only at the purchase phase of the brand experience journey, do consumers rate the actual product offer the most important. Product is 1.6x more important than production which is rated #1 in the Discovery phase.

•While affordability remains a consideration, product information trumps price promotions when influencing purchase decisions.

People are looking for a journey, not a sales pitch. They want brands to guide them from discovery to consideration to action, with creative messaging that truly resonates.
