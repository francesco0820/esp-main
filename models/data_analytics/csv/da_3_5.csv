It seems like Ron Shevlin started a sh*t storm. Here's my take Chime are planning a 2025 IPO, according to Bloomberg. With 38m customers, Chime may have more primary users than Bank of America. Ron Shevlin says about half consider Chime to be their primary checking account, which would put them between PayPal and Wells Fargo in market share.My take§  Chime has disrupted the market. An IPO in 2025 would be a crowning moment for them. Their demographic today skews lower income, which is harder to make a profit from, despite their low-cost operating model. The path to profitability is likely via going up market and/or cross-selling.§  Chime will cross-sell successfully, but I'm not sure its brand can go upmarket. Nobody has quite nailed that premium millennial Fintech consumer experience high ground Monzo and Starling took in the UK. The UK digital banks' first cohorts are aging into being high deposit balance customers. Chime's wedge in get paid early and credit building just doesn't feel aspirational. That's not a knock; the market needs what it does desperately. It's just a brand question.§  Primary checking account is such a BS term. Chase defines it as anyone with over $500 monthly deposits plus 5x transactions. But that could also mean it's a paycheck motel. Money comes in and goes out. Primary used to mean the top of the wallet and first in line to cross-sell. Today it just means collecting a good chunk of consumer deposit balances ·™‚¸§  Does Chime ever want to be a bank? When they IPO they'll have that sweet tech company multiple. Banks get valued very differently. But I think the trick is to be a growth stock. You can do that with a balance sheet. It's working for Nubank, it's sort of working for SoFi (which, arguably, it shouldn't), and it will work for Monzo. If I were advising them, I'd stay away from the charter for ~3 to 5 years until they figure out lending, and then buy a charter to improve economics further down the line.You'll find this and much more by heading to sytaylor.substack .com and hitting subscribe#fintech #ipo #neobanks","Transactions 1,Data and Analytics",,"infographic,survey/study/report",,Andrew,Kaplan,Flagstar Bank,Banking,"EVP, Chief Digital & Banking as a Service Officer",150,24,0,1mo,,,,Andrew Kaplan liked Ron Shevlinâ€™s comment on this,Liked a comment,,2024-03-26 17:50,3/26/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,5:50 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,checked,174,Engagement,5pm-6pm,March 2024,

That works out to 8.1% of all American adults (check out the Forbes article below for the breakout by generation).In contrast, Wells Fargo has 8.5% of the market, and Chase”the nation's largest bank (in terms of assets)”counts 7.6% of Americans as primary checking account customers.

Obviously, the prospect of this role and the expectations were exciting, which is why you took it. Then, after you've settled in, you realize there's1. No foundational data infrastructure 2. Massive amounts of tech debt3. Immense resource gaps4. Shadow IT operations5. Siloed departmentsAll these are somewhat expected from an org that has immature data processes, but each extends the timeline for progress and tangible ROI on the platform significantly. Adding to all this, the data leader likely doesn't report directly to the CEO, and their funding is cut because they report to another department with higher priority initiatives.This is a common reality for many data leaders where there's a disconnect between the desired outcomes of leveraging data and the effort, resources, and time needed to build a proper data platform to enable basic and advanced use cases. Scenarios like this are also why data leaders have short tenures (<2 years) between quitting (burnout, lack of support) or getting fired (impatience, lack of perceived ROI).Companies must be prudent in developing their data platform and hiring the right data leader to connect the data to the business. Chasing new shiny objects (AI) or having insane expectations (8-figure cost savings) will cause an endless revolving door of data leadership with little to no progress. #EGDataGuy","Leadership,Data and Analytics",Leadership,post,,Will,Ruble,Diverzify,Consumer & Industrial Products,VP of Business Intelligence | Architecture | CRM,1857,138,76,1mo,,,,Will Ruble likes this,Likes,,2024-03-27 04:37,3/27/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,4:37 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,2071,Engagement,4am-5am,March 2024,

In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market ” now in its third decade ” continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital ” particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.","Digital Transformation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",,document,,Kristin,Nimsger,Thoma Bravo,Private Equity,Operating Partner,944,31,24,3w,,,,Kristin Nimsger Weston likes this,Likes,,2024-04-01 17:07,4/1/2024,Monday,Monday,5:07 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,999,Engagement,5pm-6pm,April 2024,

With 2 custom objects and a flow, you can build your own Round Robin to evenly (or unevenly) distribute any kind of record to your team. Easy to maintain. Easy for users and managers.Quota: This is a big maybe for me on whether or not this should be built in Salesforce. Using the same framework, we have built really cool quota functionality that can quota off of opportunities, opportunity splits, revenue schedules, a custom object, etc. with different levels of quotas. (i.e. an individual quota rolls up to a team quota rolls up to a parent quota rolls up to a company quota). Both of these are really simple builds that will scale with you. So, the question always comes into play: Build or Buy. The answer is 'it depends,' but we have built out some really cool solutions for clients who chose to Build. We make recommendations, keep it simple and focus on user experience. That's where true expertise liesShoot me a note in the comments if you want to learn more about these.

But we don't just hand our team a report. We build our ""data diet"" together - and it looks like this.A few things you'll notice: 1¸£  We take a ""Less Data, More Often"" approach. We pick a few key metrics to report on every week, and then decide together which metrics warrant less frequent review. We try and get the rhythm right - and only include the metrics in our weekly report that we'll actually talk about. 2¸£ We start with questions (not metrics), and we keep the list short. Starting with a list of questions helps ground our reporting in the things our teams are already discussing when we're not there - and allows us to start getting ""exit ready"" by incorporating the questions we know we'll eventually get asked in a diligence process. 3¸£ We clarify the definitions of our metrics and we set targets. We take the extra time to define what each KPI means and how we'll calculate it, and when possible, we set a simple target - even if it's early and we don't quite know what we don't know yet. Structuring your own data diet is a relatively simple exercise - but it's one of the most powerful methods there is to start getting a grip on your business and get yourself out of managing by gut-feel.

My key takeaways from the sessions are that for Managed Care leaders to succeed in their roles, all paths MUST start with data collection - only you understand your business best - not a consultant, not an advisor, not a vendor, and not the payer you're negotiating with. So what does data collection mean and how can you tell the best story of your business to ensure you level the playing field in your negotiations? 

1. Understand your market - how saturated is it? what rates are other ASCs being reimbursed for the same services and for the same payers? what other ASC options are there around you?

2. Communicate your service - what is the quality of care that your physicians are delivering in your ASCs? Leverage case mix-adjusted performance scores to talk to the CMO and their medical directors at health plans to share this information on how you benchmark against other ASCs and/or HOPDs

3. Explain your savings - compare your rates against those of HOPDs apples-to-apples to show where you're saving dollars for your health plan partners!

4. Show the impact of driving more volume - See what procedures and services are being delivered by site of care in your market or markets you're expanding to and assess what additional savings you can drive by shifting more of that.

5. Find opportunity - are there creative ways for you to be framing your asks based on this data? e.g., should you be thinking about asking for a slight uptick on the Medicare rate given how much you are saving by shifting that spend out of the hospital setting? 

Controlling the narrative is so important in conversations and negotiations and meaningful data will empower you to do just that. Clarify Health Solutions empowers all four bullets above. Come talk to us to learn more!

The cohort is equivalent to a graduate level class, but oriented towards spending time immersing themselves in the following areas:

- Data Analysis (for 2 months)
- Data Visualization 
- How to work with Healthcare Data 
- Understanding aspects of Healthcare Operations
- Understanding frameworks and application of Process Improvement

Excited to immerse myself in the industry I love with a well experienced cohort of caregivers, operational leaders and analytics developers. Excited to share thoughts, but more excited to learn from and with these team members. This is one of many steps ahead of us in the development of our enterprise data academy and data fluency education & training programs journey. Finally, shout out to our partners Maddie Banas & Desiree Winters for their dedication to the advancement of this program and impact on our broader care continuum.

Can't wait to share some of our lessons learned, but more excited about another advancement on this pillar of our enterprise data & analytics journey  in coming weeks.

Sounds like a clickbait title, right? But that's exactly what we did. We paused our fastest-growing, most profitable sales channel – Amazon 🛒 – just as we hit UK bestseller status. 

Were we mad? Maybe. But we had a hunch that a lot of the growth from Amazon was taking away from Shopify - which means less data in Meta, higher CPAs and lower confidence in spend. We knew the only thing to do was follow our gut and test the theory. By turning Amazon off and seeing what happened next.

Let me set the scene. Amazon was skyrocketing: week-on-week growth, ROAS through the roof, each purchase profitable.

Meanwhile, our DTC acquisition costs were ballooning, profits sliding. Conventional wisdom says double down on Amazon, right? Well in this case....wrong.

We did the unthinkable and binned Amazon off, gambling on a hunch that it would improve our DTC sales as Amazon customers migrate back to our website, allowing Meta to optimise faster and improve conversion performance overall. 

Heart in mouth, we flipped the switch two Fridays ago.

Day one: Amazon sales nosedived 📉, website sales didn't budge. Was this an expensive mistake?

Day two: website sales ticked up. But just a bit. Hmm. Maybe we were wrong?

Day three: WHOOP! Best sales day in weeks, lowest CPAs since December 
🎉. Our hunch looked like it was paying off.

The past couple of weeks, we immediately saw CPAs lower, CM3 improve, and therefore have been able to increase spend again and restart our prior pace of experimentation.

So, what's next for Amazon? We know there are some sales we're missing out on from not being on there right now and we've not yet decided where we go next on that channel. If you've got thoughts on this, I'd love to hear in the comments.

Moral of the story though: Your P&L only tells half the tale. Trust your instincts and take those risks to uncover the hidden opportunities for growth.

A big shout out to Josh Lachkovic at Ballpoint, Stuart Worgan at eClarity, and Shaun M. for being the best in the business and giving us the confidence to take these big bets.

His latest post got me thinking about the standard deviations across different deal sizes and days as these are the ""sound barrier""

We are bound by the laws of nature, in this case, the speed at which companies can make decisions.

The question is can we bend the laws of nature with changes in our approach? One of the more interesting changes that bends nature is purchase with hyperscaler commitment dollars.

A seasoned lifecycle marketer once told me that the key to unlocking retention can often come from the right acquisition strategy.

When peer-to-peer marketplace Mercari US entered the U.S., they faced stiff competition from giants like eBay and Craigslist. They needed a strategy to attract new users and build a community that encouraged return buyers and sellers. To accomplish that, they partnered with GrowthLoop to leverage #BigQuery and activate their predictive models to drive retention. 

Together, GrowthLoop and Mercari….

👉 Used predictions to identify retention features, and then built out initial segment definitions based on those features. 

👉 From there, the Mercari team used the results to design and launch experiments with GrowthLoop, refining audiences based on performance

👉 Mercari’s marketing team could now build their own customer lists using predictive models without requiring continuous support from other teams. This drove major retention and revenue lift impacts.

📈Focusing on churn with data science, automated activation, and consistent experimentation was the key to unlocking retention.

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry load’s carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now “Tide Cold Certified” – meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well – or even better – in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. It’s a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And we’re proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tide’s ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI.

In some of the most recent AI panels, discussions and summits I have been at women are sorely underrepresented. It was so stark that some of the men at these events even made comments about it. Which I really appreciated because we absolutely need their support with remedying this issue. This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

As a data person, I needed some baseline data!! A survey by Junior Achievement (JA) conducted by the research group Engine shows that only 9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle “nudging”.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease. 

Interested in thoughts on how we can get ahead of this issue before it’s too late. This is a real problem..

We have posted information on how we are doing this, including the AI prompt, and you can share feedback through the form on this page: https://lnkd.in/ezVnvGiG 

While AI will play a role, our human judges will make the final decisions, ensuring a balanced and fair evaluation process. We're committed to learning from this experience and sharing our insights. Please reach out to me if you are interested in helping with the competition in any way.

Research has demonstrated that ""Data-driven initiatives have been shown to help VC firms reduce gender bias and make better, fairer investment decisions"" (https://lnkd.in/ecfqqgj3). Additionally, ""Machine learning models have already been proven to outperform human investors in deal screening"" (https://lnkd.in/exicBiTR), helping to identify high-potential startups more effectively. By incorporating AI into our evaluation process, we aim to support an objective selection of startups.

As a reminder, applications are due on May 26th.
