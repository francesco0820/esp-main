"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now. 


Grateful, Thankful, and Blessed. ",Not Data and Analytics,0

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.

"Chime likely to IPO in 2025 and has more primary bank accounts than chase.  It seems like Ron Shevlin started a sh*t storm. Here's my take Chime are planning a 2025 IPO, according to Bloomberg. With 38m customers, Chime may have more primary users than Bank of America. Ron Shevlin says about half consider Chime to be their primary checking account, which would put them between PayPal and Wells Fargo in market share.My take  Chime has disrupted the market. An IPO in 2025 would be a crowning moment for them. Their demographic today skews lower income, which is harder to make a profit from, despite their low-cost operating model. The path to profitability is likely via going up market and/or cross-selling.  Chime will cross-sell successfully, but I'm not sure its brand can go upmarket. Nobody has quite nailed that premium millennial Fintech consumer experience high ground Monzo and Starling took in the UK. The UK digital banks' first cohorts are aging into being high deposit balance customers. Chime's wedge in get paid early and credit building just doesn't feel aspirational. That's not a knock; the market needs what it does desperately. It's just a brand question.  Primary checking account is such a BS term. Chase defines it as anyone with over $500 monthly deposits plus 5x transactions. But that could also mean it's a paycheck motel. Money comes in and goes out. Primary used to mean the top of the wallet and first in line to cross-sell. Today it just means collecting a good chunk of consumer deposit balances TM   Does Chime ever want to be a bank? When they IPO they'll have that sweet tech company multiple. Banks get valued very differently. But I think the trick is to be a growth stock. You can do that with a balance sheet. It's working for Nubank, it's sort of working for SoFi (which, arguably, it shouldn't), and it will work for Monzo. If I were advising them, I'd stay away from the charter for ~3 to 5 years until they figure out lending, and then buy a charter to improve economics further down the line.You'll find this and much more by heading to sytaylor.substack .com and hitting subscribe#fintech #ipo #neobanks","Transactions 1,Data and Analytics",0

"I know you might not believe this...but Chime has more ""primary"" customers than JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consumer research conducted by Cornerstone Advisors sheds some light on Chime's customer base and their demographics.On the heels of Bloomberg reporting that Chime is planning an IPO in 2025, I thought it was about time I looked at Cornerstone Advisors' consumer research to size Chime's (and other leading #fintech providers') customer base.According to a July 2023 survey of US consumers, Cornerstone estimates that Chime has more than 38 million customers--about half of whom consider the neobank to be their primary checking account provider. That works out to 8.1% of all American adults (check out the Forbes article below for the breakout by generation).In contrast, Wells Fargo has 8.5% of the market, and Chasethe nation's largest bank (in terms of assets)counts 7.6% of Americans as primary checking account customers.

"You're hired on as the CDO or Head of Data.The company tells you it wants to Transform the company with data-driven insights and unlock AI capabilities.The organization expects this team to generate 8-figure cost savings or revenue generation. Obviously, the prospect of this role and the expectations were exciting, which is why you took it. Then, after you've settled in, you realize there's1. No foundational data infrastructure 2. Massive amounts of tech debt3. Immense resource gaps4. Shadow IT operations5. Siloed departmentsAll these are somewhat expected from an org that has immature data processes, but each extends the timeline for progress and tangible ROI on the platform significantly. Adding to all this, the data leader likely doesn't report directly to the CEO, and their funding is cut because they report to another department with higher priority initiatives.This is a common reality for many data leaders where there's a disconnect between the desired outcomes of leveraging data and the effort, resources, and time needed to build a proper data platform to enable basic and advanced use cases. Scenarios like this are also why data leaders have short tenures (<2 years) between quitting (burnout, lack of support) or getting fired (impatience, lack of perceived ROI).Companies must be prudent in developing their data platform and hiring the right data leader to connect the data to the business. Chasing new shiny objects (AI) or having insane expectations (8-figure cost savings) will cause an endless revolving door of data leadership with little to no progress. #EGDataGuy","Leadership,Data and Analytics",1
"Robinhood is a lending company. Fintech VCs need to stop saying they won't invest in lending companies. Robinhood is $18 billion mkt cap and their revenue growth is coming from...lending.  This isn't just about the new credit card. Robinhood Gold drives most of their revenue growth and Gold monetizes primarily thru lending. They already have margin lending, which is INCREASING 40% yoy.  Their non-lending trading revenue is DECREASING. Their new credit card will monetize not on interchange (giving 3% cash back means no net interchange revenue). So how will the credit card monetize? lending.  net interest income on revolvers (ppl who carry a balance)It's not that surprising. their average AUM is <$5k client. it's hard to monetize on those users in a repeatable way other than lending (having them day trade options works ok, but not everyone will do that). Lending at Robinhood could be as big as rest of their business combined.If you invest in fintech, your best companies will one day monetize thru lending even if they don't start there, because lending is one of the most important monetization levers in financial services.","Data and Analytics,Transactions 1",0

"Thoma Bravo's Annual Meeting wrapped up last week in Miami and it's always a great opportunity to share perspectives with our LPs and answer probing questions that investors rightly ask, as we together aim to make sense of an extraordinarily complicated  and incredibly interesting  business environment in 2024 and beyond.  I gave a detailed presentation on the state of the software market as we see it today. Sharing here a couple of charts from that presentation that to me encapsulate the core of our firm's investment thesis and distinctive value proposition.  In our view, software isn't a traditional sector, but a set of tools that is moving across all sectors of the economy to improve efficiency, customer experience, and productivity. The SaaS market  now in its third decade  continues to grow annually at around 20% organically, a reflection of enterprise software's durability, positive ROI and also how much time it takes for general purpose technologies to be put to effective use. We believe software is a compelling way to invest in the economy because good software companies generally have higher growth rates, higher gross margins, more contractually recurring revenue and (yet) operate far less efficiently than the average non-software company in the S&P 500.  We work to improve those operations and transform software firms into sustainably profitable businesses. This takes expertise, patient partnership, and a lot of capital  particularly as software businesses continue the trend from this past decade of getting considerably larger. Enterprise spending continues to grow across IT, software and SaaS in 2024 and is expected to continue to grow beyond. We surveyed company executives who indicated that their businesses are only, on average, about 50% through their digital transformation journey. Most companies in the economy are probably less than halfway through the journey of digital transformation that we expect literally every company in the economy will transit. Add the new capabilities of AI to the mix, and it is likely that we are just in the early days of an entirely new chapter in the digital transformation story.  It's an exciting time to be investing and operating in the software space.","Digital Transformation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",0

"2 tools that I see companies buying all the time that they may not need: Round Robin and Quota.Round Robin:This is a pretty easy one to build in Salesforce. With 2 custom objects and a flow, you can build your own Round Robin to evenly (or unevenly) distribute any kind of record to your team. Easy to maintain. Easy for users and managers.Quota: This is a big maybe for me on whether or not this should be built in Salesforce. Using the same framework, we have built really cool quota functionality that can quota off of opportunities, opportunity splits, revenue schedules, a custom object, etc. with different levels of quotas. (i.e. an individual quota rolls up to a team quota rolls up to a parent quota rolls up to a company quota). Both of these are really simple builds that will scale with you. So, the question always comes into play: Build or Buy. The answer is 'it depends,' but we have built out some really cool solutions for clients who chose to Build.

"Analytics doesn't drive value. Actions do. But, how to identify insights at scale, and action them at scale? This has been the holy grail of procurement analytics, but - after 20 years of working at the problem - I really feel we've reached the promised land. This partnership between Sievo (surfacing procurement insights at scale) and Pactum (actioning those insights at scale) well unlock huge potential within currently inactioned long tail of procurement opportunities.  (The most valuable question to ask is: ""What are the procurement decisions/actions currently NOT done that I can replace with Sievo+Pactum""). And, it will be an important milestone in changing the role of humans in procurement decision making.

"One of the first things we do with new portfolio companies is nail down how we'll talk about performance of the business. But we don't just hand our team a report. We build our ""data diet"" together - and it looks like this.A few things you'll notice: 1   We take a ""Less Data, More Often"" approach. We pick a few key metrics to report on every week, and then decide together which metrics warrant less frequent review. We try and get the rhythm right - and only include the metrics in our weekly report that we'll actually talk about. 2  We start with questions (not metrics), and we keep the list short. Starting with a list of questions helps ground our reporting in the things our teams are already discussing when we're not there - and allows us to start getting ""exit ready"" by incorporating the questions we know we'll eventually get asked in a diligence process. 3  We clarify the definitions of our metrics and we set targets. We take the extra time to define what each KPI means and how we'll calculate it, and when possible, we set a simple target - even if it's early and we don't quite know what we don't know yet. Structuring your own data diet is a relatively simple exercise - but it's one of the most powerful methods there is to start getting a grip on your business and get yourself out of managing by gut-feel.

"Only day 2 at #asca24 and it has reinforced so much of what Clarify Health is doing with its price transparency data and why the ASC and #ambulatorycare market, in particular, will benefit so greatly by leveraging our platform!

My key takeaways from the sessions are that for Managed Care leaders to succeed in their roles, all paths MUST start with data collection - only you understand your business best - not a consultant, not an advisor, not a vendor, and not the payer you're negotiating with. So what does data collection mean and how can you tell the best story of your business to ensure you level the playing field in your negotiations? 

1. Understand your market - how saturated is it? what rates are other ASCs being reimbursed for the same services and for the same payers? what other ASC options are there around you?

2. Communicate your service - what is the quality of care that your physicians are delivering in your ASCs? Leverage case mix-adjusted performance scores to talk to the CMO and their medical directors at health plans to share this information on how you benchmark against other ASCs and/or HOPDs

3. Explain your savings - compare your rates against those of HOPDs apples-to-apples to show where you're saving dollars for your health plan partners!

4. Show the impact of driving more volume - See what procedures and services are being delivered by site of care in your market or markets you're expanding to and assess what additional savings you can drive by shifting more of that.

5. Find opportunity - are there creative ways for you to be framing your asks based on this data? e.g., should you be thinking about asking for a slight uptick on the Medicare rate given how much you are saving by shifting that spend out of the hospital setting? 

Controlling the narrative is so important in conversations and negotiations and meaningful data will empower you to do just that. Clarify Health Solutions empowers all four bullets above. Come talk to us to learn more!

- Understanding aspects of Healthcare Operations
- Understanding frameworks and application of Process Improvement

"We pulled the plug on our Amazon cash cow  and you won't believe what happened next...



Sounds like a clickbait title, right? But that's exactly what we did. We paused our fastest-growing, most profitable sales channel  Amazon   just as we hit UK bestseller status. 

Were we mad? Maybe. But we had a hunch that a lot of the growth from Amazon was taking away from Shopify - which means less data in Meta, higher CPAs and lower confidence in spend. We knew the only thing to do was follow our gut and test the theory. By turning Amazon off and seeing what happened next.

Let me set the scene. Amazon was skyrocketing: week-on-week growth, ROAS through the roof, each purchase profitable.

Meanwhile, our DTC acquisition costs were ballooning, profits sliding. Conventional wisdom says double down on Amazon, right? Well in this case....wrong.

We did the unthinkable and binned Amazon off, gambling on a hunch that it would improve our DTC sales as Amazon customers migrate back to our website, allowing Meta to optimise faster and improve conversion performance overall. 

Heart in mouth, we flipped the switch two Fridays ago.

Day one: Amazon sales nosedived , website sales didn't budge. Was this an expensive mistake?

Day two: website sales ticked up. But just a bit. Hmm. Maybe we were wrong?

Day three: WHOOP! Best sales day in weeks, lowest CPAs since December 
. Our hunch looked like it was paying off.

The past couple of weeks, we immediately saw CPAs lower, CM3 improve, and therefore have been able to increase spend again and restart our prior pace of experimentation.

So, what's next for Amazon? We know there are some sales we're missing out on from not being on there right now and we've not yet decided where we go next on that channel. If you've got thoughts on this, I'd love to hear in the comments.

Moral of the story though: Your P&L only tells half the tale. Trust your instincts and take those risks to uncover the hidden opportunities for growth.

A big shout out to Josh Lachkovic at Ballpoint, Stuart Worgan at eClarity, and Shaun M. for being the best in the business and giving us the confidence to take these big bets.

"Ryan's insights like the deal cycle times are always a goldmine for benchmarking and reality checks in our industry. His latest post got me thinking about the standard deviations across different deal sizes and days as these are the ""sound barrier""

We are bound by the laws of nature, in this case, the speed at which companies can make decisions.

The question is can we bend the laws of nature with changes in our approach? One of the more interesting changes that bends nature is purchase with hyperscaler commitment dollars. Can my purchase be counted towards my AWS/Azure/GCP purchase and be done on the marketplace? This will not turn a deal at 200K to act like one under 10K. However, these are the types of ideas that can bend nature and expedite purchases.",Data and Analytics,1

A seasoned lifecycle marketer once told me that the key to unlocking retention can often come from the right acquisition strategy.

When peer-to-peer marketplace Mercari US entered the U.S., they faced stiff competition from giants like eBay and Craigslist. They needed a strategy to attract new users and build a community that encouraged return buyers and sellers. To accomplish that, they partnered with GrowthLoop to leverage #BigQuery and activate their predictive models to drive retention. 

Together, GrowthLoop and Mercari....

 Used predictions to identify retention features, and then built out initial segment definitions based on those features. 

 From there, the Mercari team used the results to design and launch experiments with GrowthLoop, refining audiences based on performance

 Mercaris marketing team could now build their own customer lists using predictive models without requiring continuous support from other teams. This drove major retention and revenue lift impacts.

Focusing on churn with data science, automated activation, and consistent experimentation was the key to unlocking retention.

"One of Procter & Gamble's strategic priorities is to lead with deep consumer insights, which help us deliver breakthrough innovations and superior products that better peoples everyday lives. 

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry loads carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now Tide Cold Certified  meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well  or even better  in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. Its a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And were proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tides ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

"The AI revolution is in full swing, but where are the women? In some of the most recent AI panels, discussions and summits I have been at women are sorely underrepresented. It was so stark that some of the men at these events even made comments about it. Which I really appreciated because we absolutely need their support with remedying this issue. This imbalance will greatly hamper the development of AI solutions that truly reflect the needs of our society.

As a data person, I needed some baseline data!! A survey by Junior Achievement (JA) conducted by the research group Engine shows that only 9 percent of girls between ages of 13 and 17 are interested in careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). This is down from 11 percent from a similar survey in 2018. Why are girls less interested in careers in STEM and how do we get them interested? 

Additionally, companies must implement targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain female talent especially in the field of AI. Statistics show that women will not apply for positions unless they feel they are over 90% qualified for the job. They may need to be nudged to apply for jobs that they have the aptitude for. I can personally attest to this. Much of my career moves came from gentle nudging.

Now more than ever, mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide invaluable support and guidance for women entering the AI field. Knowing there are others they can relate to and garner support from will make a huge difference. At any AI event I go to, I find other women to talk to and it instantly puts me at ease. 

Interested in thoughts on how we can get ahead of this issue before its too late. This is a real problem..
