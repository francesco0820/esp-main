https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-mcmillan-bb8b0a5/,"Memorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, was established after the American Civil War. The first widely recognized observance was on May 30, 1868, when Major General John A. Logan, leader of an organization for Northern Civil War veterans, called for a nationwide day of remembrance. On that day, Americans were encouraged to decorate the graves of soldiers who had died in the Civil War with flowers.

For many years, I have used this day to celebrate and remember my West Point 1989 classmates who are no longer with us. They all left us too soon.

This Memorial Day weekend, if you know a parent, spouse, child, or sibling of someone who served and died, please reach out to them personally. Let them know you remember their sacrifice and that you care.

Here is the full list of my classmates who are no longer with us.

Be thou at peace.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamstowitts/,"Last week I graduated from The University of Nebraska with two master's degrees: an MBA with a finance specialization, and a Master of Science in Business Analytics.

This was an incredibly rewarding experience. My roles in my 30+ year career have generally been highly technical. Finance and Analytics were both interesting fields that I knew would make me better as a technical and operations leader.

My experience at Nebraska College of Business was outstanding. When I first started looking at programs, I was primarily interested in curriculum, particularly in these areas of finance and analytics. Which program included the classes that I thought I would enjoy taking? Nebraska was the best choice for me easily, offering a great selection of classes and a dual degree program that allowed additional coursework in both areas of study that I was interested in.  It is also a tremendous value – having been ranked as high as #1 in the country for value among online MBA programs in recent years. I couldn’t agree more.

I’m very appreciative of the support I received (both generally and financially) by my employers: originally Ball Metalpack and then by acquisition Sonoco Products.  Both organizations have been incredibly supportive of continuing education.

The support from my family was awesome. This was a demanding journey that I was trying to navigate – with a wife and three young children at home, and a senior leadership role in my day job. For the last four years, I dedicated 4am – 6am every day + additional weekend hours as needed to my studies.

This entire experience was completed, start to finish, while I was in my 50’s. I was almost always the oldest student in my classes and often older than the professor. There were lots of opportunities to share professional experiences in these classes, and I like to think I brought many interesting ones to our discussions.

What next? Well, 50-something years old is not too old to go back to school, and not too old to keep working at my most important job, as Dad. Mallory and I will welcome our 4th child in the next few weeks, right before my 54th birthday!

If you’ve been kicking around the idea of going back to school: do it! It’s never too late to keep learning! I couldn’t be more excited about my path over the last few years.

 Finally – if you’re worried that my years with Nebraska might have changed my college football priorities – well, I always cheer for the Irish first on Saturday. But when they aren’t playing….

As a wife of a firefighter/paramedic, it means a lot to my family to honor the First Responders!  I’m often reminded of how fragile life is, and how blessed we are for the brave first responders who selflessly risk their lives to save ours.

But what we don’t talk about enough are the lives they couldn’t save, and the load they still carry wishing they could’ve done more.

Mental health awareness is needed more than ever with a suicide rate at an all time high for our firefighters.

While we honor our fallen brothers and sisters, let’s also support those still with us carrying the load.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-osborne-b83486166/,"Zions Bank and World Trade Center Utah (WTC Utah) Crossroads of the World truly put Utah on the map as they brought some of the worlds most influential leaders

A few Highlights

⭐️Former President George W. Bush was wonderfully engaging and personable. His humor had the crowd roaring and should be a stand up comedian, however his humor was interspersed with truly insightful and deeply meaningful (sometimes emotional) discussions on the hardships and care he has had for not only for the people of our nation, but all people — the women and children harmed as we left Afghanistan, the challenges for those impacted by our border challenges with Mexico, and the anger experienced on 9/11. Making me realize just how much broader our perspectives need to be.

⭐️ Mexico’s former President, Vicente. Fox discussing the opportunity for nearshore resourcing — so true, and I am working with companies in Utah that are building strong workforces based in Mexico and see how much we could expand in this arena.

⭐️ Former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper was insightful on trade economics, and not onboard with any of the current proposed Utah National Hockey League (NHL) team names. (I tend to agree and truly hope “Yeti” does not stick!)

⭐️ Recognition of the incredible impact Scott Anderson has made to our state presented by our current Governor Spencer Cox along with prior Governors Gary Herbert, Jon Huntsman and Michael Leavitt

⭐️ Meeting with Derek Kitchen, prior State Senator and current Sr. VP & Deputy Director Congressional on the work happening within Export-Import Bank of the United States and FireFly Automatix, Inc.

⭐️ UVU President Astrid S. Tuminez interview with Richard Haass created awareness of the sensitivity of our global relations, the risks, and our role in becoming  informed. Having a marine son stationed in Okinawa these conversations become all too real, and his direct calls to action were welcomed (I did leave having bought 2 of his books.) 😂

⭐️Listening to Macky Sall reminded me of my time spent in Senegal  🇸🇳 in 2016 and saw first hand the impact of small investments being turned into massive change across the country. My time there was the foundation of the work I am now doing at Tech-Moms .

⭐️Wrapping up with Bear Grylls hyping us up and helping us face failure & fear with fire 🔥

Utah truly has placed themselves at the forefront of global engagement enabling future growth. We are all changing the world in our own way, and left informed and inspired.  Well done.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulerio/,"I had the privilege to participate in the first ever event between ALPFA New York and Bank of America Employee Resource Group HOLA NY titled: “Breaking Into Tech.” The event was hosted by Bank of America in New York City.

This event featured a panel of Latino technology executives who shared their experiences and expertise in the ever-changing tech landscape with ALPFA members from the Tri-State area.

The panel was moderated by Johanna Cordisco, MBA & featured fellow executives Erika Bustos & Piedad Burnside.  They did an excellent job and as usual, really brought their entire authentic selves to the event.

I want to recognize Damian Rivera, CEO of ALPFA for taking time out to be there in person as well as HOLA/ALPFA officers Luis Gasca, Daniel Roque, Angela M. Rucks, Michelle Cisneros, Benjamin Rene Garcia and Jaqueline Ramos.

Damian Rivera & Benjamin Rene Garcia, I will hound you both at every event until I get that ALPFA Inc - Association of Latino Professionals For America pin!

For all the attendees who we connected with after the panel, let's see some comments!  You all did you did a great job as well.  Without you, there is no event.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonybender/,"Well, that was fast! Just when I finally land my dream job at SAP the company announces a global restructuring. So, sadly, this week will be my last with SAP.

But, by any measure, I’ve had a great run during my almost 18 year tenure.  I’m so grateful to SAP for all of the professional opportunities I’ve had over the years, to the SAP customers I’ve been privileged to interact with and learn from, and to all of the incredible leaders and amazing colleagues I’ve had the opportunity to work with – past and present – so many of whom have become good friends.

Too many people to thank and acknowledge but a few I’d like to highlight to whom I’m especially grateful:

Al Kenney for 20+ years of friendship and for being my bridge to SAP. Peter T. Brandt for bringing me in to SAP and for helping me get started on this journey. Joerg Koesters for wearing every hat possible with me for the last 17+ years – coach, collaborator, manager, peer, advocate, co-conspirator and, most of all, great friend. Franz Josef Schoppengerd for your early mentorship, years of industry collaboration, continued friendship, and more than a few memorable meals along the way. Ram Jambunathan for your years of mentorship and inspiration, along with Alexa Gorman, Paul White, Max Kahn, Lior Weizman and the entire SAP.iO team for helping to contribute so much amazing innovation opportunity to Consumer Industries. Jeffrey Harvey for your relentless optimism and can-do spirit through thick and thin. And, finally, E.J. Kenney, Matt Laukaitis, and Lori Mitchell-Keller for your leadership, example, coaching and advocacy. I would not have had the career I’ve had at SAP without your encouragement, support and sponsorship.

Wishing all of my SAP colleagues all the best for continued success going forward.  As for me, I don’t yet know what's next but I’m excited to find out. For now, I plan to take a little time off to recharge and reassess and then looking forward to seeing what the future holds!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonybender/,MISC,post,Text,Tony,Bender,Culligan,Consumer & Industrial Products,Global CIO,2024-07-01 16:36,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7202174145822953472,,,,,,212,137,0,1mo,Congrats on a great run Mark!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,"I remember how nervous I felt a year ago when launching NEXT 🫣

Absolutely crazy that we’ve welcomed 300 members in the past year, selected from over 2,000 applicants 🤯

NEXT Careers members are all figuring something out – landing a new role, founding vs joining, building a fractional portfolio, if they should leave their current role, or some other transition moment.

Creating a space for entrepreneurial people to be authentic and vulnerable allows us to accelerate each other’s decision-making by tapping into our collective experiences and network.

This spirit of generosity is how we’ve been able to grow in such a high-quality way: almost half of the most recent cohort was referred by a program alum or a speaker.

I’m so grateful to truly hundreds of people who have helped build NEXT. From the amazing speakers who led over 100 live events, dozens of VC firms recruiting for their portco’s, supporters who have referred their most talented friends to join as well as the members co-creating this experience alongside me.

Really proud of the impact NEXT has had on the careers of hundreds of the most talented people I’ve ever met.

We’ve just opened up applications for our fourth cohort kicking off in a month and I’m so excited to meet our incoming crew 🤗

In a previous post, I shared an image of an arrow on a tree I took while out hiking with my family that deeply resonated with me. It symbolized guidance and forward momentum in both my personal and professional life. The arrow reminded me of the beauty in growth and change, encouraging us to step out of our comfort zones, take the path less traveled, and trust the journey.

I'm thrilled to announce the next chapter in my professional journey as I join Wells Fargo as a Technology Executive in the Identity Access Management space!

My decision to join Wells Fargo reflects their iconic logo – the stagecoach journeying towards the new frontier of the West. This symbolizes new beginnings and endless possibilities for me. This imagery serendipitously aligns with my own journey towards growth and new horizons, acting as a declaration of growth inspired by my recent reflections.

It reinforced the importance of being present and understanding the challenges the community faces.

I am incredibly proud of our community health team in Hawaii and their dedication to working alongside our communities to develop meaningful, impactful, and culturally relevant solutions focused on health and resilience. A special thank you to David Tumilowicz, Lisa Kimura and Vivian Pham, MA, PMP for their unwavering support and commitment to our communities.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-deeringer-232a8b8/,"Before the month of May comes to a close, I want to share the story of my husband Ed.  His last 16 months of life did not come close to defining his immeasurable impact on the lives of so many but he fought everyday with every inch of his body, mind, soul and heart.  He fought past boundaries and limits he shared with me & long after what he defined as his dignity- all to spend every moment he could  with our girls and I.
Ed, like many glioblastoma patients was a picture of health. He exercised, relentlessly, scrutinized everything he ate. He was committed to a vegan diet. He pushed himself beyond his potential every single day of his life. That’s who Ed was. That is Ed’s legacy.
 In April 2022 Ed was diagnosed with a glioblastoma, but not just your average glioblastoma, his tumor was a diffuse midline glioma uncommon for someone his age. It was also unmethylated and had a lethal type of mutation- all things that excluded him from most if not all clinical trials.  He had his first surgery 4 days after his diagnosis on April 6. He woke up and recovered extremely well. Two weeks later on May 4 he started six weeks of radiation and chemo and we traveled to the city every five days a week for 6 weeks.  Ed had MRIs every 1-2 months depending on the findings. During that time, our family lived one moment at a time surviving MRI to MRI. It continued to start the doctors with his progress, with his determination and positivity. The doctors would always remark that he never  “matched” his imaging. However, in October 2022, just 6 months later, MRI showed a small suspicious spot with hydrocephalus, (fluid accumulating in his ventricles). He had a second brain surgery for the insertion of a VP shunt and a biopsy. He woke up with weakness to his right side, but after a couple of weeks was pretty much back to baseline and the biopsy showed good news -the number of active growing cells was low.  Until in March, he started having some back pain.  The cancer had spread to the membranes around his spinal cord- he was given 3-6 months to live.  Then he contracted shingles in his right eye and scalp.  Some of you may have seen the PSA he did in the hospital urging people to get their shingles vaccine.
On April 20th we made the decision to start hospice. When he was in hospice where we almost took him off because he was doing so well:  lifting weights & he signed up for the New York City marathon.  Our girls and I had the honor and privilege to love and care for our Ed until his last breath.  We never left his side as we walked him home.
I will never forget the conversations we had during those countless hours in waiting rooms.  He wanted to make things better for patients like him and families like ours.
So now I run and post for Ed.  I will be running the NYC marathon in November fundraising for National Brain Tumor Society
Please join me in spreading awareness and supporting this organization.

- Becoming a senior as the spring semester officially closes, while also working and being a caretaker for several members of my family.

- Jumping into the UX/UI field by earning Google’s Foundations of UX Design Certificate.

- Being given the chance to be a part of the Feliciano Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation at Montclair State University this coming semester. This will lay the groundwork to start an organization that gives back to my community.

- Graciously accepted as an intern at the world’s top bank, in a program that I am wholeheartedly honored to be in.

As I marked the completion of my two-year Cone Health administrative fellowship last Friday, I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me on this journey.

Over the past two years, I have had the opportunity to work alongside an incredible team, learn from experienced mentors, and take on new responsibilities that have pushed me out of my comfort zone.

But it's not just the skills and knowledge that I've gained that I'm grateful for. It's the people who have made this experience so special. To my colleagues, who have become like a second family to me, thank you for your kindness, guidance, and encouragement. To my mentors, who have taught me so much and believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself, thank you for your wisdom and support. And to ELT, who have given me the freedom to grow and take on new challenges, thank you for your trust and confidence.

This fellowship has been an incredible opportunity for me to develop my skills, build my confidence, and prepare for my next chapter. I am forever grateful for the experience.

To anyone who is considering applying for a fellowship or similar program, I highly recommend it! The growth, learning, and connections you'll make will be invaluable.

At one of my son’s recent high school graduation, I was inspired hearing the wonderful ambitions so many young men and women are pursuing.

If I had known then what I know now, here are a few things I would tell new graduates:

1-The best opportunities for you may be far from home; pursue them now before other family and life demands grow in complexity.

2-Stay in contact with your good high school friends over the many years ahead; long friendships can be among the richest and they will eventually need you, and you them.

3-It sounds like everyone has a plan and their life is all perfectly mapped out while you are left behind trying to figure things out. They don’t. Move forward and make each achievement a building block for the next one.

4-If there was a special someone you always wanted to date in high school but didn’t, ask them out now. You’re out of high school and nobody cares anymore.

5-Your parents are suddenly much smarter now than they have been the past four years you were in high school. Ask for their advice and actually listen to it.

6-If you stay in shape, you’ll never have to get back into shape.

7-The best employers look for talent, then passion, and then personality. Develop those, and you will always be in demand.

8-The decisions you now make over the next four years of your life will determine much of what the rest of your life looks like. Shoot for the stars and don’t settle for subpar.

9-If you didn’t like the “box” that you were in or known for during high school, change it now. You write your present and future however you want it.

10-Thank your teachers and coaches every time you see them from now on. Decades from now you will still be quoting them and doing those same drills they had you do with your children’s teams that you coach!

The future is bright for all 2024 graduates and here’s to wishing you the very best of success!!

Karla was an incredible wife and mother to our two sons, Collin Johnson and Connor Johnson. During our 32 years of marriage, I witnessed her love and generosity touch everyone she met.

Karla devoted her life to helping others and had a particular passion for pets, especially German Shepherds. Her commitment to education and pet shelters was a testament to her generous spirit. Karla was not only the family planner and holiday host but also a loving sister and daughter who brought joy and love to every moment.

Many have asked about how to honor her memory. In lieu of flowers, Karla would have preferred donations to her scholarship fund. This non-profit ensures that 100% of the contributions go directly to deserving scholarship recipients.

And finally, I’m thankful for all the incredibly talented and kind people I get to work with on the daily who make me feel cared about as a person – you guys make work fun and enjoyable! And to the team who made this all possible – those who are still on team DD and those who have gone on to grow their careers elsewhere – I will forever be grateful to you for what we built together. We’ve come a long way in the past six years and have so much to be proud of, and none of it would have been possible without you.

Overall, I just feel really lucky to be here🥹 Here’s to many more! 💚💚💚

https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-samuelson-1751901b/,"I wish everyone a Happy Pride Month.  At this time in our history it is as important as ever for employers to recognize that organizational diversity leads to more informed decision making, a cohesive workforce  and better economic outcomes.

As we celebrate Pride Month I encourage you to educate and bring along those who oppose the tenants of this month long celebration; inclusion, acceptance, joy, belonging, diversity.  These projectors of supposed 'virtue', who exist in most organizations and societies and who we all unfortunately have contact with, are the creators of exclusionary constructs that want to control you, maintain power and exert self-righteous mores rather than partner, grow and develop you as an individual.  They exist to the detriment of social, corporate and organizational cohesion.  Projected virtue in this sense is merely the marriage of caution and hypocrisy.  Speak openly about this hypocrisy to reveal to them and the world that  diversity is the reality of the human condition, even when they don't want to see it.  We are more successful as a species and a society when the full rainbow is seen!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikodakalla/,"""At the World Championships in Budapest in June, USA’s Anita Alvarez sank to the bottom of the pool.

Looking across the deck, then noticing she was under way too long, her coach, Andrea Fuentes immediately dove in after her fully clothed, pulling her to safety. Anita was unconscious and didn’t have the capacity to kick, paddle, or help herself in any way.

If Andrea had not have noticed, she would have drown.

But she knew Anita.
She looked for her, quickly noticed she was under too long, (nore than normal)
then dove in without thinking twice.

This has resonated with me….

When you are under too long, who are the people that will look for you, notice you aren't surfacing, and dive in to pull you to the surface when you lose your strength to swim in life?

Who are the people that would do that for you?

And can someone count on you to be that person that would go looking and notice when they are under too long, diving in to support them when they are all out of fight and fuel to swim in these turbulent waters we call life?

https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelnbloch/,"Das ist die ""Secret Sauce"" hinter heyMia: 🤫

Vor gut einem Jahr war heyMia nur eine Idee. Heute haben wir eine Recruiting-Plattform mit fast 4.000 Talenten und über 200 Kunden. Wie haben wir das so schnell geschafft?

➡️ Unsere “Secret Sauce”: Low-Code Tools! 🧙

Von Anfang an haben Lukas Wohlgemuth und ich auf Low-Code Tools gesetzt, um technologisch sehr schnell voran zu kommen und einfach iterieren zu können.

Das sind die wichtigsten Tools, die sich bei uns bewährt haben: ⬇️

🧠 Airtable: Das Gehirn unseres Geschäfts! Damit managen wir unseren Talent-Pool und das CRM, und wir automatisieren Prozesse vom Onboarding bis zum Accounting. Mit Automation Scripts senden wir WhatsApp-Erinnerungen, berechnen Talent-Bewertungen, erstellen die Talent-Dossiers für Kunden etc.

🌐 Make: Oft benötigen wir neben Airtable noch andere Services/APIs. Mit Make verbinden wir Airtable unter Anderem mit Gmail, Google Drive, Zoom, WhatsApp und PDF-Tools. So können wir komplexe Prozesse abbilden.

💻 Webflow: Unser Webseiten-Wizard. Die erste Version haben wir mit einem angepassten Template (schnell & günstig!) gebaut, inzwischen haben wir unser eigenes Design entwickelt und bald gehen weitere Features auf heymia.ch live.

📱 Heyflow: Unser Tool zum Erstellen interaktiver, mobil optimierter Flows. Damit führen wir Talente und Kunden durch den Onboarding-Prozess und können die benötigten Informationen einfach abfragen.

Als “engineer at heart” bin ich beeindruckt, was dank Low-Code Tools heute möglich ist und wie schnell man damit technisch anspruchsvolle Produkte bauen kann. Und es macht richtig Spass mit diesen Tools zu arbeiten!

Ganz ohne Coding gehts natürlich schon nicht, auch wenn die Tools das gerne so versprechen. 😅 Mittlerweile ist unsere eigene Codebase ziemlich gewachsen. Aber hätten wir die Low-Code Tools nicht zur Verfügung gehabt, hätten wir viel mehr selber entwickeln müssen. Das wäre deutlich teurer gewesen und hätte ein Vielfaches der Zeit benötigt... 🐌

Ich kann Low-Code Tools zum Aufbau von neuen Startups/Produkten und zum Automatisieren von Prozessen also nur empfehlen. ✅

Was sind deine Erfahrungen mit Low-Code Tools?

➡️ Möchtest du Low-Code Tools zukünftig in deinen Projekten oder deinem Unternehmen einsetzen, um die Effizienz zu steigern oder schnell neue digitale Produkte zu bauen? Let’s get in touch! 📥

https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-lloyd-35b26218/,"#PhysiciansAtHLTH

HLTH takes place every October in Vegas, and will take place this year on Oct 20th - 23rd.

For the last few years, I've created schedules and guides for physicians attending HLTH.  I'm a fan of these conferences because they focus on emerging healthcare technology, serve as a great way to network with physicians who have interesting non-clinical jobs, and feature a ""who's who"" speaker and panel lineup of leaders from hospitals, tech companies, and policy groups.

During prior conferences, physicians have been under-represented largely due to the cost of the event and because CME is not included.  However, both of these are going to change:
👨‍⚕️ HLTH has a new ""Physicians at HLTH"" track and they will be offering CME for some of the talks this year (https://lnkd.in/gJCDncND).
💲 Additionally, HLTH and Nisha Mehta, MD's Physician Side Gigs are going to be offering free admission for 200 physicians.  (more info here: https://lnkd.in/g_XaV_Yn and application here: https://lnkd.in/gKs7z5wZ)

So far, only a few speakers have been announced (Tom Mihaljevic, CEO of Cleveland Clinic and Joaquin Duato, CEO of Johnson & Johnson).  HLTH will also feature pitch competitions, American Medical Association's Physician Innovation Network events, StartUp Health company talks by physician founders, companies like Zus Health that are requesting physician feedback, and great parties 🎉.

Here is a link to a ""A Physicians Guide to HLTH"" I wrote about a past event (https://lnkd.in/dMzdb9X3).  I also included an the HLTH23 calendar, and I'll be making an HLTH24 calendar once more speakers and events are announced.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-lloyd-35b26218/,MISC,,Image,Stacy,Lloyd,American Medical Association,Healthcare Providers,"Director, Digital Health & Operations",2024-07-01 17:28,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204879141219778560,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFu2Vk-G-VvYg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1717346502543?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=X4VaE3Rm_Fh4z7XLW2M6RiQQHH1_xF-5AM9bufwLu4Y,,,,,64,17,1,4w,,,,Stacy Lloyd likes this,,,2024-06-07 16:17,,,,,,,,,Friday,8:17 PM,6/7/2024,,,,,,,,,

In startups, we agonize a lot over efficiency and scaling. But we do very little in our personal lives to become more efficient or scale our impact.

I used to drown in my inbox, occasionally putting up a vacation responder to assuage my guilt about taking a while to respond.

Then a 💡 went off. Why not keep the away message up ALL THE TIME? Most people want the same dozen or so things from me. And with a permanent away message I can triage these requests efficiently.

And with all that saved time, I have been able to write more blog posts to address some of the most common questions I get. Again, going from 1:1 to 1:many.

Hammack's departure from Goldman in February was just the latest sign that the glass ceiling at the investment bank is still impenetrable. Despite its pledges to diversify its management ranks, Goldman has never had a female chair, CEO, president or CFO.

I wrote for Bloomberg Opinion at the time that we don’t know exactly why Hammack decided to leave, but we have plenty of clues. The company passed her over as CFO in 2021, instead moving Hammack into a position it claimed would eventually lead to a more senior role. (Spoiler alert: it didn’t.) And that’s despite being described by colleagues and industry insiders as a “unique talent who dedicated her life to the firm,” a “deep intellect” and “bound for higher office.”

She was said to have lacked “the swagger” of Goldman’s high-fliers and kept her “ties to a number of illustrious industry figures under close wrap,"" encapsulating the lose-lose position in which women at Hammack’s level frequently find themselves. Too little swagger and she’s considered “atypical” for Goldman; too much and research suggests she would risk being marked as overly ambitious.

The most striking and cringe-worthy anecdote I read about Hammack came from a former Goldman executive who told Bloomberg News in 2020: “She’s brilliant and she can explain the most complicated things in standard English. Once I thought of challenging her and asked if she could explain something in a Haiku.”

There’s a metaphor there — the impossible standards women at the top are held to, the extra mile they are asked to go, how little their time is valued. And no surprise, Hammack delivered the haiku first thing the next morning. So why did she leave? Maybe she just got tired jumping through all those hoops and never landing at the top.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,MISC,,Article,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",2024-07-01 16:02,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7205145619248623617,,,,,,619,42,21,1mo,,,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-23/shake-ups-at-goldman-sachs-and-boeing-show-glass-ceiling-remains?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=linkedin,Fariha Greenwood likes this,,,2024-06-08 09:56,,,,,,,,,Saturday,1:56 PM,6/8/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,"So about six weeks ago, we decided to launch Joseph’s Challenge - No Limits. The intention was to raise £100k and the challenge is for Joseph, who has Down Syndrome, to try and run 10x10ks in 10 countries in 5 days at the end of August starting from a running base of zero.

If you want to support him please donate at
 https://gofund.me/5cc8d709 and if you want to follow Joseph’s progress, please follow him at https://lnkd.in/eUVjyueH.

The fundraising has gone so well that,including pledges, we are very nearly at our initial target of £100k and are now in the process of launching plans to create a social enterprise to support adults with special needs with training and employment opportunities in addition to hiring a disability sports officer. Massive thanks to all who have donated so far.

It’s been a big week this week with Joseph recovering from a knee injury, appearing on BBC and being a guest of the wonderful Chair of the FA, Debbie Hewitt in the Royal Box at Wembley receiving a signed Harry Kane shirt in recognition of his fundraising efforts so far. Joseph says he is more famous than his three sisters now….

We are also able to announce our first official partner, the wonderful Travelcounsellors, who are going to help manage the logistics of getting to 10 countries in 5 days with one or two jogs in between !!

We chose the title No Limits for this fundraising because when Joseph was born he spent three weeks in special care, didn’t walk until he was nearly three and everything we were told and read was about the limitations of a child with DS.

Lessons learned so far :

1) I am not very good on Instagram (I am managing Joseph’s Challenge account) - my youngest daughter tells me it’s sad to be following more people than follow you so please help me by following Joseph’s Challenge
2) I love the fact I am at an age where I don’t care about 1) !!!
3) Some people think it’s wrong to put someone like Joseph through a challenge like this - all I say to them is if you want to take him on at butterfly go for it !!!!
4) Most people are incredibly kind and go out of their way to support you when you put yourself out there
5) I am still afraid of failure and won’t relax until we have a social enterprise up and running
6) Joseph has taught us that if you go for 1% improvements and don’t cap your expectations or focus on a single target, you can really surprise yourself
7) Dont be afraid to ask so please donate !!!!

As part of our purpose to help protect the planet, Culligan has teamed with WILDCOAST, a coastal conservation organization based in California, to fund three solid waste retention systems that collect plastic and other waste before it enters the Pacific Ocean.

By the end of year one, Culligan expects to have prevented more than 40,000 pounds (about 18,150 kg) of plastic – the equivalent of three African elephants – from entering the ocean.

I will miss this challenging and fulfilling learning journey where I connected, collaborated and competed with the brightest minds 🧠. I highly recommend this program to all Data Science, AI/ML enthusiasts who are looking to dive deeper. Best wishes to all!

Developing a portfolio 📂 (https://lnkd.in/eN_vtVFE) of industry-relevant hands-on Data Science and Machine Learning projects using python and participating in Hackathon 🤼, applying all the learning 🤓 to increase the accuracy of the model, has been a great motivator and confidence booster 💪. I am really excited to put these skills to innovative work 💡 in real world applications and dive deeper 🏊‍♀️.

None of this would be possible without the unwavering support 😍 of my husband (Ritesh Shrivastava), kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, extended family and friends! Celebrating my graduation from this program along with my daughter's (Prisha Shrivastava) graduation 👩‍🎓  from high school is an adorable memory to cherish forever :)

Given the 240-year history of the Bank of New York, we are fascinated by the perseverance that has defined our company.

Let this history inspire us to apply excellent engineering principles to all we do. Remember that quality is a habit more so than a performance. We work at it not occasionally but always, tenaciously, and resiliently.

Imbedding quality into what we do is a marathon, not a sprint.
Above all, one needs resilience. It also demands for patience. Accept the challenges, learn from our mistakes, and never give up on improving moving forward.

Best assets of BNY are its #people and its #resilience. Collaborating, we can protect BNY tradition and encourage originality and excellence in whatever we do.

To 240 more robust years to come! Happy Founders Day! #1784 #1869

Congratulations to our 2024 cohort of incredible physician-leaders from all across the Houston Methodist system who graduated today from our Physician Leadership Development Program held in conjunction with Rice Business - Jones Graduate School of Business.

Over the past six months, they have had the invaluable opportunity to learn from both seasoned executives at Houston Methodist and distinguished professors at Rice University. This program was meticulously designed to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary for effective leadership.

Today, our physician leaders showcased their group projects addressing current priorities within our system. It was wonderful to observe how they applied their program learnings to devise practical solutions that will significantly impact our entire healthcare system.

A special thanks to all of the capable executive sponsors of our team projects @Wayne Voss, Roberta Schwartz, Sarah N Pletcher, MD  MHCDS, Shawn Tittle, janet leatherwood, and the thoughtful leadership of Carla Braxton MD, MBA,FACS, FACHE. I very much appreciate the partnership of Michael L. Koenig and Zoran Perunovic who were instrumental in the design and development of this unique learning experience.

It’s illuminating to see our customer-facing #Comericans in action and witness the solutions and service they deliver firsthand. Their passion, commitment, and drive are a force to be reckoned with.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyceoh/,"It seems like today when you ask people how they are doing they always say “busy.” It’s as if “busy” in and of itself were the goal. Here’s what an AI search had to say about “busy” : Being busy doesn't always mean you're productive or making progress towards your goals. Being busy can be a state of constant motion without a clear purpose or direction. It can involve juggling multiple tasks without making significant headway in any one area. Being productive, on the other hand, is about making effective use of your time to generate results and move closer to your objectives.

Let’s get unbusy and get focused.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyceoh/,MISC,post,Text,Joyce,Oh,Moffitt Cancer Center,Healthcare Providers,Chief Information Officer,2024-07-01 17:42,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206230186973954049,,,,,,75,12,2,3w,,,,Joyce Oh likes this,,,2024-06-11 09:46,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,1:46 PM,6/11/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanpdoherty/,"After an incredible 35 years at EY, I am excited to let the LinkedIn world know that I will be retiring at the end of this week. There are too many acknowledgements to include all the great colleagues, clients, and friends I have worked with and learned from over the years in this post. However, I would like to take this moment to show my appreciation for Aaron Hipscher who left this earth way too soon and showed an incredible amount of confidence in me that I never would have found in myself. He took a chance on hiring me initially into the firm saying he knew this SUNY Binghamton kid from the Bronx had untapped potential. During the interview process, he insisted that I stop by the Arthur Young office after I had a 2nd interview with every other firm to check in with him. Aaron’s tremendous recruiting skills were evident when I landed in Vero Beach on September 11th, 1989, for 2 weeks of audit training. Thanks to him I was lucky enough to start my career with an amazing group of people that continue to be fantastic friends to this day.

During my 35 years at EY, there were times I got antsy and considered leaving. However, each time the power of mentoring helped redirect me to an interesting project or opportunity within EY where I was able to leverage the tremendous insight I had learned from auditing some of the most innovative derivative trading companies early in my career.  These experiences included two adventure filled overseas secondments to Tokyo, Japan.

Starting my next chapter, I am excited to share my experiences and insights with my Financial Statement Analysis students at Fordham University next semester. I am hoping I can sway some of them to enter the exciting world of Public Accounting. If that doesn’t work, I will just have to play Ben Affleck’s Accountant 2 in class when it is released!! In addition to teaching, I am excited to consider taking on some board positions to leverage my deep experience working with Japanese and US financial institutions as well as Private Equity clients throughout my career.

I feel so grateful for all the incredible experiences and relationships I’ve cultivated during my time at EY. I have worked with some of our largest Banking and Private Equity clients and so many talented and amazing people. Thank you to everyone I have worked with for all of your support over the years. I look forward to staying in touch as a new chapter in my journey begins!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanpdoherty/,MISC,,Image,Sean,Doherty,State Street,Banking,Senior Vice President - Operations Transformation,2024-07-01 16:20,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206994653307359235,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQF8ded0DRmBUg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1719172637380?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=IutbLbeyGSyXT_QMKn-jRnyB8NsR5kVGEv9IHTRiskc,,,,,1050,319,0,2w,Congratulations Sean!,"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7206345417762951168/?commentUrn=urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7206345417762951168,7206994649817755649)&dashcommentUrn=(7206345417762951168,urn:li:ugcPost:7206345417762951168)",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7206345417762951168,Sean Doherty commented on this,,,2024-06-11 17:23,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,9:23 PM,6/11/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertalschwartz/,"We had a packed house yesterday at Houston Methodist where we hosted American College of Healthcare Executives members from across the country for a curated Innovation Open House.  My colleagues and I presented on some of our key strategic initiatives including responsible AI use, patient access redesign, and ambient intelligence in the operating room. We then toured the group around our Tech Hub and Virtual Operations Command Center.

Here are some of the key messages shared from our leadership team:

Jordan Dale, System Chief Medical Information Officer - Whether you realize it or not, you probably use AI every day from spell check on your phone to navigating with Google Maps and much more. AI tools are an important part of our innovation strategy at Houston Methodist to continue leading medicine, and we are committed to using AI safely and responsibly with an AI oversight framework that ensures human agency remains a top priority.

Tesha Montgomery, Senior Vice President for System Access - Our health system serves a massive population with the footprint of Houston being larger than some entire states in the USA. In surveying our patients, convenience rises to the forefront with a majority of patients stating that they would switch providers due to convenience factors alone. With our digital front door committee and patient access team, we are constantly working to improve all new technology that is patient facing and are proud to share that almost half of new patient appointments are successfully scheduled online.

Evan D. Collins, MD, MBA, Chief of Hand & Upper Extremity Center, and Rose McCullough, Director - Implementing ambient intelligence tools in our operating rooms over the past 18 months has significantly improved our OR scheduling and efficiency. In collaboration with our vendor, we have been able to make the technology work specifically for our needs at Houston Methodist.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertalschwartz/,"We had a packed house yesterday at Houston Methodist where we hosted American College of Healthcare Executives members from across the country for a curated Innovation Open House.  My colleagues and I presented on some of our key strategic initiatives including responsible AI use, patient access redesign, and ambient intelligence in the operating room. We then toured the group around our Tech Hub and Virtual Operations Command Center.

Here are some of the key messages shared from our leadership team:

Jordan Dale, System Chief Medical Information Officer - Whether you realize it or not, you probably use AI every day from spell check on your phone to navigating with Google Maps and much more. AI tools are an important part of our innovation strategy at Houston Methodist to continue leading medicine, and we are committed to using AI safely and responsibly with an AI oversight framework that ensures human agency remains a top priority.

Tesha Montgomery, Senior Vice President for System Access - Our health system serves a massive population with the footprint of Houston being larger than some entire states in the USA. In surveying our patients, convenience rises to the forefront with a majority of patients stating that they would switch providers due to convenience factors alone. With our digital front door committee and patient access team, we are constantly working to improve all new technology that is patient facing and are proud to share that almost half of new patient appointments are successfully scheduled online.

Evan D. Collins, MD, MBA, Chief of Hand & Upper Extremity Center, and Rose McCullough, Director - Implementing ambient intelligence tools in our operating rooms over the past 18 months has significantly improved our OR scheduling and efficiency. In collaboration with our vendor, we have been able to make the technology work specifically for our needs at Houston Methodist.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/neelchopdekar/,"Last week, I had the pleasure of joining Noelle Eder and thousands of my colleagues at our tenth annual Cigna Technical Conference. Together, we discussed one of our greatest enablers – technology – and how we can harness it to deliver more value for those we serve today, and for those we will serve in the future.

While reflecting on our strategy, our accomplishments and our areas of opportunity, I shared some words of advice I think apply to us all.

Always look for bright spots rather than flat spots. As humans, we are wired to look for the flat spots when something goes wrong. But if we switch our mindset to seek out the bright spots, we can delve into what is going well, learn from it and apply it to achieve even better outcomes in the future. By continuing to learn and share in service of our mission there is nothing we can’t accomplish together.

Reflect and remind yourself that an accurate criticism is the most valuable feedback you can receive. Imagine how silly and unproductive it would be to respond to your ski instructor as if he were blaming you when he told you that you fell because you didn't shift your weight properly. It's no different if a supervisor points out a flaw in your work process. Fix it and move on.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-lloyd-35b26218/,"I am glad to see that the recent Peterson Health Technology Institute (PHTI) report on virtual MSK care aligns with the broader body of evidence supporting the efficacy of virtual physical therapy. However, I am disappointed that several studies used to support the efficacy of “PT-guided” care do not mention the involvement of a physical therapist in the intervention. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and every state practice act make it clear that one must be licensed to practice physical therapy to call their services physical therapy whether that care is delivered virtually or in-person. Grouping non-PT interventions under “PT-guided care” weakens a report that otherwise delivers an accurate assessment of the opportunity for virtual physical therapy to deliver value in MSK care.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-zitney-8137898/,"As I take on new challenges and interests, I wanted to mention some of the people who have influenced me a lot and express my gratitude. I could not have asked for a better growing experience than that of the State Street Board who has been consistently ranked among the top 25 global boards. As I start serving on boards you will remain my North Star on how an effective board should operate. I would like to thank Dame Amelia Fawcett DBE, CVO Lead Director, Sean O'Sullivan Chair Tech & Ops Comm & Marie Chandoha Chair Risk Comm. Sean, I will forever treasure your support & guidance.

Thanks Ronald O'Hanley, for your support for diversity & inclusivity. #FearlessGirl continues to fearlessly inspire thousands everyday.

Steven Fay CPC Federal Reserve Bank Boston, you & your team were highly supportive & appreciative of my efforts, very grateful. Tough, when needed, but collaborative, you embody how effective regulators should operate, both ensuring the smooth functioning of the US Financial System, while challenging the industry to get better. Thanks Michael Bertulli, Ed Charlton, Linda Lue-Bezzat, Janele Cooper & Jeffrey Baglioni

To former colleagues,
Lou Maiuri, you rock. Never met an executive who can operate so effectively from board room to the mail room, from the “C” suite to the “Coding"" suite & everything in between. To Andrew Kuritzkes what an unbeatable second act !!, as CRO for the nation’s CHIPS program your impact will last decades. Thank you Barbara Diette, Wynne Rumpeltin, Kris Wulteputte, Ajay Mathur, Mark Corteil, Jacqueline Angell, my risk comrade in arms

Thanks to my business partners over the years for keeping a risk mindset - Brian Franz, John Plansky, Antoine Shagoury, Sarah Berwick, Ram Puppala, Ann Fogarty, Adeel Saeed, Elizabeth Joyce, Andrew Zitney, Aman T., James Hardy, Jit Vekaria & Kishore Kottapalli.

As leaders we are only as good as our teams - leaders look tall because they are being carried by Giants. To my team of giants, I am so incredibly proud of all that we have achieved. You have punched way above your weight class & helped establish one of the best cyber/tech/3rd party/resilience/operational risk programs in the industry. You did it by advising business leaders on how to get to YES rather than saying NO. Thank you Gnana Chavali - especially for boot strapping our Center of Excellence (CoE), thanks Sandip Biswas, Richard Flood, Alain Gresse, David Smith, Dewayne Sharp.

To the global non-financial risk team, you defined what seamless & operating as one means. Your espirit de corps was the engine that drove the group. Each major crisis is different 9/11 to 2008 financial Meltdown to Covid, threats change from cyber/climate/AI. One thing I have learned over the years, is that risk is never constant & always shape shifting. What is constant & does not shift, is how an agile, data driven, team of risk professionals can help a firm overcome these crises & emerge stronger. You have done that and more.

While waiting in the lobby to see my eye doctor, a man walks in and greets the staff like they are family. He laughed with everyone, knew everyone’s names, shared jokes with them, and treated them like his own.

When I first looked his way, I knew I recognized him. It looked like Richard Davis, but I didn’t want to say anything. For those of you that don’t know Richard Davis, he was the CEO of U.S. Bank during the financial crisis and how he led the company through it truly inspired me.

At that time, all major banks were roiling because of the market crash and the failures of multiple financial institutions. As strong as U.S. Bank was, the company was not immune to feeling the impacts. Instead of cutting jobs like many other banks were doing at the time, he offered a different solution. Everyone will take a 5% pay cut and nobody loses their job. I was just a 20 hour teller at the time while I was going to school. I really didn’t have any sense of how significant that idea was until I looked back on it. Everyone gave a little bit so that we could all make it through the hard times together. That last word, together, is the key part.

Mr. Davis’ leadership and example has inspired me throughout my career. First and foremost he taught me that employees are not just numbers or financial burdens, they are the members of a work family and are the key to a successful business. Happy employees are more productive and ultimately produce better results. While at the helm of U.S. Bank, he truly believed in that philosophy and it permeated throughout every level of the organization.

Returning to my story from earlier, the office staff called him by name. “Hey Rich!” At that moment, I knew it was, indeed, Richard Davis. I greeted him by name, he quickly stood up and shook my hand, and we shared a conversation. I also knew I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to get a photo with him. Obviously I wasn’t dressed the best, but who likes to go to the doctor in work clothes?

It was an honor to meet you, Mr. Davis!",https://linkedin.com/in/beverly-steele-72a8173/,MISC,,Image,Beverly,Steele,U.S. Bank,Banking,"SVP, Operations Digital & CX Leader ",2024-07-01 16:24,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207939002019041281,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQG1-7KOayeTVw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718475087592?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=Dc6djuf2ai0LMc9yACFklTSPqF7fdhhG0jrbxOSAFmY,,,,,1748,209,13,2w,,,,Beverly Steele likes this,,,2024-06-16 02:56,,,,,,,,,Sunday,6:56 AM,6/16/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,"From Senior Prom to Senior (Young!) Citizens: A 53-Year Love Story

As we mark Loving Day today, June 12th, I am reminded of the enduring power of love and resilience. In November 1971, a few years after the landmark Loving v. Virginia decision, considered one of the most significant legal decisions of the civil rights era, a senior boy asked a junior girl on a date (my/our first date). We attended a concert by Motown’s one and only Temptations (the original singers, I might add!), which turned tempting parents on their heels. We were high school students at a Catholic school, and our decision to go on a date was met with significant backlash. The school administration and several parents expressed dissatisfaction, calling the school to voice their disapproval. Yet, amidst the uproar, my parents, originally from Alabama, and his parents, from Montana, stood by us.

Some civil rights history: In 1958, Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Loving, a Black woman, were married in Washington, D.C., where interracial marriage was legal. Upon their return to Virginia, they were arrested and charged with violating the state's anti-miscegenation laws, specifically the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. This law prohibited marriages between white and non-white individuals, reflecting the entrenched racial segregation of the time.
The Lovings—how fitting that their last name was Loving—were sentenced to one year in prison, with the sentence suspended on the condition that they leave Virginia for 25 years.

Unwilling to accept this injustice, they challenged the conviction, leading to a Supreme Court ruling on June 12, 1967. The Court unanimously declared Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, stating that such laws violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Earl Warren asserted, ""The freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State."" Reflecting on this historic decision, it's sobering to consider how today's Supreme Court might view such a ruling.

Note: It wasn't until 2000 that Alabama officially removed its anti-miscegenation law from the books through a public referendum, underscoring the deep-rooted racism and resistance to interracial marriages even decades after the Loving decision.

Our journey from that first date in 1971 to celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary this summer is a testament to us and to the progress and challenges that remain in society. We have been together for almost 53 years, dating nearly eight years before getting married. We continue to witness the good, bad, and ugly societal attitudes toward #interracial and same-sex relationships.

We hope that by sharing our journey, we can educate and inspire others about the importance of love, equality, and the ongoing fight against #discrimination in the broader struggle for marriage equality for everyone.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,MISC,,Image,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",2024-07-01 16:02,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208666309209796608,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQGShOaf8CMfXg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718219595795?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=OTSozSMorJSBlB-RkJdo8cV5cK5BDJnXbNXgiD-HxrI,,,,,10750,570,148,2w,,,,Fariha Greenwood likes this,,,2024-06-18 03:06,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,7:06 AM,6/18/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikodakalla/,"20 yr Workiversary

Thanks to the many friends, colleagues, and clients who congratulated me over the last week regarding my 20th anniversary with Frost Bank. It’s been a great ride, and I’ve no intentions of getting off any time soon.

Milestones are funny things though. I realized, for example, that I’ve now worked at one place longer than I lived in my hometown of Knippa! Or, that the city I moved to (MSA of ~ 1 million in 2004), having just been ranked the fastest growing MSA in the country for a staggering 12th consecutive year, is no longer a mid sized college town, but now a burgeoning internationally recognized City of 2.4 million - with all the perks and challenges that come with that kind of growth. Or that the company I joined would evolve into a top 50 bank in the US with nearly 200 branches and industry leading people and products (see #1 in customer satisfaction JD Power rankings,  or best mortgage lender in Texas by CNN).

And when I think back on the kid I was back then, I realize just how fortunate (blessed) I’ve been these past two decades to have people in my life who’ve gone out of their way to help mentor and guide me along the way. While too many to thank individually, there are a few I do have to call out specifically. Ronnie Miksch, Tim Crowley, Will Ingram, Keith Donahoe, John Schawe, John Greenwood, Ken Gates -  Your kindness, direction, and coaching (yes Ro, I’m talking to you) made me the banker I am today. I’ve still got lots to learn, but I owe each of you a great deal for your help along the way.

I want to close with the thought I shared with the team last Friday morning as we celebrated with some chicken minis (cause everyone loves those things!). And that is, I’m more optimistic today about the future here at Frost than I’ve ever been. It feels like Frost, and specifically the Austin team, is having our moment in the spotlight, as we hire up and grow across the region. I couldn’t be prouder of the people I get to do that with, and if you need a good bank to help you, or your company, give me a call, I genuinely would love to help.

Cheers y’all.

⁣
It came out 5 years before I was born. There are six career options for women; a ballerina, model, actress, flight attendant, nurse and teacher. At the time this board game came out, it was very progressive because women weren’t encouraged to work at all. THIS WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO!!! Let this reminder be what fuels you to dream big, take risks, be bold, disrupt industries, invent, redefine the conventional image and definition of success, and never let fear hold you back from trying new things or from becoming the best version of yourself. ⁣
⁣
Think of all the women who came before us that never got the chance. Every day I wake up with gratitude for more options, and deeply appreciate the women and men who came before me who spoke up, showed up, and pushed society to allow women to be deemed worthy enough to vote, worthy enough to get a business loan, and ultimately decide what they want to become. ⁣

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennes-zhang/,"I’m honored to share that I have been elected to HP’s Board of Directors!

Over the weekend, just before my appointment, I had the opportunity to visit the HP Garage – the birthplace of Silicon Valley! It’s where college friends Bill Hewlett and David Packard decided to start their very own company back in 1938 and went on to blaze a trail, sparking technologies that continue to shape the world today.

The HP Garage is an enduring symbol of innovation and entrepreneurship, two elements that underpin HP’s vision to create technology that makes life better for everyone, everywhere – every person, every organization, and every community around the globe. And I am thrilled and inspired to be part of this.

I’d like to express my sincere gratitude to the HP Board for entrusting me with this responsibility - I look forward to guiding HP into the future and contributing to its continued success.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-costa-cio/,"For those who’ve asked…

Yes, it is the best Father’s Day gift I’ve ever gotten. But not for the reason you think.

As parents, Neil and I tell the kids they can be anything they want; that no dream is impossible. And that no one succeeds alone.

How extraordinary when you can show your kids that what you’re telling them is true.

I feel so grateful to have been part of this team, where everything worked because everyone worked together. From the lighting, sound, and scenic design, to the costumes, wigs and makeup; from the story, score and orchestrations, to the cast, crew and choreography. With an outstanding team of producers and a director who brought a brilliant vision and - with genius and generosity - let her team do its best work to bring that vision to life.

I feel humbled to have been in the company of our fellow nominees, each of whom illuminated the human experience through their art.

Thank you and congratulations to The Araca Group, Matthew Rego, Michael Rego, Hank Unger and Cristina V., to my friends Sue Gilad and Larry Rogowsky, to American Zoetrope, Angelina Jolie, all of our co-producers, the team at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, our brilliant director Danya Taymor and the amazing cast, crew and creatives who take us, every night, to Tulsa, 1967.

I feel so grateful to my parents, who always let me be me; and my husband, Neil, who always catches me.

And to my wonderful kids, who fill me with wonder and remind me that anything’s possible:

Ignore the people who tell you, you shouldn’t. Tune out the voices that tell you, you couldn’t.
Embrace those who tell you, you should, could and will. And, as Kecia Lewis said last night:

Lea also joined some of our Swiss events throughout the years and always made sure to be giving back to the startup community. She is a real role model!

So, of course, when I first read about the AVA Women exit, I was really happy for her and her team, and then once I heard about the acquiring company declaring bankruptcy shortly afterwards, I was quite saddened at the thought of how this would affect them.

I'd been trying to get Lea on the podcast to talk about everything she's learned along the way for a while now, and it wasn't until startup days 2024 in Bern that I finally succeeded. It was touching, deeply personal and really eye-opening.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mukesh-kamani-633926/,"I am beyond excited to share that I have recently graduated from the MIT Executive MBA program MIT Sloan School of Management

It’s hard to believe it’s been 2 years since I started this journey, and I can still feel the excitement, inspiration and trepidation in taking on something seemingly monumental. Buckle up, they said.

I went all-in. I said Yes to every opportunity, I challenged myself, I got out of my comfort zone, I dug deep, I had big wins and and balancing setbacks, I persevered, I learned, and I transformed. 👩🏻‍🎓

I explored my strengths as a systems thinker and a sensemaker, I leaned into my passion for community development, I expanded my reach, I developed lifelong friendships, and I defined my mission to make impact through climate solutions. 🌱

I also learned that I might have missed my calling as a game show host.

The timing of this education was also magical. Being a student at MIT during the AI revolution was pretty special. AI will continue to transform our lives in ways that nobody fully understands yet, and we had a front seat for it. Seeing the transformation from a variety of perspectives and most importantly through intimate conversations with top leaders driving the vision, steering the evolution and adoption of the technology on a day-to-day basis and shaping the AI enabled world we all live in..  Definitely a highlight of this education. 👩🏻‍💻

With the pace of change in the world today, coupled with the speed of technological advancement and unprecedented geopolitical instability, polarization and climate change, leadership is needed more than ever, and thoughtful leadership makes all the difference.

I’m most encouraged, excited and hopeful about the work I’ve done to discover and develop my leadership signature, the uniqueness of my particular style, and for the safe environment in which I could take risks, test out some new ‘material’ and bring all of it to bear in activating my vision.

I couldn’t possibly be more grateful. For the opportunity to build a community with this incredible group of people, and for the unwavering support of my friends and family. It has been amazing to expand my tribe and chart a course with you all.

After an incredible journey at Microsoft, I am announcing my departure from one of the most powerful, innovative, and talent-rich companies in the world. I feel truly blessed for my time here and have met so many incredible people who will remain friends for life. 🏆🥇

I have made the bold decision to leave my favorite workplace to strengthen and utilize my capabilities in transformational leadership, a passion close to my heart. I have said yes to one of Danish history’s most significant transformation cases at TDC Erhverv, where I will take on the role of Senior Vice President for Enterprise and join the Executive Board.

Starting July 1st at TDC Erhverv, my responsibility will be to accelerate the sales of end-to-end solutions and advanced services to enterprise and public customers. This initiative aims to solidify our market leadership as the only provider capable of delivering across all technologies.

There is a special reason I chose TDC Erhverv:
""TDC Erhverv is a strong and iconic brand that is on an exciting and ambitious transformation journey. My passion and strength lie in transforming organizations through modern change management, making a noticeable difference internally in the company culture and contributing to strengthening customers' digital journeys and business results. I look forward to contributing to strengthening our focus on spreading end-to-end value-based digital and AI solutions for the benefit of Danish society.”

I would like to thank Microsoft for the most developing years of my career. You are sending me out into the big world so much wiser and prepared for the challenges ahead. Thanks, from the bottom of my heart. ❤️

Thank you to the leadership, my team, my colleagues, and ALL our partners and friends in the ecosystem. You have ALL made the last 3.5 years incredible. #MemoriesForLife Together, we have built history. Thanks for everything ❤️ Thanks for all your support, partnership, and innovation.

See you all again one day 👌 And to all my new friends - see you soon. I’m so excited to meet you all…

Our life is a book consisting of many chapters. This is just one of them. 😘 Remember to enjoy every step you take... We don’t know how many we will take.

❤️ Thanks, AB ❤️

I love this video because it shows that someone who is considered incredibly talented NOW was absolutely awful early.

He got good by practicing incredibly hard - not just because of natural abilities.

Most of the great joys in my life are on the other side of being horrible at them early. Being an entrepreneur. Writing online. Helping CEOs solve problems.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikodakalla/,"20 yr Workiversary

Thanks to the many friends, colleagues, and clients who congratulated me over the last week regarding my 20th anniversary with Frost Bank. It’s been a great ride, and I’ve no intentions of getting off any time soon.

Milestones are funny things though. I realized, for example, that I’ve now worked at one place longer than I lived in my hometown of Knippa! Or, that the city I moved to (MSA of ~ 1 million in 2004), having just been ranked the fastest growing MSA in the country for a staggering 12th consecutive year, is no longer a mid sized college town, but now a burgeoning internationally recognized City of 2.4 million - with all the perks and challenges that come with that kind of growth. Or that the company I joined would evolve into a top 50 bank in the US with nearly 200 branches and industry leading people and products (see #1 in customer satisfaction JD Power rankings,  or best mortgage lender in Texas by CNN).

And when I think back on the kid I was back then, I realize just how fortunate (blessed) I’ve been these past two decades to have people in my life who’ve gone out of their way to help mentor and guide me along the way. While too many to thank individually, there are a few I do have to call out specifically. Ronnie Miksch, Tim Crowley, Will Ingram, Keith Donahoe, John Schawe, John Greenwood, Ken Gates -  Your kindness, direction, and coaching (yes Ro, I’m talking to you) made me the banker I am today. I’ve still got lots to learn, but I owe each of you a great deal for your help along the way.

I want to close with the thought I shared with the team last Friday morning as we celebrated with some chicken minis (cause everyone loves those things!). And that is, I’m more optimistic today about the future here at Frost than I’ve ever been. It feels like Frost, and specifically the Austin team, is having our moment in the spotlight, as we hire up and grow across the region. I couldn’t be prouder of the people I get to do that with, and if you need a good bank to help you, or your company, give me a call, I genuinely would love to help.

Cheers y’all.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,"I’m happy to announce that after what felt like the longest 7 months of my life, I’ve finally removed my green banner! I’ll have more on where I’m going next and the people who were instrumental in helping me get there a little later on.

For now, there are a couple of things at the very top of my mind as I start the next chapter of my career:

Without my support system, I wouldn’t have made it through the last half year. First and foremost, I want to thank my wife Erin Powell, who was my financial and emotional rock throughout the weeks and weeks and months and months of applications, cover letters, interviews and disappointment. She kept me together and kept our family’s collective heads above water, and I don’t know where I’d be right now without her. Someday, I’ll also tell my son how, as a toddler, he helped his dad through one of the most challenging periods of his life just by being a smiling and giggling source of joy, energy and motivation who served as a much-needed distraction from my situation. My family, friends and former colleagues have all been heavily involved in keeping me going. The messages of encouragement and support. The offers to help set up connections and conversations, or to even just take a look at my resumé and offer feedback or advice. The silver lining through all of this is that I have a lot of people in my corner, more than I ever even knew, who were willing to be my champion or a sympathetic ear. Words can’t adequately express my gratitude for the love and support I’ve received since day one when I was laid off and nearly every day since. I was down bad, and you all helped lift me up.

To my fellow green banners who are still hoping to get that call or email with a job offer attached to it, I want to let you know that I see you and support you. The job market is a cruel and miserable pit of despair right now. The ghosting, rejection and silence can all feel overwhelming at times. People can tell you there will be light at the end of the tunnel, and while there will be, it can be so hard to look beyond your current situation. It’s always easy to tell you not to take things personally, it’s just business, but few things impact your personal life more than your professional life. It’s okay to feel angry or frustrated or sad. All I can say is to keep going, believe in yourself and your talents and, most importantly, take the occasional day to yourself to do the things that you love with the people you love. Something will come along eventually. If ever there is a chance for me to help you the way so many others have helped me along the way, please reach out. Unemployment is a long and lonely road, no matter how many people you have in your corner, so don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I believe in you.

Lea also joined some of our Swiss events throughout the years and always made sure to be giving back to the startup community. She is a real role model!

So, of course, when I first read about the AVA Women exit, I was really happy for her and her team, and then once I heard about the acquiring company declaring bankruptcy shortly afterwards, I was quite saddened at the thought of how this would affect them.

I'd been trying to get Lea on the podcast to talk about everything she's learned along the way for a while now, and it wasn't until startup days 2024 in Bern that I finally succeeded. It was touching, deeply personal and really eye-opening.

I am all for clamping down on illegal immigration but we need to fix the legal immigration mess. Policy towards the spouses of citizens and legal immigrants has been outright cruel.

America is a land of immigrants and its economy totally depends on immigrants to keep growing. America has not had an employment problem for a long time. Its dependence on Filipino nurses is absolute, almost 35% of nurses in US are from Philippines. Its dependence on Indian American IT engineers is also fairly absolute. Same is true in agricultural sector where Mexican labor has become indispensable. 15% of the US population is foreign born. Close to 30% of the population has an immigration  connection.

In 2023 alone, more than 1,800 projects were nominated by 82 committees from around the CP world — with five ultimately selected for the YCMAD Global Award. Receiving this is humbling because I know how impactful and deserving the other projects are.

This week, we were recognized by our Board of Directors and CP’s senior leaders at a special gala dinner; received a stock grant and learned about what it means to be a stockholder at a special visit to the New York Stock Exchange; celebrated with a sail and dancing in New York Harbor; and so much more.

Shout-out to the Values Team based in London, Toronto, New York City, Basel and Johannesburg: Brad Watt, Viviana Moreno, Jenn Porter, Kevin Jordan-Deen, Stephanie Bereday, Vigla Clarke-Allison, Jean-Christian Heinzelmann, Priyan Pillay and Balunji Nkhwazi — and to all the 2023 Global Winners!

I feel immense pride for being recognized and seen not just by CP’s senior-most leaders and peers but also by my partner Matthew Kelleher, who was included as my special guest for the week’s festivities.

Thanks Matt for recognizing me too! 🥰🥰🥰

Congratulations and thanks to Mitali Chopra, my Global Corporate Communications teammate and YCMAD Program Global Employee Chair; our creative director and event MC Kevin Bender; and Melissa Covington in our CFO’s office, who were crucial to the success of this celebration week alongside a strong, driven team of 30 colleagues.

My hot take on the whole experience: change is inevitable and we can’t possibly do everything.

She lost her father, Marine Captain Matthew Bancroft, when he was killed in action during a deployment to Pakistan in 2002. Maddie shares her experiences with the Folded Flag Foundation by saying, “I am profoundly grateful to the Folded Flag Foundation for the support that they have provided me with and the opportunities I have because of their generosity. This scholarship program holds a dear place in my heart and helps me succeed in working toward my dreams. When I was eight months old, my dad passed away while serving in the Marine Corps. My mom was left having to raise me, along with my two brothers, and it is something that I know was not easy for her. We feel blessed for the patronage we are given. The Folded Flag Foundation has helped us tremendously with my being able to attend college. At USD, I studied in a neurobiology lab, worked as a pre-health peer mentor, and was president of the Neuroscience Club! In the Fall of 2024, I plan to attend physician assistant school to become a PA. Through my experiences at the University of San Diego (USD), I am passionate about my academics and future career and highly grateful for the wonderful relationships I have formed with my peers and professors. I graduated in May of 2024, but I can only recognize this accomplishment by acknowledging the generosity that I have been supported by with Folded Flag Foundation.

Thank you to Modern HC for the honor. Thank you even more to my friends and colleagues at Elevance Health, who do such inspiring work on behalf of our members and communities.

They are all truly great leaders and I endeavor to learn from each of them.

And — let’s be honest — there are so many worthy clinical leaders and execs not on the list this year. For all of our problems in US healthcare, a paucity of smart, thoughtful clinical leaders is not one of them. We could fill a list of the next 50 leaders, the 50 after that, and the 50 after that, and on and on. I want to thank every clinical leader I have worked with, learned from, been in awe of.

https://linkedin.com/in/beverly-steele-72a8173/,"It's week two of summer break in our household. And that means we're in full swing of summer sports, camps and lake time with my three kids. My entryway is a sign of the times, piled high with Crocs, sports gear and swim goggles.

While I love summer (who doesn't in the Land of 10,000 Lakes), I have to admit it requires a serious shift in my mindset as a working parent. The mental gymnastics required to manage all the logistics of who is going where and when is real - and some days it feels like a part-time job! And don't get me started on managing the budget for ice cream, Starbucks and Culvers runs.

At Brillect, we have several (and might I add rock star) consultants who have opted to take the summers off. Some of them have done it for years; others are trying it for the first time this summer. But the common thread between all of them is that taking the summers off is a win for them, their families and our clients.

I believe that work life integration comes in all shapes, sizes and seasons. Finding that right-size role starts with listening to what people need in order to thrive at work + in life. Because there's more to us than our job titles.

We're a company made up of triathletes, pilots, pickleball fanatics, canoe craftsman and yes, parents who are juggling all the things in the busy summer season.

Some people may want the time off to care for children while others have booked a bucket list trip or want to finish a passion project.

No matter what the reason, we keep our focus on the whole person - not just the work person - to shape a career that recognizes where they're at in life.

Here's to summer and finding time for all the things that bring us joy.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-blake-mba-880a11/,"On November 1st, I am going to retire or as I like to call it “re-mission” from Ascension.  It has been such an honor to serve the Catholic Health Ministry not once but twice in my career.  It was such a privilege to be able to bring my faith to work and not have to separate faith from profession.  I am so grateful to Ascension and its leadership for the opportunity provided to me.  My wife, Liz, and I are going to take a sabbatical and discern about how to re-mission for what we call our third-third.  We want to continue to serve our community and our faith in perhaps a different way than we have done so far.  Below is the announcement that Joe Impicciche sent out internally on my announcement.


Peter Leibold, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer, is planning to leave Ascension on November 1. He will remain engaged with Ascension by serving as a member of the Ascension Foundation Board.  A servant leader, Peter worked diligently to advance Ascension’s Mission and was a key leader in helping our organization navigate through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Advocacy worked with Finance, Legal and Operations to clear regulatory hurdles, obtain needed flexibilities and advocate for significant provider financial relief that was essential for Ascension to serve its communities and take care of its associates.  Peter joined Ascension in 2014 and led his team by emphasizing transparency, communication and results. During his tenure, he celebrated Advocacy’s role in expanding Medicaid in Oklahoma, promoting growth in supplemental payments to several of our ministries, advancing spiritual care as a supplemental Medicare benefit, and discerning with ministries how to comply with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare. Peter brought his whole self to his role, living out his deep faith by advocating for Ascension as a ministry of the church.   Peter is a member of the Ascension Leadership Team, Ascension Leadership Academy Community 4 and the Executive Ministry Leadership Formation Cohort 13.  He received the David J. Greenburg award, the highest honor provided by the American Health Law Association (AHLA) for service to the health law bar. He has served on various foundation and church boards.   Before joining Ascension, Peter served as the CEO of the AHLA for 15 years and was General Counsel of the Catholic Health Association for three years.  Peter’s departure in November provides Ascension time to identify and transition a successor.   Please join me in thanking Peter for his service to Ascension and his dedication to our Mission.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-blake-mba-880a11/,MISC,post,Text,John,Blake,Ascension Health,Healthcare Providers,National Head of Health Payers Technology at Ascension,2024-07-01 17:30,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209759807417765889,,,,,,473,205,0,1w,,,,"John Blake, MBA likes this",,,2024-06-21 03:31,,,,,,,,,Friday,7:31 AM,6/21/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mastephen/,"Today, I would like to extend my appreciation to my colleague and friend, Patrick McElhaney. I had the pleasure of meeting Patrick shortly after joining WBA, and he quickly became a valuable ally and collaborator. Through his introduction to the Engineering Accelerator, I discovered that the greatest strength of working at WBA lies in its people, along with the exceptional level of support available for innovative ideas.

Patrick seamlessly stepped into a leadership role within our team when our acting Chief Architect departed from WBA. He assumed many of his responsibilities, overseeing our Architecture Assembly and effectively bridging the gap between our technology and product divisions. His efforts have been instrumental in establishing a strong foundation for our technology teams during a period of leadership transition.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-romano-23b3b974/,"Let's recap what appears to be complete BS against Trump. The man wins an election against an unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton
. They pay for a fake dossier and claim it's not the American people who elected him but the Russians. A Special Counsel is appointed, millions of dollars are spent, and the conclusion is that there was never any collusion between Trump and the Russians. It was the American people who elected him. It was complete BS.

Once in the White House, a woman writes a memoir and claims Trump sexually assaulted her several decades ago. Trump says no, I never did what she is accusing me of. New York then changes the law so she could bring charges decades after. She's actually unable to provide any direct evidence because she waited decades to report the alleged assault. The case proceeds anyway; eventually, after back and forth, Trump has to pay her millions of dollars for defamation. In interviews, she says she can't wait to receive the money so that she can go shopping worldwide. She also says the sexual assault was never sexual; claims rape is sexy. The media ignores the inconsistencies because that's not what the so-called deep state wants.

A porn actress also comes out and says she had an affair with Trump decades ago, and Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. The government says, wow! That's such huge information, had the American people known that they would have elected Clinton. Several people say there's no case to be made there; eventually, the case goes to court with the government claiming that he did not specifically disclose that the legal fee was somehow a campaign contribution. Anyway, they convict Trump. Meanwhile, the porn industry exploits all these women and men, paying them only a small fee once to shoot their movies and using them for decades without ever paying them any other fee. One would think a government that cares about porn actresses would try to help them and stop the exploitation. No, they actually don't care.

I can go on and on. When junior journalists receive information from the government in the form of indictments, they often believe everything the government says, that they are just there trying to punish deadly criminals in society, that they are trying to stop a dangerous guy. Meanwhile, the so-called dangerous man has not done all the atrocities others have done in terms of laws that punish ordinary people, including some based on their race, and bombs all over the world that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Of course, Trump is not a perfect man. People attack him; he also attacks people, and so do you.

But the false claim that he's the worst American to have ever lived and that now he's akin to Adolf Hitler and if he's re-elected again, doom and gloom would envelop the United States are simply false. Now they are claiming that he's so crazy he might attack Biden on stage on June 27 when they debate in Atlanta next week. The hypocrisy is really disgusting.

The event featured insightful discussions with industry leaders from BOK Financial, including Garrett Guthrie, CDR, Amy Brown, Brent Lewis, and Sean Medlin. It was a fantastic opportunity to network and gain insights into the future of technology and banking.

BOK Financial is a prime example of community-driven banking, with a strong focus on local initiatives in Tulsa. The speakers discussed various innovative projects, emphasizing their commitment to consumer and mobile web development. They highlighted their efforts to introduce features that distinguish them from their competitors and shared their vision for staying modern and effective over the next 15 years. Their focus on modernizing payment processes and API integration strategies, along with their proactive approach to addressing technical debt within the software engineering team, was impressive as well. I value how they highlighted the significance of both soft and technical skills, emphasizing that it goes beyond memorization.

I'm thankful for the chance to attend a school that helps forge connections with top companies like BOK Financial in the Tulsa tech scene. Their groundbreaking work in banking technology truly inspires me, and I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about their company.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulerio/,"I am deeply pleased to share that I have graduated from the ITSMF - Information Technology Senior Management Forum Management Academy. My profound gratitude goes to Bank of America for the unwavering investment in my professional development. This support not only enhances my capabilities but also inspires me to contribute more meaningfully each day to my teammates and the community in which we live and work.

The ITSMF Management Academy offers Black IT leaders a truly transformative journey. Over the past ten months, alongside my 76 cohort members—affectionately known as the Phoenix 76—we embarked on an intense and immersive experience that underscored ITSMF's mission to transform the mind, body, and soul. Through 26 assignments, over ten book readings, executive and book presentations, leader-to-leader sessions, and monthly cohort calls, our directors, Dr Turner and Shakeer Abdullah, Ph.D. challenged us to lead ourselves first before leading others. Their dedication delivered a leadership program that was both rigorous and methodical, transforming us from the inside out. One particularly impactful aspect was the unfiltered feedback, which was both constructive and compassionate.

To cap it off, I was humbled to receive the ITSMF Global Citizenship Award. This honor fuels my resolve and inspires me to continue showing up selflessly for those around me.

I would like to honor a few individuals who made this experience unforgettable:

• My leader, Terrelle Carswell has been my staunch advocate throughout this journey. His support, advocacy, and encouragement have been invaluable.

• My accountability partner in the program, Zena Kyles, MBA, PMP, epitomizes strength and resolve. She taught me to put aside excuses and simply show up.

• My executive mentor, Tonya Bryant, challenged me to aim high. Her encouragement to continually pursue growth and learning was invaluable.

To my Phoenix 76 family: Our ten-month metamorphosis required us to trust the process. We finished strong because we learned to humbly sharpen each other to excel and thrive. Our journey to the elevated altitude didn't leave us gasping for air; instead, we learned to release our burdens and blind spots so we could soar like the Phoenix. As we've reached this mountainous milestone, remember, we were not meant to stay at the top. The real work is just beginning.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,"Watching a recent ONC Certification program roundtable and realizing how directly the ONC targeted Epic/Abridge with the way they tailored ""Decision support interventions"" (§170.315(b)(11)) in the HTI-1 final rule.

As a reminder, Abridge is part of Epic's Vendor Services program, but specifically an elite tier (Workshop). This is reserved for:
1. Apps building something Epic does not want to build, but wants to be able to be leading in (this applies to both Toolbox and Workshop tiers)
2. Apps that Epic has chosen to codevelop the cutting edge APIs and UX to accomplish those workflows (this applies to just Workshop)

""Decision support interventions"" is intended to replace an existing criteria ""clinical decision support"" (§ 170.315(a)(9)) to introduce information transparency to address uncertainty regarding the quality of predictive DSIs. The criteria requires surfacing ""source attributes"" about AI algorithms. This is an important and valuable criteria, but it is burdensome - AI is not great at sourcing, as we've seen in the news.

What's interesting is the proposed rule, this criterion applied to ""developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface with predictive DSIs"". That's a broad range - any interfaced DSI would be somewhat looped into providing these source attributes.

In the final rule, the scope of impacted Predictive DSIs was narrowed to  ""supplied by a developer of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module ""

In the webinar, it seems that language was intended to loop in Abridge and Epic:

Audience member: ""The first one here is going with the NES analogy if both Game cartridges can be seen in the Nintendo store, does that imply ""stewardship""? Both games can integrate with the NES APIs and Nintendo wants to show that availability is possible but only one game was developed collaboratively""
Jeff Smith (ONC): ""The answer to the question is that the kind of source attribute and intervention risk management requirements would only pertain to the game that was developed collaboratively. We know several developers have App Stores but we don't consider predictive DSIs that are offered through the App Store ""supplied by"" unless the developer themselves have gone to promote a specific predictive DSI that they have collaboratively worked with... simply listing a predictive DSI in a developer's App Store does not mean that that predictive DSi is necessarily supplied by developer so just being in the App
Store isn't a determinative quality.""

Being an EHR partner is a significant tailwind, for sure, but with that comes a required regulatory burden that competitive ambient/AI solutions are not regulated by. This is good news for ambient/AI startups trying to ""fast follow"" - they're hypothetically able to use the APIs Abridge and Epic create, but don't necessarily have to implement the sourcing. I wonder if health systems demand DSI for all their AI solutions, though.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,MISC,,Article,Matt ,Kamen,Optum Inc.,Healthcare Providers,Chief Strategy & Analytics Officer,2024-07-01 17:44,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7210103330537119744,,,,,,54,15,0,1w,,,https://youtu.be/k6tjJZj98LA?t=3281,Matt Kamen liked Alya Sulaiman’s comment on this,,,2024-06-22 02:16,,,,,,,,,Saturday,6:16 AM,6/22/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitanjali-joshi-76107595/,"This is a powerful lesson in confidence and grace from my ten-year-old.

A lot of times we learn something from our children and this is one of them. My ten year old daughter at school was told that “you are ugly” by a girl leading a group of other girls.

I was upset and broken down for a second with lot of thoughts hitting my head until she continued her remaining conversation…

My girl instantly responded that yes “I’m trying to look like you today“ and the other girl got mad and said that “I can’t stand you anymore” And my girl said “then please sit down”.

As a parent it hurts me still writing about it and at the same time I’m proud that my daughter chose to be kind, confident and resilient to harsh words.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandy-brown-03b6277/,"As a founder, I often get asked – how did you come up with your company name?   While I typically use this to crack some dumb dad-joke, the reality is the name will find you.

When we named XUP (pronounced ‘zup’), it was after whiteboarding up a thousand plus names, multiple languages and meanings…but what really happened is someone was being funny and then an unfortunate spelling mistake that led to the name. Eventually, we came up with the ‘public’ story which was the “X” stood for transactions and we drive them UP! So XUP!

Now that we’re on to pAIwares (pronounced pay-wares), it was MUCH easier. We knew AI was going to be on the platform, we were software and in payments…so after a few URL availability searches, pAIwares.com was available and it stuck. Okay, we had one teammate who didn’t like it, but he eventually came around.

Some say naming your company is exciting while others say it’s daunting. Either way, pick one that you can get behind with an available URL, and don’t be afraid of people not pronouncing it correctly. As long as they’re calling you something close, you’re in the game.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-perry-8562347/,"Looking back at her teenaged self when she had been recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Emily Browne she says she was the direct beneficiary of the advances St. Jude has made in methotrexate pharmacodynamics and the pursuit to replace cranial radiation with intrathecal therapy. Now two decades into her career at St. Jude and nearly 29 years since her diagnosis, Browne shares her story in honor of National Cancer Survivors Day. 

“I didn’t know it then, but my journey to St. Jude began September 11, 1995, when I was diagnosed,” she says. “As a 17-year-old, I didn’t know what “oncology” meant, only that my pediatrician was concerned about my lab results and persistent fever. I found myself in a clinic in my hometown of Birmingham surrounded by children with cancer, oblivious to the fact that I was about to become one of them.” 

Fast forward and Browne began in a dream job in a clinic at St. Jude. It was then she began to understand and appreciate the enormous impact that St. Jude researchers like Dr. Ching-Hong Pui and countless others had on advancing the cure rates and improving the quality of life of all children with cancer, including herself. Over the past 20 years, she has worked in a variety of capacities at Jude – from Leukemia & Lymphoma to nursing, and now the Transition Oncology Program.  As director of the fledgling program, Browne offers her perspective, knowledge and experience to better understand the psychosocial and physical health needs of patients and families as they transition off cancer-directed therapy and for the next few years of early survivorship. 

“It’s been amazing to experience different career paths without ever leaving St. Jude,” she says, “I can’t imagine working anywhere else!”

https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-perry-8562347/,"Looking back at her teenaged self when she had been recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Emily Browne she says she was the direct beneficiary of the advances St. Jude has made in methotrexate pharmacodynamics and the pursuit to replace cranial radiation with intrathecal therapy. Now two decades into her career at St. Jude and nearly 29 years since her diagnosis, Browne shares her story in honor of National Cancer Survivors Day. 

“I didn’t know it then, but my journey to St. Jude began September 11, 1995, when I was diagnosed,” she says. “As a 17-year-old, I didn’t know what “oncology” meant, only that my pediatrician was concerned about my lab results and persistent fever. I found myself in a clinic in my hometown of Birmingham surrounded by children with cancer, oblivious to the fact that I was about to become one of them.” 

Fast forward and Browne began in a dream job in a clinic at St. Jude. It was then she began to understand and appreciate the enormous impact that St. Jude researchers like Dr. Ching-Hong Pui and countless others had on advancing the cure rates and improving the quality of life of all children with cancer, including herself. Over the past 20 years, she has worked in a variety of capacities at Jude – from Leukemia & Lymphoma to nursing, and now the Transition Oncology Program.  As director of the fledgling program, Browne offers her perspective, knowledge and experience to better understand the psychosocial and physical health needs of patients and families as they transition off cancer-directed therapy and for the next few years of early survivorship. 

“It’s been amazing to experience different career paths without ever leaving St. Jude,” she says, “I can’t imagine working anywhere else!”

We are so proud to announce David McFadyen, MBA, FACHE as the new president and chief executive officer of Trinity Health, West Region.

David has been a leading voice in the Treasure Valley’s healthcare landscape for nearly 20 years, and since 2020, he has served as the President of Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center where his leadership, commitment to civic engagement, and community service have helped bring mission-driven growth to our colleagues, providers, and patients.

“I look forward to continuing the legacy that Odette Bolano has paved for the Idaho, Oregon and California region,"" David shared today. 

""Over the last four years, we have navigated through a global pandemic, endured the post-pandemic aftershock and despite this, have refined fiscal and operational efficiencies, and developed our service lines to reach extraordinary levels. 
With this solid foundation, I look forward to continuing to work with our medical staff, leaders, and colleagues to continue transforming healthcare, keeping quality health care local, and making it accessible for our communities.”

David will begin his new role on July 1st and looks forward to building on the health system’s legacy of compassionate, transformative health care.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretthuselton/,"The past 13 months at Flatiron Health has been amazing. Even after 25 years in the industry, I learned a ton and have met and collaborated with some amazing folks here.” Although it has been a joy creating and driving the Scientific Engagement team at Flatiron, I have chosen to step away at this time. There are a handful of factors, but the driving decision was a combination of some parental health issues that I’d like to actively help support through the next few months (hopefully to stabilization) and the fact that it aligned with some strategic Flatiron objectives in their timeline. What I’m really going to miss most is the day-to-day work with Eric Meadows Jenna Collins Craig Serra and Kristi M. Zimmerman Savill, but it’s a small world and I have a feeling we’ll all cross paths again. I also want to especially thank Javier Jimenez and Stephanie Reisinger for bringing me into the Flatiron team - this was a tremendous experience. I also want to thank the Executive team, and especially Nathan Hubbard, for allowing me to help shape the Flatiron scientific structure and ensuring that all these critical decisions supported Flatiron’s optimal path forward. 

I plan to take the month or two off from full-time Epidemiology work and instead, roll up my sleeves to provide some caregiving to my parents and hopefully also give my kids more of my time than they probably even want this summer and helping to develop some good core memories. 

In a perfect world, I will be looking to jump back into full-time work by mid/late August (hopefully in time to attend ISPE) and I’m absolutely open to discussion on what that work might be (epidemiology, data strategy, drug safety, CSO, etc.) as I do not have anything definitely lined up for my next role.

If you have any ideas or want to talk about how I may be able to help you/your organization, I'm all ears.

This transition has been a time for me to reflect on my journey and be grateful for the opportunities and relationships I have had on my way!

The camaraderie I've received from my colleagues has been instrumental in my professional and personal development. Together, we have navigated challenges, celebrated successes, and continually strived to provide the highest quality of care to our patients. 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to every team member, colleague and friend I've had the privilege of working with. Your collaboration, and encouragement have made me a better clinician, leader and person.

As I embark on this new chapter, I carry with me the lessons learned and the friendships formed at St Joseph Medical Center and VMFH. While leaving is bittersweet, I am excited for what the future holds and confident that the foundation built here will continue to support my growth.

I look forward to staying connected and cheering on your continued success from afar.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaretdowns8/,"Recently, I sat down to talk with lots of women about their financial journey and many of the conversations led to what they wished they would have known sooner. 

Reflecting on my own financial journey, I realize now how much small changes can make a huge difference. It's something I wish I had known sooner! From not saving early enough to feeling too embarrassed to ask questions, these are common regrets I've heard from so many women.

In my latest blog post, I share insights from my own experiences and interviews with amazing women. Whether it's understanding tax-deferred savings, leveraging work benefits, or just getting more involved in your finances, there's always room for improvement.

Here's the full blog post with some ideas on how to move forward to start making better decisions today:

I’m overwhelmed by all the heartfelt messages, phone calls, and kindness from friends and colleagues, as well as the lamenting by patients at the loss of the Walmart Health Care Access Point.

Since we announced the closure of Walmart Health, I’ve sat down many times to write my thoughts.

Yesterday, some of my team spent time together in person for likely the last time. Through all the noise, the core message is clear. This is how I will remember Walmart Health: the patients we served, the impact we had in our communities, the vision of what nationally scalable, accessible, and high-quality healthcare could look like, the incredible talent brought to bear, and the lasting friendships.

From truck drivers and manufacturing employees, to store associates and hospitality workers, deskless workers make up 80% of our global workforce and face high rates of mental illness, yet have remarkably poor access to care.

🌀 Research shows that mistreatment by customers — something that 62% of restaurant employees experienced in 2021 alone — drives burn out and leads to mental illness.
🌀 BIPOC make up 40% of retail workers — but our country’s therapist population can only support 1.7% of people of color in America.

And yet, the availability of mental health benefits is far rarer for deskless workers—and even when mental health benefits are available to deskless workers, they completely miss the mark, failing to support the unique needs, schedules and culture of deskless employees.

Join us this June to talk through how we can solve the problem together ✨ Register here: https://lnkd.in/gAZtcEeW",https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-carmouche-md/,MISC,,Image,David,Carmouche,Walmart Health and Wellness,Healthcare Providers,SVP Healthcare Delivery,2024-07-02 15:20,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206389396823056386,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQHKfNv5go8aJQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1719192486009?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=H155q9Do_pWatn-axpc1OW4kEoe2-u50x1l5DZs4jnE,,,,,36,5,2,3w,,,,"David Carmouche, MD likes this",,,2024-06-11 16:18,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,8:18 PM,6/11/2024,,,,,,,,,

My goal has always been to make a real difference in at least one person's life each and every day.


To dream the impossible dream
 To fight the unbeatable foe
 To bear with unbearable sorrow
 To run where the brave dare not go
 
 To right the unrightable wrong
 To try when your arms are too weary
 To reach the unreachable star
 
 This is my quest, to follow that star
 No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
 To be willing to march into Hell for a Heavenly cause.
 
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest
 
 And the world will be better for this
 That one man, scorned and covered with scars
 Still strove with his last ounce of courage
 To reach the unreachable star

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel🥴. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 💗
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracyburzycki/,"When our daughter Mrinalini was born, we decided to raise her in India during her school years. 

Once when she was six, we were at Delhi airport waiting to board. I noticed her speaking in a whispered voice, concentrating intensely, eyes closed. I asked her later what she'd been up to. She became shy. ""Papa, I was sending a message to my school teacher.""

""If you cannot write a letter,  there is another way to send a thought over. You send it to God who then sends it across to the person. I wanted her to know that I love her and am looking forward to seeing her again in school soon.""

When she was seven, we enrolled her in a summer athletics cubs camp at Columbia. Walking around campus, seeing the statue of Columbia’s beloved mascot, the lion, she announced, “I will go to college here when I grow up.” 

I smiled. “Mrinalini, let time take its course. There are many good colleges, and I am sure one of them is going to be just the right one for you.” Who could say what the future held in store?

She frowned fiercely, as if to tell me, just because I am seven and you’re a bit older does not mean that you don’t take what I know about my destiny seriously.

When she was nine, I noticed her getting very stretched across multiple projects. I thought it was time to sit her down and offer her some adult wisdom. “Mrinalini, as you grow, you’ll see that you can’t do everything, or learn everything, or be everything. You’ll have to make some hard choices.”

“Leonardo de Vinci didn’t have to make hard choices,” she replied.

Never swaying for a moment in her plan for college, 8 years later, she got early admission to Columbia. 

Then last week, Mrinalini Sisodia Wadhwa graduated. As Columbia College’s Salutatorian, she was given the honor of sitting next to the College Dean on stage. She double-majored in history and mathematics & won departmental honors in both fields & a history thesis award. At Columbia, she learned French, Sanskrit and Urdu, was the co-editor-in-chief of the Columbia Undergraduate Law Journal and chair of the Columbia History Association, and co-founded the Columbia Asia Journal. She will now study as a US Rhodes Scholar at University of Oxford. 

At her graduation dinner, I shared her passion for art and poetry. The way she used two corks and three toothpicks to make a giraffe when she was seven, and a poem she wrote on Africa when she was sixteen at a Bostwana safari. I should have also shared her love for knitting, and Odissi, and her daily meditation.

Every child has the seed of something magical in them. All we can do, as parents and caregivers, is to water that seedling and watch it bloom into the radiant flower they were each uniquely meant to be. Because, as India’s poet laureate Tagore wrote, “Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man.”

Congratulations to the Class of 2024 around the world, and a big ""thank you"" to all school and college educators!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonwarner3/,"Thrilled to share that I am now cancer-free and on a slow and steady road to recovery. 💜 💪 

A few months ago, a preventative MRI revealed a rare tumor on my pancreas (solid pseudopapillary neoplasm). Thanks to early detection, we acted quickly before it spread, removing just 25% of my pancreas while largely preserving my spleen and other vital organs.  The tests are back, and the cancer is gone.

Key learnings from this journey:

🔹 Proactive Health: Early detection can save lives, and in my case, it did. My cancer was found through a preventative MRI. I had no signs or symptoms of cancer, in fact I was the healthiest I'd been in years.
🔹Self-Advocacy: If you're unsatisfied with your healthcare provider, seek a second opinion at another institution.  Advocate for yourself, even when it feels deeply uncomfortable.
🔹 Empathy: You never know what someone is going through. Be kind and supportive, as they may be putting on a brave face. 
🔹 Gratitude: Immense thanks to Biograph's diligent team for the early detection, my employer and team at OpenAI for their unwavering support, my all star husband Connor O'Brien, and our friends, family, and community for standing by our family through this. Special thanks to the world-class team at Stanford University for their exceptional care through every step of my journey. Truly the best healthcare institution in the world.

Looking forward, I'm increasingly optimistic about the future of healthcare, especially with AI's potential. Numerous promising AI companies in healthcare are emerging, and I'm excited to support their growth through any way possible. I believe that AI will revolutionize healthcare, making early detection and effective treatment more accessible.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement. This experience has strengthened my resolve to live fully and prioritize health, wellness, and family. 💜",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonwarner3/,MISC,,Text,Jason,Warner,Francisco Partners,Private Equity,"Managing Director, Data Science",2024-07-02 15:24,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211146093244370945,,,,,,6438,251,3,1w,,,,"Jason Warner, CFA likes this",,,2024-06-24 19:20,,,,,,,,,Monday,11:20 PM,6/24/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamblaketiemeyer/,"“Professionalism” is often used to sideline LGBTQ people.

“I hear from a lot of trans and gender nonconforming people, dress code is often used as a smokescreen to justify homophobia and transphobia,"" says artist and public speaker ALOK Vaid-Menon.

“There’s still this idea that our appearance is conflated with our legitimacy...with our ability to do a good job,"" ALOK says. ""We need to disentangle that.""

ALOK says that often queer or trans people are penalized or punished for being ""visibility emotional, visibly queer, visibly trans in the workplace."" They say, don't underestimate that, but also don't underestimate the power of queer and trans leadership in the workplace.

""It begins with an individual saying, 'I’m not going to tolerate this,' and recognizing that creates ramifications and reverberations for all people.""

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-ryan-0788b239,"Yesterday at the NYSE, we commemorated the 25th Anniversary of Goldman Sachs’ initial public offering. Joined by many of the original IPO team members, we had the honor of celebrating this pivotal moment in our firm’s history by recreating the bell ringing from 1999. 

As part of the celebration, I hosted a dinner with former chairman and CEO Hank Paulson for an audience of IPO alumni, leadership, and others who have been essential to the firm’s success over the years. Hank had an incredible journey – beginning as an investment banker, rising to partner, and ultimately leading the firm’s transition into a publicly traded company in 1999. Under Hank’s guidance, Goldman Sachs navigated the IPO and expanded our global footprint, all while preserving our unique culture and partnership ethos.

Hank put it best: ""We would not be Goldman Sachs if we didn't go public because you can't be Goldman Sachs unless you're dealing with the most important clients and markets, and that takes people and capital."" Thank you to Hank and all alumni for your vision and the extraordinary standard you set. Commemorating this milestone with you.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-ryan-0788b239,MISC,,Image,Ben,Ryan,Goldman Sachs,Private Equity,Global Head Of Digital Workplace Product Management,2024-07-02 15:29,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207734875582271488,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQFPoxjjjU0Qbw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718376824299?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=_HcEl75Iy3IYXGIgPC4tmJ-24NiGfMYvrDEMsXs-O4A,,,,,2878,46,32,2w,,,,Ben Ryan likes this,,,2024-06-15 09:25,,,,,,,,,Saturday,1:25 PM,6/15/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"2x Oscar winner Ben Proudfoot x Laura D at Cannes. Ben Proudfoot is debuting two short films at Cannes - L’Oreal and LinkedIn. 

Storytelling has always been the foundation of creativity in advertising. 

Short film is showing the way for short form video which is growing exponentially versus display online. 

As social x entertainment convergence increases it is likely Netflix and Facebook or Instagram will look more like each other.  A platform where people can go to connect, discover, buy and be entertained all in one experience. This is something brands and agencies need to consider thoughtfully. 

What is Ben’s approach to storytelling in short form film and how has this led to two back to back Academy Awards?

What role does short film play in a brand’s messaging and content strategy in the future?

 ️
The energy and passion of the fans were undeniable. Even with rain and chilly temps, we shattered the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) attendance record – a true testament to the incredible Chicago sports and soccer community!

This wasn't just about the game; it was about seeing young fans cheering for their heroes, experiencing the magic of Wrigley Field for the first time. 
It was about the pre-game energy at Gallagher Way, the shared passion of friends, colleagues, and the entire league.

Huge shoutout to Laura Ricketts and Karen Leetzow for their vision and hustle in making this historic event happen in just under two months! And of course to the incredible National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) with a special shout to Julie Haddon & Jessica Berman. And major props to the Red Stars staff who tirelessly worked behind the scenes to ensure a smooth night.

This is a night women's soccer and women's sports in general won't soon forget. #ChicagoRedStars #NWSL #HistoryMade

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"Yesterday, the Chicago Red Stars hosted a Women’s Sports Panel at Wrigley Field on the Business of Women’s Sports and investing in women & the amazing professional athletes across the Pro Sports Landscape.

I am proud to be an investor in the Chicago Red Stars, and see Owner, Laura Ricketts & Team President, Karen Leetzow do amazing and inspiring things to lead this team to great heights.

Here are a few inspiring quotes from yesterday’s panel:

“It’s up to us by purpose  to invest in Women’s Sports and shine a light on what women can do.” Laura Ricketts 

“A big difference I see in terms of investing in women’s sports, is how social media and streaming showed the data that viewership, engagement and interest was there in the women’s game.  This was a big shift and compelled investors and media companies to take a fresh look”.   Ally Wagner (Bay FC Founder & former USWNT Soccer Player).

“We have the platform to bring women’s sports to every HH in the US.  We think Women’s sports is a great business and we want to lead the media industry in championing it…..part of the problem is there is audience for the games but you can’t find enough of the product on air…..we’re going to change”. Brian Lawlor (President Scripps Sports)

So - if you are in the Chicago Area, come watch history as the Chicago Red Stars take on Bay FC.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Lions is a wrap, and Smartly came to play. Here's a glimpse into our week of sparking industry love and creative revolution, anchored by our campaign of Falling back in love with advertising again:

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdco’s platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = ❤️: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Global Thought Leaders: From global creative leaders Rob Reilly, Alexandre Abrantes, Jo Shoesmith, Claudine Cheever, Chaka Sobhani, to storytellers like Double Oscar Winner Ben Proudfoot, we hosted insightful talks that challenged the status quo and ignited a passion for innovation.

The Business of Women’s Sports Take Center Stage: We spotlighted the booming business of women's sports with two powerful panels including Thayer Lavielle, Heather Hopkins Freeland, Flaujae Johnson, Angela Ruggiero, Jessica Berman, Meg Linehan. Smartly sits at the heart of the social & streaming channels driving this growth. #InvestInHer

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Lions is a wrap, and Smartly came to play. Here's a glimpse into our week of sparking industry love and creative revolution, anchored by our campaign of Falling back in love with advertising again:

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdco’s platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = ❤️: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Global Thought Leaders: From global creative leaders Rob Reilly, Alexandre Abrantes, Jo Shoesmith, Claudine Cheever, Chaka Sobhani, to storytellers like Double Oscar Winner Ben Proudfoot, we hosted insightful talks that challenged the status quo and ignited a passion for innovation.

The Business of Women’s Sports Take Center Stage: We spotlighted the booming business of women's sports with two powerful panels including Thayer Lavielle, Heather Hopkins Freeland, Flaujae Johnson, Angela Ruggiero, Jessica Berman, Meg Linehan. Smartly sits at the heart of the social & streaming channels driving this growth. #InvestInHer

Leaving Cannes, we're energized to lead the charge towards a future where intelligent creative fuels brand love and growth. The best is yet to come! #SmartlyatCannes2024 #CannesLions2024

Had an incredible 360 discussion from the lens of athlete, investment, brand and talent management about women's sports as the next big play 🏆 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity

""The next generation isn't going to be thinking ""men's sports/ women's sports - they're thinking sports"" Heather Hopkins Freeland, Adobe

""By 2050, I think women's sports will eclipse men's sports. The market doesn't meet the value right now. There is pent up demand, and the market needs to adjust. Sports is a great investment, but women and athlete-led in particular, is going to continue to push the industry"" Angela Ruggiero Sports Innovation Lab

""Business is business, but when you have good people, business can be personal. And that builds security and trust with the athlete. When I choose a deal, it's about deciding if a brand really cares. "" Flaujae Johnson

Early morning session with social tech leader Smartly with one of my mentors in the industry Laura Desmond.  Women’s sports is the next big play.  “Growth and business behind women’s sports is worthy of more supply,  more audiences and fandom.”

We are at an inflection point. Hey brands what gets funded gets attention.  This is a smart business play that both Eli Lilly and Company and Adobe have noticed. 

Incredible panel. As a Canadian I can only hope we replicate some of this momentum up north.

Inspiring conversation at the Smartly Penthouse about the role of Brands on the Women's sports rocketship:
""Brands aren't just doing it to check a box or to be popular. It's to build business. If you can show that it can be a thriving profitable growing business, then you just through some barriers that are incredibly important for society. Brands and partners who get that are special.""

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Lions is a wrap, and Smartly came to play. Here's a glimpse into our week of sparking industry love and creative revolution, anchored by our campaign of Falling back in love with advertising again:

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdco’s platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = ❤️: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Global Thought Leaders: From global creative leaders Rob Reilly, Alexandre Abrantes, Jo Shoesmith, Claudine Cheever, Chaka Sobhani, to storytellers like Double Oscar Winner Ben Proudfoot, we hosted insightful talks that challenged the status quo and ignited a passion for innovation.

The Business of Women’s Sports Take Center Stage: We spotlighted the booming business of women's sports with two powerful panels including Thayer Lavielle, Heather Hopkins Freeland, Flaujae Johnson, Angela Ruggiero, Jessica Berman, Meg Linehan. Smartly sits at the heart of the social & streaming channels driving this growth. #InvestInHer

Leaving Cannes, we're energized to lead the charge towards a future where intelligent creative fuels brand love and growth. The best is yet to come! #SmartlyatCannes2024 #CannesLions2024

But that ""is absolutely not true,"" said Klarna's Megan Gokey. And it's costing the companies that make and sell merch — as well as teams and leagues — as much as $4 billion a year, according to a new data analysis by Klarna and the Sports Innovation Lab released Wednesday.

In addition to calculating the value of the largely untapped market, a study from the Sports Innovation Lab found 60% of women’s sports fans have wanted to buy merchandise but couldn’t because of a lack of inventory.

“There's a big market here and, like everything else in women's sports, it has been underserved, misunderstood and there's things we can do to fix it very easily,” Angela Ruggiero, the Hall of Fame ice hockey player who is co-founder of Sports Innovation Lab, told USA TODAY Sports.

I would go into rooms and I look different…I’d say things that are different…and I didn’t really fit in with the rest of the group…
 
Perhaps I have gotten used to it, because it’s 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐦𝐞.
 
But that takes a level of confidence that I have to bring with me every time I walk into the room…a confidence I got from those who #invested in me.
 
I wouldn’t be where I am in my #career without the people who believed in me…who were willing to accept me…
 
And willing to see my potential.
 
A profession like ours shouldn’t be limited to people who look the same…sound the same…and come from the same background. 
 
It’s quite simply bad #business.
 
We need Wall Street to start removing their own limits…and take a look at people they wouldn’t have considered in the past.

She discusses the ""why"" behind her highly collaborative and cross-functional approach to partnering with prospective clients, touches on why she was drawn to Canoe, and explains how she finds inspiration through her family, travel, and giving back.

""We truly have amazing people who work at Canoe, and I try to showcase that to the prospect. They are not just signing up for incredible tech but will be working with a partner to help grow their alternative business in the future,"" said Megale.

""When a prospect or client shares new functionality they are looking for, that is something our Product team is constantly working on. Having previously worked at larger corporations, seeing how quickly we can turn around an idea or feature has been exciting and refreshing.""

https://www.linkedin.com/in/angie-wyatt-b0869491/,"👏 Standing ovation for the first 100% renewable energy company in Colombia! 

In their recently published sustainability report, AES Colombia outlined plans to triple its installed renewable capacity by 2030, reaching 3000 MW. The great team led by the visionary Federico Echavarria is working on an impressive pipeline of solar, wind and energy storage projects that will triple our renewable portfolio in Colombia. 

With a goal of carbon neutrality by 2025, AES Colombia is a true leader in sustainability. This ambitious goal will become possible thanks to the dedication and professionalism of the team, who is constantly expanding the boundaries of innovation, offering the cleaner and greener energy solutions our customers need. 

At The AES Corporation, we are proud to be strategic allies in Colombia's energy transition, enabling our customers in the country achieving the decarbonization of their energy matrix. In 2023 our solar parks in Colombia generated nearly 150,000 MWh of renewable energy and contributed to the reduction of 54,000 tons of carbon dioxide. 

This way we are also supporting the country's commitments in the 2030 Agenda of reducing carbon emissions by 51% and the 2050 Agenda of achieving carbon neutrality. 

Endless applause to the great AES Colombia team for accelerating the future of energy, together! 🌎

There, Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics, explained that, in a world where uncertainty and complexity prevail, it is crucial to approach predictions with humility. As Daniel Kahneman wrote in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, ""A plan for the future is an act of faith that cannot be based on certainty."" Recognizing the limitations of our own knowledge and understanding can prevent us from falling victim to overconfidence and bias, allowing for more accurate and nuanced predictions. By maintaining a humble attitude towards our predictive abilities and leading with curiosity, we open ourselves up to learning from mistakes and adjusting our strategies accordingly. Ultimately, humility in prediction-making is not a sign of weakness, but rather a strength that leads to more thoughtful and insightful decision-making.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,"My first experience with the devastating effects of climate change was the Cedar Rapids Flood of 2008. Almost 10% of the people in my hometown were displaced from their homes, and this flood caused 7x more damage because of climate change. 

Since then, it’s been my goal to contribute to the fight against climate change. Today, we have the chance to reduce suffering on a global scale, by acting now to minimize our greenhouse gas emissions.

This mission has taken me through the University of Iowa and University of California, Berkeley, where I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to begin tackling this immense challenge. During my PhD at Berkeley, my team at Berkeley Lab and I identified heavy industry as one of the most difficult sources of emissions to tackle, with huge potential for positive impact. 

During the next several years, we explored what it would take to decarbonize industrial process heat, which makes up 1/4 of all energy used in the world and accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions. We designed a thermal storage material and system that could provide this industrial heat at prices competitive with fossil fuels, and proved many of the critical features of this technology on a lab scale!

Our results were so promising that I decided to begin looking into what it would take to commercialize this, and bring the technology into the real world. This brought me to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Cradle to Commerce program, where I met Pauliina Meskanen.

Very quickly after meeting Pauliina, I knew this was somebody I wanted to work with. She has the determination, motivation, skills, and personality required to build a successful company from the ground up, and we decided to start working together almost exactly a year ago.

From these initial conversations, Calectra was born! Pauliina and I founded Calectra together with the mission to electrify and decarbonize industrial process heat. Since last May, we’ve found that high-temperature industry (steel, cement, glass, chemicals, aluminum) is especially lacking in solutions for decarbonization. We are full steam ahead on filling this gap!

We’ve got big plans, please follow along as we work to build Calectra and change the world!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,MISC,,Image,Ravi,Prasher,Bloom Energy,Utilities,Chief Technology Officer,2024-07-02 15:39,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211774471374786560,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D22AQFwP8yErsKuoQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1719418403430?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=drPGvQ8h9JhnzxGVjGoDtPaC48QJG8eSzosbEOUdcak,,,,,107,29,3,6d,Congratulations!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,"Yesterday, at the age of 105, Virginia “Ginger” Hislop graduated from Stanford University Graduate School of Education with her master’s degree. When she started on campus in 1936, her plan was to get her bachelor’s of education, which she did in 1940, and obtain her master’s of education so she could teach, which she started directly after. 

However, just after completing her coursework and before turning in her final thesis, her then-boyfriend George Hislop, ’41, a GSE student in Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), got called in to serve during World War II, prompting the pair to get married and Virginia Hislop to leave campus before graduating. 

Now – 83 years after leaving campus and living in service to learning – Virginia Hislop returned to Stanford to finish what she started and receive her graduate degree. When she rose from her seat at the ceremony, donned in cap and gown, to walk across the stage and receive her master’s hood, the applause roared. She was handed her diploma and smiled for the cameras. Her grandkids waved and cheered. 

“My goodness,” she said. “I’ve waited a long time for this.”

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,"Corrosion of alloys in high temperature molten salts is often considered from the point of view of the alloy. A relatively less studied aspect, however, is the influence of the corrosion on the ""fouling"" of the molten salts themselves. In his recent publication (https://lnkd.in/eNnkyyv2), Kondaiah Paruchuri explores this subject in detail for molten nitrate, carbonate and chloride salts and shows that the corrosion resistant coatings developed at the Advanced Materials and Technologies Laboratory (https://amtl.me.vt.edu) not just mitigate corrosion of the alloys at high temperature but also reduce fouling, thereby preserving the properties of the molten salts better for thermal energy capture and storage.

During the experience, Jack and Jill Dads attended the NASCAR races throughout the entire weekend at Charlotte Motor Speedway, including the Coca-Cola 600 from a suite, as well as met notable NASCAR figures such as Max and Jennifer Siegel, owners of Rev Racing – the competition arm for NASCAR’s Drive for Diversity program; NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series driver Rajah Caruth and his father Roger; and Phil Horton, Rev Racing’s Director of Athletic Performance. They also listened to panels of NASCAR professionals. 

Even some of our moms and teens came to enjoy the fun! 

National Corresponding Secretary Nichelle Nicholes Levy is currently senior assistant general counsel of digital and privacy data for NASCAR Media Ventures. 

NASCAR Chief Human Resources Officer John Ferguson is also a Jack and Jill Father. 

A special thanks to them, as well as our National Father’s Auxiliary, for their leadership in getting our JJ Fathers involved in the NASCAR Experience!

I also want to share a proud dad moment! My oldest daughter Charleston O’Donnell attended her first Sapphire. She's studying communications and studio art with a marketing focus at Rollins College near Orlando. Charlee said the experience was overwhelming at first but also eye-opening to see all the cool technology (anyone visit the Central Showcase??) and so many companies that support SAP. She also shared that she learned a lot from her new friends at Ascend Source – Courtney Byrd Lauren Reinhertz Paige Mendoza Reese Durow Jack Burke Carrie Lage Erwin Pong.

This program is specifically designed to support women who have experienced trauma to help them heal and move forward in their lives. Trauma can have a profound impact on a person's life, and it is essential to confront and address it in order to overcome its effects.

I am incredibly proud to share that twelve courageous women successfully completed the program and shared their powerful stories during the graduation ceremony. It was truly inspiring to witness their strength and resilience.

I was also privileged to have my dear friend, Retired Federal Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore, as our guest speaker. Her speech was nothing short of amazing, filled with valuable lessons and words of encouragement. Her presence added an extra layer of significance to the event.

Reflecting on this journey, I am overwhelmed with gratitude.

I shared my thoughts on how culture is the essence of how we operate and interact within our environment. Leadership can set the vision and direction, but it's our teams that truly drive the culture forward. Cultural growth and change emerge from the collective actions, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals across all levels of the organization.

As leaders, our role is to create an environment that empowers and inspires our teams to embody the desired culture and conditions for success. By fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity, we can create a thriving workplace where employees feel valued, engaged, and motivated.
Thank you to everyone who attended and contributed to such a meaningful discussion!

It's been a while, so thank you for allowing me a moment to share some updates via a very long post. I’m eager to reconnect and hear from you as well.

Reflecting on my 25-year journey in cybersecurity, I'm grateful for the people, experiences, and milestones that have enriched my professional life. From shaping go-to-market strategies for emerging cybersecurity companies to achieving a number of strategic exits, each experience has been a blessing.

As an immigrant displaced by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the boundless opportunities in America profoundly influenced my work ethic and values. The legacy of dedication and resilience instilled by my father, who served with the US Department of Defense, and my mother's bravery which helped us escape a war torn country, continues to inspire my commitment to the cybersecurity and defense sectors.

A career highlight was my tenure at Proofpoint, where we as a team grew the company from $20 million to $1.4 billion in annual recurring revenue over 13.5 years, from early-stage to IPO, and later acquisition by Thoma Bravo. I'm thankful for the friendships forged and lessons learned.

Along the way, I developed an obsession with the US venture capital ecosystem and how it consistently generates the world's most significant companies. Starting with pre-IPO investments in Facebook and Palantir I went on to invest in and help over 100 innovative startups over the last 15 years. This path eventually led me to launch my own VC fund called Inflection Ventures in December of 2022.

At Inflection Ventures, we focus on private companies in cybersecurity, defense, and technology infrastructure, primarily looking for growth stage companies (at their point of inflection) but also supporting and advising friends in the ecosystem across all stages.

These photos are from a visit with Shield AI in Dallas, where I met with cofounder and CEO Ryan Tseng. Shield AI leads in developing AI systems for defense applications, enhancing autonomous decision-making in critical missions where GPS and communications are compromised. Their mission aligns perfectly with our goals, and represents the impactful work we support.

Please message me if you want to catch up or learn more. I'd love to hear your voice. 

I appreciate all of you and am extremely grateful to all the LPs on this journey with us!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-f-green-6041758/,"Yesterday at the Women’s Conference, I was honored to receive the SHEro award for Equity. This award is given to someone who has worked to promote and advance equity in the workplace. To be nominated and recognized by some of my peers for this has been an incredibly humbling (and surreal!) experience.

The women’s conference has been the most inspiring 2 days, and I take home with me so many kernels of wisdom for my professional and personal life. I am so honored to work alongside such thoughtful individuals, who aside from their day to day work, take on more to make the workplace and employees better. 

I think Maria Pia Tamburri said it best on day 1 of the women’s conference, when after her interview at Dominion Energy, she went home and told her husband that Dominion had good people. I echo this thought: Dominion has good people to work with and great people to know. I’m so fortunate to call so many of my colleagues my friends.

Lastly, a special shout out to my DEV Operations Support team who rallied for the occasion! I’ve never felt so celebrated by my peers and my leadership.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-leopold-35ba46170/,"When I moved back to my hometown in 2016, I found an RVA that had transformed and grown in so many positive ways. 

Upon my return, one of the first events I attended was a talk by Sports Backers' Executive Director, Jon Lugbill, about the organization’s progress and impact on the community—and I was blown away. 

Jon also shared his vision for Sportsbackers. 

He spoke eloquently about the James River – and what an asset it is for our community. 

While the accessible, clean river is a key part of the canvas that makes RVA so livable, and in the words of Jon, our “awesome active, outdoor river town,” the people of Sportsbackers help paint it to life. 

Every year, Dominion Energy RiverRock fills the James River and surrounding canal area with leaping dogs, kayaks, concerts, and more than 100,000 smiling faces. 

Each spring, SportsBackers transforms Monument Ave, filling it with runners and its median with meditators, live bands, cheering crowds, and so much more—for what I believe is the country’s fourth-largest 10K. 

They partner with companies like Markel for the #CorporateRun. 
And they fill the holiday season with the CarMax TackyLight Run and whimsy. And more: https://lnkd.in/gXVjXbgS

This spring, it was a pleasure to partner with Megan Schultz and Will Dixon from Sportsbackers—both dedicated RVA “painters”—to make the inaugural Markel Group Reunion Walk & Run happen.

I recently heard someone on a podcast about our industry say that the next generation of aspiring trailer editors needed only to hear from the young editors now working in the trailer companies because they really couldn’t relate to the editors who were cutting trailers in the 80’s.
This actually made me smile.
I am one of those editors who has been editing trailers since the early eighties and I am still cutting these days. I am also a company owner always looking for another gifted, motivated and passionate young editor dying to do what I have been blessed to do for over 40 years and join the amazing folks at Rebel.
A couple years ago, I noticed a cut that someone posted here on LinkedIn and it blew me away.
I contacted the person who had done it. He was a junior in college!
Nick Chapman interned for us the next eighteen months and I am proud to say, right after graduating is now one of our amazing editors at Rebel and kicking ass!
Recently I have been receiving amazing cuts from young editors from around the world and they were unbelieavable!
I am happy to say that next month, two high school students will be interning with us at Rebel, one coming all the way from Denmark!
So, the moral of the story is…connect with the people who actually have been doing what you aspire to do, no matter how long they have been doing it and keep showing them your cuts.
They can recognize talent and they are most likely the ones who will be able to provide the opportunity for you to join our amazing industry.
Keep cutting, explore, try crazy ideas, have fun!
Send me your cuts! I will give you feedback and help you hone your skills.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonchapman/,MISC,,Text,Jason,Chapman,Entergy,Utilities,"SVP, Chief Technology & Business Services Officer",2024-07-02 15:50,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208753751505948672,,,,,,271,44,7,2w,,,,Jason Chapman celebrates this,,,2024-06-18 04:53,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,8:53 AM,6/18/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonchapman/,"Exciting news for #SoutheastTexas 👀

To support the region's rapidly growing energy needs, Entergy Texas submitted a proposal to build two state-of-the-art natural gas power plants in Liberty and Jefferson counties. The Legend and Lone Star Power Stations will provide enough safe, reliable, and sustainable energy to power nearly 300,000 homes while bringing $2.8 billion in economic benefits to the #SETX community. More importantly—these projects are projected to save customers ~$370 million over the lifespan of each plant. 📈

The proposal for 24/7 dispatchable generation is part of our Southeast Texas Energy Plan (aka #STEPahead). The plan aims to add 40% more generation capacity to the #SETX power grid by 2028. Click the link to read what state officials and industry leaders have to say about our #STEPahead plan and our proposal to build the Legend and Lone Star Power Stations. ⭐️

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonchapman/,"Today Entergy Texas submitted its proposal to build Legend and Lone Star Power Stations - two natural gas power plants in Jefferson and Liberty counties. These 24/7 dispatchable resources will address the critical need for increased power generation capacity, support increased economic activity throughout the region, and pave the way for sustainable energy solutions that will benefit #SETX for decades to come.

These future-forward projects are projected to save customers approximately $370 million over the lifespan of the plants. These power stations are expected to be in service in 2028 and will bring a total of $2.8 billion in economic benefits to the region. Approval of the two facilities by the Public Utility Commission of Texas will increase service reliability for all customers and support large-scale economic activity in the region like Sempra Infrastructure’s Port Arthur LNG facility. The design of these plants will also enable carbon capture and hydrogen co-firing technology.

Today's filing is a critical step forward for our recently announced Southeast Texas Energy Plan, also known as #STEPahead. The strategic plan aims to add additional generation capacity to the power grid by 2028, critical transmission to get power where it’s needed, and grid-hardening projects to help Southeast Texas withstand extreme weather.

Huge thanks to The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), the Consulate General and Innovation Centre Denmark Silicon Valley, and the Climate Imperative Foundation for making this happen.

First stop: Aarhus. Two days in, what stands out the most is that ANY waste is anathema. Think energy efficiency, first, second and third. There is no ideological or political debate about this – just accepted common sense.

And yes, Denmark is also a very beautiful country where bikes rule.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilaksubrahmanian/,"Did you happen to notice a minor adjustment to the setting on your Wi-Fi thermostat last week? It’s what we call “Demand Response” in the wonky and technical energy community. On hot humid days like we’ve been having, demand on the electric grid is significant. For those signed up for our ConnectedSolutions demand response program, small adjustments are made to the thermostat for a couple of hours to reduce demand on the grid. 

Last week Amy Findlay, P.E. and her team were hard at work overseeing this choreography. The chart below shows what happened on Thursday, when along with utilities across New England, we were able to drop the peak by 300 MW during the three-hour peak energy event timeframe – equivalent to powering approximately 200,000 homes. Amy and her team are already delivering on the vision for Virtual Power Plants.

Thank you to our partners, Kate Crosby and Peter Light for having us, and for making this project a reality through their vision and leadership.

The Eversource Energy and ABRSD project team designed and built this school through the Mass Save Path 1: Net Zero and Low EUI Buildings program, with an Energy Use Intensity (EUI) goal of 23.1 – which is well below the Massachusetts school median score of 65. The Boardwalk Campus building surpassed that EUI target and has been operating for over a year at less than a third of the energy use per square foot of a typical Massachusetts school. It is a remarkable achievement, and this building can now serve as a statewide and national model for decarbonization and high-performance energy efficiency.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilaksubrahmanian/,"I had a chance to listen to Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd speaking with Ali Velshi, chief correspondent for MSNBC, on a concise podcast discussing Ember’s (a London-based think tank) recent report on clean energy. Tune in to https://lnkd.in/dvknQiDw to listen to the entire podcast.

The overall message was meant to be positive, with Velshi noting that in 2023, 30% of the electricity generated came from clean energy sources such as hydro, wind, and solar (such as our recent solar project at Northeastern University’s landmark Snell Library building which welcomes more than two million visitors per year). This is about halfway to the world’s goal of reaching 60% by 2030.

However, a concerning point that emerged from the podcast, which seemed to be overlooked by the commentators, was the 2% increase in global electricity consumption. This is a stark reminder that to limit the rise in the world's average surface temperature to no more than 1.5 degrees C; we must urgently lower energy use, not increase it.

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has identified lowering energy use through efficiency as a crucial pathway to limiting global warming. The International Energy Agency reports that energy efficiency could cut today’s energy bills in advanced countries by one-third and make up 50% of the CO2 reductions needed by 2030 to achieve global climate targets.

Let’s all do our part to leverage advanced technology to drive energy consumption down through efficiency, which will also reduce our energy bills.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilaksubrahmanian/,MISC,,Article,Tilak,Subrahamian,Eversource,Utilities,"VP, Distribued Energy Resources",2024-07-02 15:53,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204108261350916096,,,,,,27,1,2,4w,,,https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/05/09/electricity-2023-clean-energy,Tilak Subrahmanian likes this,,,2024-06-05 09:14,,,,,,,,,Wednesday,1:14 PM,6/5/2024,,,,,,,,,
https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilaksubrahmanian/,"Decades from now we’re going to be talking about Framingham, MA being the catalyst for a clean heating and cooling revolution which reduced emissions across the northeast and across the country. To quote Zeyneb Magavi, without whom this project wouldn’t be possible, “this is a pipe dream” that came to life. 

Thanks to the incredible collaboration with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, City of Framingham, Framingham Housing Authority and so many others, we made possible the first utility scale geothermal neighborhood in the United States. What does that mean? We’re now using the earth’s temperature to heat and cool an entire neighborhood which includes a fire station, commercial units, and residences. This is a landmark moment for fighting climate change at the local level. 

I’m immensely proud to have played a small part in the project alongside Nikki Bruno, William Akley, Mary-Jo Boisvert and many more at Eversource Energy.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"After 3 transformative years at Walmart, it’s time for me to welcome a new and exciting professional challenge (more on this to come!). 

I knew saying goodbye to the most talented, caring, and ambitious people I’ve had the fortune to work with wouldn’t be easy. And it got even harder when, shortly after sharing my news, we learned that the majority of the design org would be impacted by Walmart’s RTO strategy. 

In the face of sudden change, we did what came naturally — we got together over phone, zoom and chats. We spent the last few weeks connecting, strategizing, wondering, reminiscing, laughing, and shedding a few tears. Most of these folks I’ve only met in person once or twice, a fact that has little to do with the quality of our human connection, or the groundbreaking work we deliver.

One common theme out of dozens of conversations was Gratitude. Gratitude for each other, our community, our impact (the agency and influence design has had at the world’s largest retailer is unreal!). It was a special era, and I’m grateful to have been a part of it.

To my Walmart colleagues that are staying, I hope that specialness continues on in a changed but no less meaningful form. You got this. For those that are moving on, I’m rooting for you! My virtual door is always open for you.

There are more people to thank than I’m allowed to tag, so I’ll close with a special shout out to my teams. Together we scaled new heights and had a blast doing it. You are incredible and unstoppable, always!

I joined Walmart in 2015 and have had the privilege of working in both Walmart Mexico and Central America, and Walmart USA. Throughout these years, I led diverse teams across eCommerce, Digital Factory (Zona 18), and spearheaded Mexico's digital transformation. My journey continued in the USA, where I took on multiple product roles focusing on Product Strategy, Supplier Experience, Item Catalog, Inventory Flow, and Store Innovation and Automation.
 
What other company in the world can provide such a broad range of experiences and opportunities for growth? Walmart has allowed me to develop a comprehensive skill set and gain invaluable insights across different facets of retail and technology. The size of Walmart, breadth and depth of experiences I've had here are unparalleled.
 
Throughout this journey, I've met the most amazing people who have each contributed to my growth as a person and a professional. The long tenures of Walmart employees have always impressed me the most and served as a source of inspiration. Sharing the floor with colleagues who have dedicated 20, 30, or even 40 years to this company has been a profound learning experience.
 
I leave Walmart with a bittersweet feeling. It’s not easy to say goodbye to a company I love, but also excited for the new chapter ahead for my career and my family. There are too many people to thank individually, but I want to give a special shout-out to those who have been particularly impactful in my journey.

I am very excited to be able to share that after a tremendous run serving as CEO of Ava Community Energy that I will be joining Octopus Energy Group, where I will work to grow their many clean energy tentacles across North America. 

A few years ago, I started trying to better understand who the best in class, customer obsessed, clean energy companies were so that Ava could shamelessly copy their best ideas. After lots of time spent reading reports, talking to people across the industry and directly engaging the many great and fascinating companies, I came across Octopus Energy. They were doing everything I wanted to do at Ava. 

Building a brand that people really care about - in an industry where people don't know or care about the brand. Octopus has become THE most trusted brand in energy across the UK with Trustpilot scores head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. 

Scaling load flexibility to levels where it actually matters and plays a meaningful role in electricity resource planning - with over 200k EVs and more than a GW of total load under control OE operates the largest VPP in the world. 

Designing technology solutions that fix the underlying 'wiring' issues in utility/CCA operations that make delivering incredible customer service and innovative electrification solutions so difficult - the Kraken suite of products serve over 50m utility meters globally and managing over 30GWs of clean energy.

So when the opportunity presented itself to join the Octopus team and work to bring these capabilities across the pond I was really really intrigued. I also knew that the Ava team was fully ready to take over and continue to overperform. 

Now that my journey at Ava has come to an end, I am ready to take on this amazing, fun and audacious new challenge - to partner with electric utilities across North America to help them drastically scale the delivery clean, affordable and reliable electricity. 

I look forward to catching up with many of you in the very near future.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,"My friend and neighbor is going solar. I should be celebrating this, as it puts us one step closer to energy independence and giving climate change a big kick in the pants. Unfortunately, my joy is dampened somewhat by the ever-worsening business practices within our industry.

I don't work in residential solar anymore but I can humblebrag and say I know my way around the industry pretty well after 20+ years in it and even if I had to brush up on the current net metering regs... I've got a good idea how this all works. Having said that, trying to read his ""proposal"" took me an embarassing little while, largely because so much of it is complete nonsense. I still don't fully understand what my friend has signed up for (and he CERTAINLY doesn't) but here are some things I noticed.
1. The array of financing parties involved is completely absurd. On this one document, I see reference to LGCY Power, Sunrun, and Lux Power. The added bonus is that the project is apparently actually being financed by et another party, who I won't name here. None of those folks are the actual installer, who is yet another party added to the mix. Man, as a consultant, I *am* a soft cost in the solar industry but this seems ridiculous.
2. Their generation estimate is high, which doesn't surprise me (or likely any of you) but it's high by more than I would like to see (>10%) because they didn't look at shading... for a house in the woods. Sigh.
3. When I visited my friend, he had solar on the roof already but, as far as he knew, he had not yet signed a contract. I'm not even sure where to start with that but he believed the contractor had filed for a permit, so I'm still trying to understand just what my friend has done to himself on this one.
4. The system is 10-20% oversized vs. annual load and my friend is not planning any big load increases. I am sure this was done to maximize someone's incentive because it certainly is not optimal for the homeowner. Luckily, for now, Eversource's net metering rate is pretty generous but if that changes a signficant fraction of his generation may be valued below his payment to his financing company. They also are running around with laminated ""news articles"" about ISO-NE $2.4bn investment in new infrastructure and implying that will all be fully rate based to residential customers.

5. The fear-mongering sales tactics are crazy. They claim utility costs are going up 10% per year (more like 4%-7% in reality, depending on if you look over the past 20 years or past 5 years) and that in 25 years my friend is going to have a $5k+/month electric bill. This makes their 3.5% annual increase seem darn reasonable...

At the end of the day, my friend will save something by going solar... because solar is a fundamentally effective and inexpensive technology. Unfortunately, he will pay (no joke) 4x more for it than he should have and it is down to these predatory sales practices and overly complex financing structures.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,MISC,,Text,Sander,Cohan,National Grid,Utilities,"Head, Innovation",2024-07-02 15:57,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7210301131648831488,,,,,,69,30,1,1w,,,,Sander Cohan likes this,,,2024-06-22 11:22,,,,,,,,,Saturday,3:22 PM,6/22/2024,,,,,,,,,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/awaghray/,"Ahead of Father’s Day this weekend, I want to take a moment to give a shoutout to all the fathers and father figures on our CXO team. 

As a father of three boys, I often think back to something my parents used to tell me, when I was their age: “If you want to hoot with the owls, you need to be prepared to scream with the eagles!” In other words, enjoy your late nights, have some fun, but be ready to handle your responsibilities the next morning.

This lesson has stuck with me, and as I watch my boys grow into young men with their own interests and responsibilities, I see its importance even more clearly. It’s a principle that translates directly into our team culture and our success. Managing family responsibilities and professional commitments can be challenging, but it’s that challenge that makes us stronger and more effective. 

Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there.

Here are some parting thoughts after saying goodbye to Newport Beach: 

🤝 There is an undeniable, shared desire among #utilities, #cleanenergy developers, and regulators to collaborate on the critical choke points facing the #energytransition. 

One of my favorite quotes of the week came from Vistra Corp.'s Cathleen Colbert: ""I think about this like a ship. You can't just turn a ship on a dime."" 

On that front, it was great to see California ISO and California Public Utilities Commission so well-represented across the event. Big thank you to Jill Powers and Gabe Petlin for making this happen.

☀ California is a global leader in fighting #climatechange, but there's much work to be done. One of our keynote speakers, Scale Microgrids co-founder Tim Hade, made the case that ""Climate action is war, and California is Normandy."" Check out this recap of his remarks here: https://lnkd.in/eYaqyTHf

⏰ We don't have time to continue working in silos.

In 2023, $5.4 million was donated to support 344 non-profits across our service territory to support basic needs, protect the environment and enable economic opportunity. During that same time, our dedicated employees have truly gone above and beyond, contributing 2,000 hours of service at 120 events and volunteer projects across Northern and Central Illinois.

Nicor Gas’ commitment to philanthropy and volunteerism is at the heart of everything we do. Yet, it's the strength of our partnerships with organizations like the Northern Illinois Food Bank, United Way of Metro Chicago, The Salvation Army, The Morton Arboretum, Quad County Urban League and many others that amplifies our impact, weaving together a stronger, more extensive network to serve our customers and foster regional growth. 

As I reflect on the achievements highlighted in this report, I’m filled with gratitude for the hard work and generosity of our team. Nicor Gas has been serving Illinois customers for more than 160 years, and we believe that part of our corporate responsibility is to give back. The 2023 Nicor Gas Community Impact Report reflects our commitment to supporting non-profit organizations and enhancing the quality of life for our 2.3 million customers. 

I invite you to dive into our Community Impact Report and join us in celebrating these accomplishments. Together, we can make an even bigger difference.

To further this goal, and as announced in the FACTSHEET, one of the deliverables is that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in partnership with Kenya and Ghana, plans to host the second installment of the U.S.-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit (USANES) on Industry Readiness in Nairobi, Kenya, in August 2024. Recognizing the historic relationship between the United States and Kenya, USANES 2024 envisions U.S. and African policymakers, technical experts, and industry leaders convening in Nairobi to address critical issues impacting industry readiness and the future of nuclear energy on the African continent.  The Summit comprises educational workshops, stakeholder engagement sessions, and multilateral discussions on topics from financing and workforce development to supply chain preparedness.

Thrilled to announce my new role as Global VP of Sales for Basware's innovative AP Assurance solution suite!

After an incredibly rewarding 11 months leading the North American Value Advisory practice, I'm excited to take on this fresh challenge. Working under Jethro Elvin's leadership has been a privilege, and I'm grateful for the chance to dig deep into Basware's offerings and validate firsthand why they are the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation.

However, the opportunity to spearhead the global sales of AP Assurance was too compelling to pass up. This game-changing solution offers the most effective and user-friendly approach to improving working capital, which I've encountered in my experience at both SAP and Basware.
I'm truly humbled by Basware's trust and excited to collaborate with a stellar team to drive the success of AP Assurance worldwide. 

Stay tuned for exciting developments!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmccarthynyc/,"I'm shutting down my startup, RAVACAN.

5 years after I founded it.

Here are 5 lessons and reflections:

↓

1. We don't have product-market fit

- Building an enterprise-grade software is incredibly costly
- No buying intent from Direct procurement
- Procurement managers lack the authority to drive changes internally

2. Creating a new category is hard

- Manufacturing companies prefer highly customizable solutions over SAAS
- Educating the market about a new category requires significant time and resources
- Buyers can't compare and feel the risk is higher

3. Why I'm Stopping This

- We had minimal returns despite significant effort
- We cannot build what the market needs with minimal capital, and open-source solutions exist (more on this soon!)
- Manufacturers are secretive and don't share the word with their peers even when they are very happy

4. Things I Would Have Done Differently

- Targeted more dynamic niches like semiconductors or raw materials
- Engage smaller companies instead of enterprises
- Offer the product for free to get references

5. My Most Critical Learnings

- Don't build something people need, but something they want
- Better be the second best than the first (Edit: Better be challenger than pioneer)
- Use funding momentum and don't let it go away

Richard Branson said, ""The brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all."" I try to live by this every day.

On one hand, it's tough to shut down something I've poured my heart into. 
On the other hand, I feel a sense of relief and gratitude. The journey with RAVACAN has been an incredible learning experience. The lessons I've gained, the skills I've developed, and the insights I've gathered are invaluable.

While RAVACAN's chapter is closing, these experiences will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors. I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned to whatever comes next.

Thank you to my talented and tenacious teammates Benjamin BEGUIN, Carles Ballester, to our first clients who saw the future with us, especially Mike Maloney, to our investors who supported me every step of the way Vincent Diallo, Laura Brady, Benjamin Ling, Collin Gutman, Jeff Weinstein.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmccarthynyc/,"The End of an Era

This week marks a significant turning point as I've made the decision to leave Coupa Software. This decision is wrapped in immense pride and gratitude to my colleagues (and former colleagues!), customers, partners, industry analysts, and board members from all stages. 

Walking through the Coupa doors 13 years ago, I could never have imagined the phenomenal story we'd create. We started as a fledgling company with a bold vision: to become a Salesforce -like platform for Business Spend Management. We had big dreams and even bigger determination, evident by the post-it notes that adorned our (budget-less) walls!

What followed was phenomenal growth. We grew Coupa from $1 million in recurring revenue into a $1 billion powerhouse. We built a differentiated platform, powered by an innovative community AI model. We cultivated a vibrant customer community with our spirit of “ensure customer success” driving our decisions. 

We earned over 100 software patents (24 with my name), secured leadership positions in 150+ analyst reports, and went toe-to-toe with SAP! Along the way, we had an incredible IPO, a meteoric public market rise, and ultimately, a successful Thoma Bravo privatization valued at a staggering $8 billion.

The memories I'll cherish most are the incredible IPO experience, the epic hackathons (even if held in a tiny bank vault!), fun customer advisory boards that embodied the spirit of ""none of us is as smart as all of us,"" the thrilling Great Race-style global sales cycles, and of course, the goofy product videos that hopefully made people outside Coupa laugh as much as they made us laugh in Coupa! 

To the wonderful colleagues (past and present), customers, partners, analysts, and board members that spent so much time collaborating with me personally on this journey, thank you from the bottom of my heart. It’s been an absolute honor working alongside such brilliant, hardworking, and dedicated people. I could never have played my role in Coupa’s success without you. I hope our roads cross in the future. 

While my journey at Coupa comes to a close, a new and exciting chapter for me awaits. I'm excited for the next challenge and can't wait to share the details with you all next week! In typical Donna fashion, I start on Monday. 😀 

In the meantime, tell me about your favorite Coupa memories below. Let's celebrate the incredible journey we've been on!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmccarthynyc/,"This August, I’ll begin my journey towards earning a PhD at Claremont Graduate University, and I could not be more excited!

Someone at work once criticized me I for taking on too much at once. And that stuck with me for a while. So against all my natural tendencies, I deliberately narrowed my professional focus. Not only was it hard, but I was actually LESS productive. You see, ideation is what runs through my veins- it’s what powers me. Removing my source of inspiration is like taking the engine out of a car and expecting it to run. What I’ve come to realize is that “too much” is when I am at my best. And incidentally, it’s when I’m at my happiest too. 

I look forward to diving deep into research, with the goal of advancing the profession of Resource Management, collaborating with fellow scholars and professionals, and firing on ALL cylinders. 😉 

I’ll be forever grateful for the encouragement from Paul Robinson, my family, friends, and mentors who have supported me in this new pursuit.

Thank you for being part of my journey. Here’s to new challenges, growth, and discoveries! Stay tuned for updates on my research and adventures in academia. ✨🎓

https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmccarthynyc/,"With immeasurable gratitude, I share the bittersweet news that Friday was my last day at EcoVadis. It has been a pleasure and an honor to watch the company grow into the indisputable leader in #SustainableProcurement, a market category that just barely existed when I joined nearly seven years ago. 
 
There have been so many remarkable milestones along the way. Working to make Business Sustainability Ratings a mainstream concept. Figuring out how we should pronounce our name (ee-koh-vah-dis)! Driving partnerships and integrations with all the Source to Pay and TPRM colleagues. Developing the eLearning Academy so suppliers could embrace improvement. All seven amazing SUSTAIN events, especially pivoting to an online conference just 10 days after the world locked down in 2020. Supporting two major funding rounds. Establishing critical NPS processes and insights to inform our direction. Creating so much compelling thought leadership that the share of voice is nearly unbelievable. Officially becoming a purpose-led business to “Guide all companies to a sustainable world.” Helping grow the EcoVadis solution portfolio and network to over 2.4M screened suppliers and 140K+ rated suppliers – and revelling as more companies than ever discover Sustain +Ability, getting a rating WITHOUT BEING ASKED – because it’s good business. Partnering closely with sales to achieve 10x+ ARR from 2017 to now. Navigating more acronyms and regulations than I may care to remember 😊. 

And most proudly - building from a team of 5 marketers to over 50, including dozens of nationalities, locations and functions – and somehow still creating a tight-knit group that cares deeply for each other while executing like crazy. Working with you all has been an absolute joy. 
 
My sincerest thanks to our co-CEOs, Pierre-Francois Thaler and Frederic Trinel, for this incredible opportunity to cut my teeth as a #CMO - I have learned and grown so much. To my EcoVadis leadership colleagues and all EcoVadians with whom I’ve dived deep day in and day out, thank you for your collaboration, persistence, passion and optimism – you are changing the world one company at a time. And to my dear EV marketers – thank you for everything - keep innovating and reaching for the stars. I will miss you most. Cécile Dorvault David McClintock Meena Hans Robert Altman Angie Marcel Daniel Perry

I will keep EcoVadis in my heart and cheerlead your purpose and success always!
 
What’s next? I’ll be starting on an exciting new journey later in July. Stay tuned for the news but – spoiler alert – I’m still a procurement software geek 😊!

Thrilled to announce my new role as Global VP of Sales for Basware's innovative AP Assurance solution suite!

After an incredibly rewarding 11 months leading the North American Value Advisory practice, I'm excited to take on this fresh challenge. Working under Jethro Elvin's leadership has been a privilege, and I'm grateful for the chance to dig deep into Basware's offerings and validate firsthand why they are the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation.

However, the opportunity to spearhead the global sales of AP Assurance was too compelling to pass up. This game-changing solution offers the most effective and user-friendly approach to improving working capital, which I've encountered in my experience at both SAP and Basware.
I'm truly humbled by Basware's trust and excited to collaborate with a stellar team to drive the success of AP Assurance worldwide.

Finding ways to unwind is an important part of being at your best in work and everyday life. As someone who finds it hard to fully switch off - yes, if you email me, I’ll probably still reply…

I never said it was easy!

When you enjoy what you do and work for great companies, it’s easy to blur the lines and be overactive. Sometimes, a few days recharging and reflecting is just what the doctor ordered. A few days in Rhodes, Greece should do the trick!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,"This year, we celebrate a monumental milestone—Bel Fuse Inc.'s 75th anniversary! Founded by my grandfather and now led by my father, Dan Bernstein as CEO, Bel Fuse stands as a testament to enduring success and unwavering commitment to core values.

Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the dedication, resilience, and integrity that fueled the family business. Here are some fundamental principles that have been passed down through generations, shaping not only Bel's journey but also my approach as an Operating Partner in the private equity space:

- Respecting the Team: Bel has always believed in treating employees like family. This deep respect for the team has fostered a culture of loyalty, collaboration, and mutual growth. It's a principle I hold dear, knowing that a company's true strength lies in its people. 

- Running the Business the Right Way: Integrity has always been at the heart of Bel Fuse. My grandfather's mantra of doing business the right way—fairly, ethically, and transparently—has been a cornerstone of success. This ethos guides my interactions and decisions as I work with founders to build sustainable and ethical businesses.

- Balancing Conservatism with Aggression: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the art of balancing conservative strategies with calculated risks. My father has and continues to excel at identifying moments to be bold while maintaining a prudent approach. This balance is crucial in driving growth without compromising stability.

- Consistent Leadership and Values: The importance of consistent leadership and adherence to core values cannot be overstated. At Bel Fuse, leadership is not just about steering the company but embodying the values that have been their foundation. I strive to bring this consistency to portcos I partner with, ensuring that the companies I support stay true to their roots while evolving for future success.

As I reflect on these invaluable lessons, I am filled with pride and gratitude. They have not only shaped Bel Fuse's legacy but also equipped me to support other founders on their journeys. In my current role, I leverage these insights to help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and build businesses that stand the test of time.

Here's to 75 years of Bel Fuse—and to many more years of leadership, integrity, and success!

We've all been there – you accept a LinkedIn connection request, and BAM! Immediate sales pitch. This needs to end. Imagine meeting someone on the street, them saying ""nice to meet you,"" and then instantly asking you for money or some crazy trade. You would think they are nuts.

Here's a better approach (and there are about 1000 better than the one above): leverage the accepted connection to gain insights and develop a genuine relationship. Learn what's important to them. Comment on their posts, share insights they may find valuable, and build trust and credibility through those actions.

When the time is right, send a message that aligns with what you've learned. Provide a thoughtful, Doug Landis-patented hypothesis that demonstrates you understand their business (and needs). No sales pitch is necessary in that message either!

Don't want to be treated like a spam account? Then stop acting like one.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,"This year, we celebrate a monumental milestone—Bel Fuse Inc.'s 75th anniversary! Founded by my grandfather and now led by my father, Dan Bernstein as CEO, Bel Fuse stands as a testament to enduring success and unwavering commitment to core values.

Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the dedication, resilience, and integrity that fueled the family business. Here are some fundamental principles that have been passed down through generations, shaping not only Bel's journey but also my approach as an Operating Partner in the private equity space:

- Respecting the Team: Bel has always believed in treating employees like family. This deep respect for the team has fostered a culture of loyalty, collaboration, and mutual growth. It's a principle I hold dear, knowing that a company's true strength lies in its people. 

- Running the Business the Right Way: Integrity has always been at the heart of Bel Fuse. My grandfather's mantra of doing business the right way—fairly, ethically, and transparently—has been a cornerstone of success. This ethos guides my interactions and decisions as I work with founders to build sustainable and ethical businesses.

- Balancing Conservatism with Aggression: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the art of balancing conservative strategies with calculated risks. My father has and continues to excel at identifying moments to be bold while maintaining a prudent approach. This balance is crucial in driving growth without compromising stability.

- Consistent Leadership and Values: The importance of consistent leadership and adherence to core values cannot be overstated. At Bel Fuse, leadership is not just about steering the company but embodying the values that have been their foundation. I strive to bring this consistency to portcos I partner with, ensuring that the companies I support stay true to their roots while evolving for future success.

As I reflect on these invaluable lessons, I am filled with pride and gratitude. They have not only shaped Bel Fuse's legacy but also equipped me to support other founders on their journeys. In my current role, I leverage these insights to help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and build businesses that stand the test of time.

Here's to 75 years of Bel Fuse—and to many more years of leadership, integrity, and success!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkpark/,"Managing more than 60 hotels from upstate New York all the way down to Georgia, Visions Hotels has established a benchmark for exemplary guest experience on the East Coast.

In 2019, Visions partnered with Otelier (formerly MDO) to deploy a business intelligence solution that would automate back-office reporting and centralize performance data from across its portfolio, allowing leadership unique insight to build data-driven strategies. Today, general managers, accounting teams, and corporate leaders spend less time on manual data entry and back-office tasks, freeing them up to focus on driving guest satisfaction.

""The spike in inflation over the past couple years means profitability doesn’t flow the same way it once did. So, it’s important for our team members at the property level and corporate to always be hyper aware of our daily performance,” says Jason D'Agostino, Corporate Director of Revenue Management at Visions Hotels. ""IntelliSight has been crucial for our team members who rely on automated dashboards each morning, showing rooms sold, GSS scores, rate-shopping data, our STAR reports, all in one spot.""

My journey with BlackRock actually started well before I joined the firm. As BlackRock’s investment banker at Merrill Lynch, I helped BlackRock launch some of its early closed end funds. When I decided to join BlackRock officially in 2000 as the head of the retail team, I could only imagine what an amazing and fulfilling career journey I would have - helping to build one of the best investment management firms in the world. 
 
For the last nine years, I have had the privilege of leading BlackRock’s US retirement business. I am so grateful to our clients, who helped me understand what it means for their employees to retire with dignity. I have been humbled by the work of so many in the industry to make the retirement system work for everyone. I have been inspired by my colleagues’ passion to make secure retirements within the reach of every worker. 
 
Now, it’s my turn. And, if I’m honest, it’s a little weird. I don’t have plans to slow down any time soon. Frankly, the word “retirement” just doesn’t fit how I feel. I see it more as my “next chapter” – and I really like the Spanish word for it: jubilacion. Because that is how I feel. Joyful.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-mcneely-9060b8206/,"Do you also suffer from ONE thing that can hinder your career progression and may make your day to day work a struggle?



These statements were taken randomly from some of my clients’ worksheets, do you recognise yourself in any of them?


🥺 Usually, I doubt myself and find out later that I was right at first.


😟 I do care very heavily about what people think about me.


🤨 I want people to know that “he’s good” at what he does. I want that reputation.


😒 I worry about the perception from colleagues


😰 My procrastination on the task that scares me the most: prepping well for the evaluation session. I am to some extent afraid of being successful, so I don’t even try.



So, what is that ONE thing?



These days it is conveniently referred to as “the impostor syndrome” however, it is a combination of several intertwined thought patterns and behaviours that may be difficult to dissect and understand. They could include:

-Depending excessively on external validation

-Self doubt

-Lack of confidence

-Feeling not good enough (or a fraud)

-Fear of failure

-Fear of success

And more…

If you have experienced similar thoughts, moods, emotions that have impacted your performance, your clarity and drive and as a result you are “selling yourself short” or are not being as bold as you’d like, know that:

✳️ Even the most successful, powerful people have these experiences

✳️ Consistent work on yourself will pay off – understanding your limiting beliefs is a first step!

✳️ You can “feel the fear and do it anyway!” but that’s so much easier if someone has your back

✳️ What other people think of you – is none of your business!

✳️ What you think of yourself is entirely your business!

✳️ Focus on YOU and not on others. Do what you can, with what you’ve got – NOW

✳️ Love your life and your life will love you back!

And if this is not enough, do talk to me – I’m very high on compassion (according to Jordan Peterson - more than 93 people in a room of 100) and I can also teach you some saboteur-slaying techniques! 🤣 😜

https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-mcneely-9060b8206/,"Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I would like to share with you that on May 20, 2024, our beloved dad, Shan K. Thever, passed away.

Our dad was a vibrant personality, energetic professional and dedicated husband, father and grandfather. He was an inspiration in so many ways and to so many people. 

He came to this country with only a few hundred dollars in his pocket. Through his determination, hard work and tenacity, he successfully completed his undergraduate education at UCLA and received his JD from UCLA School of Law. 

Our dad went on to establish and lead a successful law practice for decades. He was a trailblazer and a pioneer both in and out of the courtroom. He was courageous, took risks and overcame numerous obstacles, and was a preeminent attorney, successfully arguing cases in front of the California Supreme Court. He served as the Director of the Small Law Firm Center at the New York City Bar Association and for the past five years he served as the Deputy County Council for Los Angeles County as a member of the Ethics, Transparency and Legislative Affairs team.

Our dad was a colleague, friend and confidant of Governors, County Supervisors, Council Members and so many others. In addition to numerous awards and appointments, he received the inaugural Trailblazer Award from the South Asian Bar Association and was recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives, receiving a U.S. Congressional Commendation for being an inspiring leader in the South Asian community and a true advocate for political change among the Asian population.

He was an inspiration not only for the professional success he achieved, but also for the way he lived his life. He believed in living a productive and meaningful life, in helping others, in lifting his community and in creating greater opportunity for his children than he had himself. He instilled in us a deep responsibility to, in turn, create greater opportunity for our children and generations to come. He also instilled in us the importance of public service and of being contributing members of society and having a meaningful impact on the world.

In his personal time he loved to be with his family celebrating holidays, cooking together, and discussing politics and current events over a bottle of Cabernet. 

He loved his grandchildren more than anything and was so very proud to see the young people they are and the success they continue to achieve. He was happy to see the wealth of opportunity in front of them. 

While he may not be here in physical form, our dad is always with us. He lived a successful, productive and impactful life, and this world is a better place because of him.

We ask that if you have any special anecdotes, stories or memories about our dad to please share with us via private message.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-mcneely-9060b8206/,MISC,,Image,Douglas,McNeely,The Carlyle Group,Private Equity,Managing Director,2024-07-02 16:16,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209246271130210304,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQES03wPBTb65Q/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718739078524?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=kwKxo88ddNzLHqySa9bEgpIhsfR1naydmhBbCYbaN9c,,,,,144,31,0,2w,,,,Douglas McNeely supports this,,,2024-06-19 13:30,,,,,,,,,Wednesday,5:30 PM,6/19/2024,,,,,,,,,

💸 The average WNBA player lasts about 5 years in the league, also retiring in their early 30s

- Where are you?
- What are you doing?
- Where are you living?
- What activities are you enjoying?
- How often do you travel? to where?
- What car are you driving?
- What are your ongoing sources of income?
- Are you working?
- Have you invested in assets that accumulate value over time?
- Are you aligning your money with your values? How?
- What makes you feel alive?
- What is keeping you active, fulfilled, finding purpose and meaning?

CrowdStrike is a critical cybersecurity partner, allowing us to consolidate multiple products on the Falcon platform. CRM is Salesforce. Cybersecurity is CrowdStrike.” 

▶ Matt Garman, CEO, Amazon Web Services (AWS): “CrowdStrike’s inclusion in the S&P 500 is a well-deserved milestone that underscores their pioneering work in cybersecurity. CrowdStrike is a trusted AWS customer and partner, and we have a long history of working together to secure sensitive data and workloads for the world’s most innovative and highly regulated organizations, from startups to enterprises to governments. Congratulations to the CrowdStrike team on this significant achievement.”

▶ Toto Wolff, Team Principal & CEO, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team: “In car production and motorsport, speed, quality and consistency are key to success. Working closely with George Kurtz and the CrowdStrike team, I couldn’t be prouder of the cybersecurity outcomes they deliver.
