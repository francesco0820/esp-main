"Today marks the beginning of National Drive Electric Week – a nationwide celebration to raise awareness for benefits of electric vehicles (#EV). 🚗 The industry is nascent with challenges that we need to work through: municipalities with “garage orphans;” affordable access for low-income customers; and the need for a reliable public charging infrastructure. At Eversource Energy we’re committed to expanding access to clean transportation solutions for as many people as possible.

Recently Sean Tully, manager of electric mobility at Eversource, spoke to Boston Globe Media about the steps we’re taking in cities like Cambridge to broaden the EV charging infrastructure. Initiatives like sidewalk charging programs will encourage more EV ownership in some of these densely populated areas, which also tend to have higher rates of CO2 emissions.

"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 🌈✨

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

🔷 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

🔷 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

🔷 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

🔷 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

🔷 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

What if we started sharing our own resources with our small-business customers? And how does that interrelate with one of our core values, to be a force for good?'” 

Leah Carter gives the SmallBizCo-Op program high marks. “I became a customer right as they were getting ready to launch everything,” says Carter, owner of A Play Cafe, an indoor playground and coffee shop in the Dallas suburb of Duncanville.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:ðŸŒŒ Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. ðŸ‘“ Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. ðŸŽ­ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. ðŸ•¶ï¸ Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) ðŸŒ Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology","Digital transformation,Innovation,AI/Machine Learning,Data and Analytics",checked

"Whatâ€™s the difference between the many types of AI? Here is a quick explanation below.As a note - there are many types of machine learning that donâ€™t use neural networks. Even though probably 70-75% of machine learning uses the Deep Learning/Neural Network architecture, there are a lot of applications outside of it.The best example is gradient boosting trees. Itâ€™s an algorithm for tabular AI and is used for more structured data and predictive analytics. It still outperforms the neural network setup for that particular use case.Hope this helps!hashtag#AI hashtag#ML hashtag#genai hashtag#llm hashtag#neuralnetworks","AI/Machine Learning,Innovation",

"ðŸ” Defense tech is one of the hottest sectors in VC right now. Hereâ€™s why:â€” The U.S. is updating its defense strategy to use cutting-edge technology against growing adversarial threats, emphasizing the need for innovative protective solutions.â€” Despite large IT investments, government tech is outdated, prompting moves like the ""DoD Software Modernization Plan"" to gain a defense edge with new software.â€” Rising global threats and a focus on tech are driving more defense spending, especially in IT and cybersecurity.â€” Better pay and an innovative culture in the private sector attract top talent from federal roles, benefiting defense startups with skilled experts for custom solutions.While the potential for groundbreaking impact in defense tech is exciting, navigating the complex and highly regulated defense procurement landscape requires creativity, influential relationships, and persistence. For startups, itâ€™s not just about entering the conversation, but also successfully navigating DoD selling and contracting.For a deeper dive into observations and the opportunities in defense tech ahead, check out our latest blog: https://lnkd.in/gzV9cw5U Please let us know what you think in the comments below.CC: Alex Lehman & Adam Liuhashtag#DefenseTech hashtag#VentureCapital","Innovation,Data and Analytics",checked

Rather than avoiding AI, the department is scrutinizing the fundamental requirements for training inputs, outputs, and modeling.

The answer lies not in the methodology itself, but in the organizational inertia. Organizations, slaves of their medieval service organization models, struggle to make the shift towards user-centricity, however, none of them lack terms such as ""Tribe lead"" or ""MVP"", I mean, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.ðˆð¥ð¥ð®ð¦ð¢ð§ðšð­ð¢ð§ð  ð­ð¡ðž ð©ðšð­ð¡Unfortunately this is not an exception but rather the rule and I understand that organizations want to change but don't really know where to dig, well, here is a simple Roadmap to get started:â€¢ Know your users!!!: simple but we still don't get it.

"Last Friday, I had the immense honor of delivering the keynote speech at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Expo, held at the Challenger Learning Center in the vibrant heart of downtown Tallahassee. My talk, titled ""Harnessing AI to Complete the Bench to Bedside Loop in Healthcare,"" aimed to illuminate the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing healthcare, drawing parallels with the iterative nature of space exploration.In the realm of healthcare, the journey from molecular hypothesis (the bench) to the development of a drug and its validation in the real world (the bedside) is intricate and complex. Yet, this is where the magic happens, and AI steps in to bridge the gap. Through my keynote, I explored how AI not only accelerates this process but also enhances our ability to iterate and optimize continuously, ensuring that real-world evidence feeds back into our molecular hypotheses, thereby refining and advancing our understanding.The bench to bedside loop represents a cornerstone of medical research and development, embodying the essence of iterative optimization. With AI, we stand on the brink of being able to automate, scale, and accelerate these iterations like never before, opening up unprecedented possibilities for healthcare advancements.As we say, ""Per aspera ad astra"" - through hardships to the stars. The path to harnessing AI in healthcare is fraught with challenges, but it is also filled with immense potential and hope. I am thrilled to be a part of this journey, contributing to the efforts that aim to revolutionize healthcare for the betterment of humanity.Thank you Florida State University for the invitation!

"â“RAG demos are easy. RAG in production is much harder. Why is it so?Recently I wrote about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the technique that enables enterprises to leverage the power of large language models (link in comment ).Many companies have experienced that their technology teams are able to demonstrate the use of RAG quite rapidly. However, when the time comes to put the solution into production, they face difficulties. The users do not accept the solution easily and many donâ€™t think it adds a lot of value.We will first see why the demos are easy and then reflect on the challenge of productionising RAG.Why are RAG demos easy?ðŸ‘‰ Simple architecture: The principle of RAG is quite simple to understand. In the basic RAG pipeline, there are very few components: vector database, source chunking, vector matching and LLM interface. It is easy for engineers to understand the architecture.ðŸ‘‰ Framework availability: To make matters simpler, helper frameworks such as Langchain and LlamaIndex are available. They come with built-in support for chunking, vector databases and LLMs. It is possible to build an RAG pipeline by writing a few lines of code, if you are using one of these frameworks. The initial results of such a pipeline are very impressive, mainly because of the language abilities of the LLMs. Thus great demonstrations can be built quickly with RAG. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»Now we will see why using RAG in production is challenging. ðŸ‘‰ Correct but not comprehensive: For simpler questions, the replies are often satisfactory. However, when complex questions are asked, the users find the answers correct, but not satisfactory. They feel that the reply covers only basic aspects, but not what they really needed.ðŸ‘‰ Source requirements: In order that RAG works, the necessary knowledge sources should be added to the vector index. It takes a lot of effort to judge the requirements of users and accordingly build the index. It does not stop here. The index must be forever updated with current information.ðŸ‘‰ Easy to add, difficult to remove: Once a source is added to the index, it starts influencing the answers. Many times, multiple sources contain conflicting information (for example, old and new price list). The answers in this case become unreliable.ðŸ‘‰ Data privacy: The quick RAG implementations typically use an external LLM api such as OpenAI or Google. In such cases, the internal data of an organization is sent to the outside world; creating a possibility of data privacy issues.ðŸ‘‰ Latency: As the index size grows, it takes a long time to select the right material for a query. This is unacceptable for real time use.Overcoming these challenges involves building a more complex pipeline. I will describe that in a later post, but here are some techniques that can help: reranking, knowledge graph, internal models, trust layers.hashtag#llm hashtag#retrievalaugmentedgeneration hashtag#aiinbusiness","Data and Analytics,Innovation,Human-centered design",checked

"Dear Leaders, if 80% of people work harder when they feel more appreciated, it is not about whether you work on recognition, but how!

Saying “thank you” doesn’t hurt you - but not saying “thank you” can hurt others. So, No brainer!

Start asking yourself the following questions as a leader:

💡What does recognition mean for me (e.g. mainly monetary)?
💡 What do I usually recognize my people for (e.g. doing their job, over-performing, learning new skills)?
💡 My people might expect very different recognition elements: Have I ever asked what they need to feel appreciated?
💡 Does my company have a recognition program I can use elements from?


And then take genuine and frequent action to build an environment of recognition:

1️⃣ Take the input from your team seriously and be as close to expectations as possible.
2️⃣ Recognize people based on specific results and behaviors - in 1:1 situations but more in the broader team. It helps appreciate the right behaviour and results more broadly.
3️⃣ Empower your people deliberately to then recognize their own decisions and ways of achieving results.
4️⃣ Recognize your people unexpectedly, it is more powerful.
5️⃣ Implement ways of top down (from your manager) and peer to peer recognition.
6️⃣ Make saying “thank you” a natural part of everyday work in the team an beyond.

If you establish a culture of recognition, you will also affect people in a way that might be new to you: Recognition has a physiological impact on performance. Oxytocin is the well-known “love hormone.” Our bodies create Oxytocin when we feel loved or appreciated.

"Last month, I was joined by 25 leaders across a dozen or so industries to discuss some of the more pressing questions around AI leadership, driving adoption, responsible deployment, the crucial balance between upskilling existing talent & bringing in fresh perspectives to bolster AI capabilities, and securing funding for AI initiatives.This morning, I had a seat at the table with another group of 25 data, analytics, and AI leaders to dig deeper. Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity.
