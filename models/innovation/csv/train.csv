"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not Innovation
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question. Pierce denial. Pierce lies. Pierce the surface.hashtag#emotionalintelligencehashtag#purposehashtag#iqeqtqThis picture is a fair representation of how I look when I receive compliments. A lot happy.

"Until now, I seldom shared my personal story because I had always considered myself the plainest person you could ever meet: Karen Jones from East Street in Ware, Massachusetts, a mill town founded in 1717 with a population just over 10,000.If someone had asked me what my career goal was in high school or college, I don't know if I would have aimed very high. At that time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a specific kind of individual considered to be leadership material, and as a result, able to access broad professional opportunities. Those individuals didn't look like me or have my background. I worked hard throughout college, balancing school and a part-time job. After college, I earned a series of jobs in the business field and worked diligently to deliver on my professional commitments. This is what we're supposed to do to advance our careers, right? And yet, after many years of professional experience, I was told I didn't fit the profile when I was being considered for a senior executive role at a large company. I recall one particular story: Earlier in my career, while working as a mid-level manager, I was invited to a meeting with the senior managers of my division. I'd worked at the company for years, coming in early and leaving late, keeping my head down, and putting in long hours. I believed all of this would lead to the next career step. So, I was excited to participate in this meeting, which I considered to be recognition of my success and standing at the company. I remember my heart racing as I tried to appear calm while walking down the hall to the executive conference room. I'd never been in this room, nor in the presence of these divisional leaders. I tried anticipating the questions that would come up and how I might answer them if asked. As I entered the room, I asked one of the leaders where I should sit. Barely glancing up, he said, ""Sit in the back, not at the table, because women just take up space.""I want my story to inspire others to lead differently. I want to share how I've used my voice to overcome barriers and create opportunities to make a difference. I hope my story becomes part of the conversation around taking up space and that it encourages others to do the same.That's why I wrote a book. I called it""what else""""Taking Up Space."" And that's why I'm donating the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations whose missions and initiatives support mental well-being and empower young women "" two causes that are important to my story.Thank you for allowing me to share my story with you "" and if you have a moment, I would love to hear yours.",Not Innovation

"Ys Achieved Amazon Ads Retail Certification! YsE-commerce and retail media, in particular, have grown incredibly over the past couple of years. At its most simplistic form, commerce media is about connecting media investment to sales data. For example on Amazon, an advertiser can measure down to ASIN-level sale. That is why overall we are seeing so much growth in commerce media, because we now have that level of attribution. Learning never stops, no matter where I am in my career journey. This year, as part of my professional growth and development goal, I am committing to taking as many commerce and retail media courses and certification as possible. I loved diving deep into the Amazon Ads Retail Certification course where I learned about retail readiness, Amazon's fulfillment solutions, the different aspects of selling on Amazon.com, how to launch a new product on Amazon.com, as well as, navigating Seller Central and Vendor Central. I highly recommend this course for anyone in advertising and marketing who wants to understand e-commerce operations and advertising campaigns.

"Let's recap what appears to be complete BS against Trump. The man wins an election against an unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton
. They pay for a fake dossier and claim it's not the American people who elected him but the Russians. A Special Counsel is appointed, millions of dollars are spent, and the conclusion is that there was never any collusion between Trump and the Russians. It was the American people who elected him. It was complete BS.

Once in the White House, a woman writes a memoir and claims Trump sexually assaulted her several decades ago. Trump says no, I never did what she is accusing me of. New York then changes the law so she could bring charges decades after. She's actually unable to provide any direct evidence because she waited decades to report the alleged assault. The case proceeds anyway; eventually, after back and forth, Trump has to pay her millions of dollars for defamation. In interviews, she says she can't wait to receive the money so that she can go shopping worldwide. She also says the sexual assault was never sexual; claims rape is sexy. The media ignores the inconsistencies because that's not what the so-called deep state wants.

A porn actress also comes out and says she had an affair with Trump decades ago, and Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. The government says, wow! That's such huge information, had the American people known that they would have elected Clinton. Several people say there's no case to be made there; eventually, the case goes to court with the government claiming that he did not specifically disclose that the legal fee was somehow a campaign contribution. Anyway, they convict Trump. Meanwhile, the porn industry exploits all these women and men, paying them only a small fee once to shoot their movies and using them for decades without ever paying them any other fee. One would think a government that cares about porn actresses would try to help them and stop the exploitation. No, they actually don't care.

I can go on and on. When junior journalists receive information from the government in the form of indictments, they often believe everything the government says, that they are just there trying to punish deadly criminals in society, that they are trying to stop a dangerous guy. Meanwhile, the so-called dangerous man has not done all the atrocities others have done in terms of laws that punish ordinary people, including some based on their race, and bombs all over the world that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Of course, Trump is not a perfect man. People attack him; he also attacks people, and so do you.

But the false claim that he's the worst American to have ever lived and that now he's akin to Adolf Hitler and if he's re-elected again, doom and gloom would envelop the United States are simply false. Now they are claiming that he's so crazy he might attack Biden on stage on June 27 when they debate in Atlanta next week. The hypocrisy is really disgusting. May God help us all.",Not Innovation

"Wrapped up Day 2 at the #LWTSummit! 

Our morning kickstarted with the infectious energy of our hosts, Danielle Moodie and Andrea Minkow, who kept the vibes lively and the laughter contagious throughout the day. 

CEO & Founder of Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Leanne Pittsford, took us through #LWTSummit's history and her inspiring vision for the future. I'm grateful for her trailblazing spirit that brought this incredible summit to life.

The day unfolded with a diverse lineup of EXCEPTIONAL speakers across various tech & activism lanes. Although I couldn't be omnipresent (cue the wish for cloning technology), I was fortunate to catch some remarkable talks:

 Sissie Hsiao, VP/GM, Google Assistant and Bard at Google, delved into the transformative potential of generative AI in driving innovation.

 Raquel Willis, an award-winning Author and Activist, and Alicia Garza, principal of the Black Futures Lab, sparked insightful conversations on the confluence of gender, race, and societal change, drawing from their extensive activism experiences.

 Pat Wadors, Chief People Officer at UGK, shed light on leveraging technology to foster inclusivity, engagement, and growth within organizations.

 Julie Durham, Chief Technology Officer at UnitedHealthCare, shared invaluable insights into how digital strategies can revolutionize patient experiences and healthcare outcomes.

 Jacqueline Guichelaar, Chief Experience Officer at Cisco, emphasized the critical need to fortify cybersecurity measures in our increasingly interconnected world.

The day also featured a showcase of Rising Voices Films, including 'Order for Pickup' by Jackie! Zhoe, 'Rocky Road on Channel Three' by James Rogers III, and 'Mara Has Three Jobs in San Juan, Puerto Rico' by Ana Verde. These films made me CRY and so... I NEED you to check them out at https://lnkd.in/gipTRPrq 

Beverly Jackson, VP of Brand & Product Marketing at Zillow, inspired us with insights into driving successful product marketing campaigns, highlighting how data and AI can create impactful brand experiences.

Then Layshia Clarendon discussed the intersection of Activism & Sports, beautifully moderated by Arlan Hamilton. Layshia's candid sharing about her non-binary identity struck a chord with me (I cried again), because it echoed my own journey of self-discovery & acceptance through my non-binary identity. 

The insightful session with Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn, and Imani Dunbar, Head of Equity at LinkedIn, underscored the significance of leading through change with a skills-first mindset.

LaFawn Davis chatted with Miguel Angel Caballero, Director, Writer, Producer of 'The Ballad of Tita and the Machines,' and Rishi Rajani, CEO of Hillman Grad Productions, unpacking the profound impact of authentic storytelling.

It was a day of empowerment and heartfelt connections! 
I'm looking forward to what Day 3 has in store.

"This year, you are going to hear a lot about ""Spatial Computing"" and ""Mixed Reality."" But what exactly do these terms mean? And how do they relate to the terms we have been hearing for a while now, like ""augmented reality,"" ""virtual reality,"" and ""metaverse""? Here's a crash course on the terminology linked to the next wave of computing:Y Spatial Computing is the umbrella term for technologies and processes that enable computers to perceive, interact with, and navigate 3D space. This includes augmented reality, mixed reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more. Y Augmented Reality (AR): AR overlays digital content on the real world. Users can see and interact with virtual content as if they are in the space around them with devices like smartphones and smart glasses. For example, you see a 3D dinosaur superimposed onto your living room through your phone, looking like it's standing next to your couch. YZ Mixed Reality (MR): The best way to think about MR is a subset or more advanced form of AR. It goes beyond the overlay and provides a deeper integration and interaction between the real and digital worlds. It typically involves advanced spatial awareness, more complex interactivity, and a higher degree of immersion (such as a headset). For example, using a headset, you see a 3D dinosaur roam around your room, walk behind your table, cast a shadow under the lamp, and playfully react when you toss a virtual ball, utilizing the entire space as its stomping ground. Yi  Virtual Reality (VR): VR immerses users in a completely digital environment where they can interact with virtual objects and scenarios as if they were real. It typically requires a headset, often called an HMD or head-mounted display. For example, wearing a headset, you find yourself in a simulated prehistoric world, standing next to a life-sized dinosaur in a fully immersive 360-degree environment.What about XR? XR stands for ""Extended Reality"" and is the umbrella term encompassing AR, VR, and MR. IMHO, it was created because people get tired of saying AR/VR/MR in one sentence ;) Y Metaverse, IMHO, is a term that describes the future online experience, much like how we used ""the information superhighway"" in the early 90s. Matthew Ball defines this as ""a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences and also underpin much of the physical world."" It is enabled by spatial computing technologies. Do you have other ways you have been describing these terms to clients, friends, colleagues, or family members? Leave them in the comments! NOTE: I want to recognize that there is a lot of history behind many of these terms that have been around for a long time (e.g., Milgram's mixed reality spectrum). The definitions above reflect how I see the terms currently being used. hashtag#spatialcomputing hashtag#metaverse hashtag#augmentedreality hashtag#virtualreality hashtag#mixedreality hashtag#technology",Innovation

Through virtual interactions, parents and caregivers can access supportive resources without bedside care interruptions. The virtual nursing care model allows for the removal of administrative tasks from the bedside nurse and takes family-centered care ""beyond the bedside"" by offering coordinated, convenient support to patients using technology.""Protecting our teams from burnout continues to be a top priority""with this redesign of duties, we can work to retain nurses who may have otherwise left the bedside and continue delivering compassionate care to families"" shared Ashley Simms, MBA, BSN, RN, NEA-BC, Assistant Vice President, Nursing.hashtag#healthcareinnovation hashtag#healthcareheroes hashtag#virtualnursing hashtag#OneAmazingTeam",Innovation

Rather than avoiding AI, the department is scrutinizing the fundamental requirements for training inputs, outputs, and modeling. A noteworthy update is the decision to be less prescriptive compared to other RMF overlaps, offering a more comprehensive view of the AI environment.

"sY    z Y  s  sz- z z z   s zzz2- z sz zz Y1""(...) it's about the hashtag#mindset"" Is the phrase that stuck in my head after a conversation with a good friend about dependencies between teams. It made me reflect and I took one step back to embark in a journey which made me think...   zWhen an organization bets for a tech-first approach, the question shifts from ""how can this hashtag#technology solve a user problem?"" to ""how can we use this technology, regardless of any user problem?"" And the anxiety to hunt problems which could fit the technology starts.   szWith a tech-first approach an organization, obviously, is not going to start aligning teams around user-segments but around tech. What does it happen when ""Agile"" starts kicking-in? Teams slice ""epics"" into user-stories but something we don't notice (maybe nobody does) is that we are also slicing the user-journey and so slicing the end-to-end hashtag#value stream to a ""maybe"" or even no-value stream. This is when pointless conversations about dependencies start, feeling that we are solving a big problem for our users when what we are really doing is entering in a maze with no way out.Z s3s s zsAgile, in its core principles, aims to minimize, not manage, dependencies, so, why do Agile teams find themselves managing dependencies without really knowing how they ended up there? The answer lies not in the methodology itself, but in the organizational inertia. Organizations, slaves of their medieval service organization models, struggle to make the shift towards user-centricity, however, none of them lack terms such as ""Tribe lead"" or ""MVP"", I mean, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.s  z sUnfortunately this is not an exception but rather the rule and I understand that organizations want to change but don't really know where to dig, well, here is a simple Roadmap to get started:"" Know your users!!!: simple but we still don't get it. Talk with your users and segment them into specific needs and challenges"" Getting organized around what we want to achieve. Form teams representing the entire end-to-end value stream, not just technology silos. Believe it or not, most of the times, users are not excited about the technology but about seeing their problems solved"" Effectiveness over efficiency. Is not about how many <Agile term> did we deliver, but did we solve any problem for our users?""

"Last Friday, I had the immense honor of delivering the keynote speech at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Expo, held at the Challenger Learning Center in the vibrant heart of downtown Tallahassee. My talk, titled ""Harnessing AI to Complete the Bench to Bedside Loop in Healthcare,"" aimed to illuminate the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing healthcare, drawing parallels with the iterative nature of space exploration.In the realm of healthcare, the journey from molecular hypothesis (the bench) to the development of a drug and its validation in the real world (the bedside) is intricate and complex. Yet, this is where the magic happens, and AI steps in to bridge the gap. Through my keynote, I explored how AI not only accelerates this process but also enhances our ability to iterate and optimize continuously, ensuring that real-world evidence feeds back into our molecular hypotheses, thereby refining and advancing our understanding.The bench to bedside loop represents a cornerstone of medical research and development, embodying the essence of iterative optimization. With AI, we stand on the brink of being able to automate, scale, and accelerate these iterations like never before, opening up unprecedented possibilities for healthcare advancements.As we say, ""Per aspera ad astra"" - through hardships to the stars. The path to harnessing AI in healthcare is fraught with challenges, but it is also filled with immense potential and hope. I am thrilled to be a part of this journey, contributing to the efforts that aim to revolutionize healthcare for the betterment of humanity.Thank you Florida State University for the invitation!

"aRAG demos are easy. RAG in production is much harder. Why is it so?Recently I wrote about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the technique that enables enterprises to leverage the power of large language models (link in comment ).Many companies have experienced that their technology teams are able to demonstrate the use of RAG quite rapidly. However, when the time comes to put the solution into production, they face difficulties. The users do not accept the solution easily and many don't think it adds a lot of value.We will first see why the demos are easy and then reflect on the challenge of productionising RAG.Why are RAG demos easy?Y Simple architecture: The principle of RAG is quite simple to understand. In the basic RAG pipeline, there are very few components: vector database, source chunking, vector matching and LLM interface. It is easy for engineers to understand the architecture.Y Framework availability: To make matters simpler, helper frameworks such as Langchain and LlamaIndex are available. They come with built-in support for chunking, vector databases and LLMs. It is possible to build an RAG pipeline by writing a few lines of code, if you are using one of these frameworks. The initial results of such a pipeline are very impressive, mainly because of the language abilities of the LLMs. Thus great demonstrations can be built quickly with RAG. YYNow we will see why using RAG in production is challenging. Y Correct but not comprehensive: For simpler questions, the replies are often satisfactory. However, when complex questions are asked, the users find the answers correct, but not satisfactory. They feel that the reply covers only basic aspects, but not what they really needed.Y Source requirements: In order that RAG works, the necessary knowledge sources should be added to the vector index. It takes a lot of effort to judge the requirements of users and accordingly build the index. It does not stop here. The index must be forever updated with current information.Y Easy to add, difficult to remove: Once a source is added to the index, it starts influencing the answers. Many times, multiple sources contain conflicting information (for example, old and new price list). The answers in this case become unreliable.Y Data privacy: The quick RAG implementations typically use an external LLM api such as OpenAI or Google. In such cases, the internal data of an organization is sent to the outside world; creating a possibility of data privacy issues.Y Latency: As the index size grows, it takes a long time to select the right material for a query. This is unacceptable for real time use.Overcoming these challenges involves building a more complex pipeline. I will describe that in a later post, but here are some techniques that can help: reranking, knowledge graph, internal models, trust layers.hashtag#llm hashtag#retrievalaugmentedgeneration hashtag#aiinbusiness",Innovation

"Dear Leaders, if 80% of people work harder when they feel more appreciated, it is not about whether you work on recognition, but how!

Saying thank you doesnt hurt you - but not saying thank you can hurt others. So, No brainer!

Start asking yourself the following questions as a leader:

What does recognition mean for me (e.g. mainly monetary)?
 What do I usually recognize my people for (e.g. doing their job, over-performing, learning new skills)?
 My people might expect very different recognition elements: Have I ever asked what they need to feel appreciated?
 Does my company have a recognition program I can use elements from?


And then take genuine and frequent action to build an environment of recognition:

1 Take the input from your team seriously and be as close to expectations as possible.
2 Recognize people based on specific results and behaviors - in 1:1 situations but more in the broader team. It helps appreciate the right behaviour and results more broadly.
3 Empower your people deliberately to then recognize their own decisions and ways of achieving results.
4 Recognize your people unexpectedly, it is more powerful.
5 Implement ways of top down (from your manager) and peer to peer recognition.
6 Make saying thank you a natural part of everyday work in the team an beyond.

If you establish a culture of recognition, you will also affect people in a way that might be new to you: Recognition has a physiological impact on performance. Oxytocin is the well-known love hormone. Our bodies create Oxytocin when we feel loved or appreciated.

Here's what I learned:-Organizations employ diverse approaches in handling AI ethics and bias. While some have robust frameworks for model risk management and AI governing principles in place, others are still crafting their strategies, debating between off-the-shelf solutions or bespoke ones tailored to their needs.-Development and training needs to be an ongoing effort. This includes the implementation of mandatory training programs aimed at educating employees on data and AI tools. Some organizations provide access to AI tools post-training and introduce internal tools that are accessible behind the organization's firewall. -To address concerns regarding data access and potential misuse, developing tools intended to monitor and control the input and output of AI models is crucial. Utilizing digital rights management can also regulate document sharing effectively.-Navigating the legal and contractual landscape of AI usage adds complexity. Organizations are implementing measures like acceptable tool lists, usage tracking, and effective communication around risk.-The application of GenAI in content generation demands clearer legal and regulatory guidance. Some organizations have airtight governance processes to ensure the responsible utilization of their AI tools.-While there are common risk factors across internal applications and customer-facing applications, there are additional concerns regarding the associated risks with customer-facing applications, particularly in safety-critical industries.-Future topics for discussion will include customizing and securing OpenAI chat interfaces, the complexities of data security, ensuring employee familiarity with administrative protocols, and optimizing OpenAI API usage.We look forward to reconvening next month.

"What makes an innovative organisation? It's more than just actions, over words. It's in their willingness to take chances, in their courage to experiment, and in their constant state of curiosity. 

They see challenges as opportunities. Continuously improving, evolving and refusing to accept how they work today, as how they want to work tomorrow.

It's in their hunt for humility, an open arms approach to learning, the abolition of ego, and the warmth, respect and veracious hunger for the input of others.

Innovation cultures are forged from diverse and inclusive engagements involving unusual suspects. A melting pot of combustible people and materials that meet in sometimes bizarre and serendipitous ways to spark unexpected yet powerful reactions. It's a mindset, and it's in the DNA of the organisation, the particles and bonds, the synaptic connections, how they fuse and branch.

Innovative organisations are melting pots of divergent minds. They celebrate the value of difference. A little bit of the past, a pinch of the present, and a heavy hit of the future. Drucker was right when he said culture eats strategy for breakfast Paul. One could argue it eats it for lunch and dinner too.

For National Grid to have deployed Ideaonomy AI as part of their inaugural innovation day, a start up less than a year old, to a host of senior stakeholders speaks volumes.  We're proud to work with clients who have guts. Without guts, there will be no change. We can't play it safe and still expect to win.

Big thanks Ben, David, Sander, Chris, Gerard, Linda, Caroline, Oli, Phillipa, Sarah, Mark, Jonathan, Paula, Nora, Stephen, Matthew.
