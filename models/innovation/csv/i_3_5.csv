We encountered this requirement and took it as an opportunity to develop a parser capable of extracting point cloud data from #E57. Today, we are thrilled to announce that our parser is now publicly available on #npmjs. This opens up new possibilities for the #three.js #community, as developers can now easily integrate E57 data into their projects. For more information, please refer to the three-e57-loader on npmjs https://lnkd.in/dUhBfvcv“ For those unfamiliar with E57, it's a compact, #vendor-neutral file format that is widely used in the 3D #imaging industry for storing point clouds, images, and metadata produced by 3D imaging systems, such as laser scanners. This makes it a crucial tool for many applications, including 3D modeling, virtual reality, and more. With our new parser, working with E57 data in three.js has never been easier.We hope you find it useful for your projects. “ Reach out to us to learn more about how Prolincur can help you in your 3D journey. Visit our website https://prolincur.com, give us a call, or send us an email.

That's always what came first for us."" ”Daniel EkLet's rewind to get the full context: (As Daniel told Stockholm Tech Fest 2015)2002Daniel had the idea of Spotify when he experienced the magic of Napster. He loved the concept but hated the business model. He felt, ""Holy shit, this is what I want to do."" The timing just wasn't right. 2006Daniel and his co-founder Martin Lorentzon both had just sold their prior companies. They were figuring out what to build next. They eventually agreed there was a compelling opportunity to make Napster with the right business model.They started the company with a bunch of people at the KTH Royal Tech Institute in Stockholm. And they communicated a simple vision: ""Imagine having all the world's music in your iTunes library."" 2007One of the people making that vision a reality was lead designer Rasmuss Anderson (who has since gone on to also help design the first version of Figma). Working closely with the team, he created this iconic wireframe that defined the Spotify user experience:1. Launch app2. Login to spotify3. Personalize your homepage experience4. Discover & play unlimited musicBut the Spotify idea didn't start out this perfect. They iterated and iterated until they had something that would not just work, but delight users. The result is these early interactions still define the app we see today.2008After two years of iterating on the product, Spotify actually launched in Europe. The team waited until they could ""provide the best possible service."" And the result was wildfire. Spotify experienced hockey stick growth in Europe, went global in 2011, and public in 2018. The key lesson? Iterating on wireframes was done extensively before they ever wrote any code. This is a great takeaway for product builders of all types:Don't skip your wireframes!","Innovation,User Experience",,Personal/Public Pictures,,Brandy,Brown,Wells Fargo,Banking,"SVP, Digital Product Management Director",2251,177,104,1w,,,,Brandy Brown likes this,Likes,,2024-04-11 01:33,4/11/2024,Thursday,Thursday,1:33 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,2532,Engagement,1am-2am,April 2024,

We were so successful that, today, the panel is not the biggest cost driver for solar deployments. For utility-scale, land and labor are often larger cost components. For residential rooftops, believe it or not, marketing and customer acquisition costs are often the largest expense. Perovskite-based tandems add value by tackling land and labor costs, greatly impacting the total cost of ownership (TCO). Since our panels can be 25-40% more efficient than conventional panels, that means we can save 25-40% of land and labor costs, often more than the entire cost of the panel itself!

It’s been nearly 13 years since I lived in China and it’s incredible to see the pace of innovation since then and witness the technological advancements in the new energy landscape in both Beijing and Shanghai. 

Highlights from the trip included: a visit to HyperStrong, a leading provider of energy storage systems, which included a tour of their Beijing facility and meeting with their CEO, Dr. Jianhui Zhang , and leadership team. I enjoyed meeting with our talented Medium Voltage and Services #SEGreatPeople under the leadership of Shaofeng Xu. I had the pleasure of speaking at the ribbon cutting ceremony of our SBMV New VI workshop and meeting with the local team. Rounding out the visit included attending the signing of the agreement between Schneider Electric and Shuimu Mintal to develop a project simulating the integrated production of power-hydrogen-ammonia to support the acceleration of China’s green energy transition. Finally, I had the opportunity to speak with YiCai Media where I shared my perspective on the global energy transition and the role and responsibility of multi-national corporations like Schneider Electric. https://lnkd.in/dTzH6F4A

Big thank you to all our teams who supported on these activities!

Although it was a fully packed agenda, I did have the good fortune to tour the Great Wall of China with Gary Lawrence and Shaofeng Xu, which is itself an incredible example of engineering innovation!

It's one of my greatest joys to be one of the first to introduce our innovative new products to our field sales teams and valued resellers.

Preparing a high-production-value presentation from home can be challenging, but based on your feedback, I'm always motivated to push the boundaries of what is possible each and every time. This time, I've lined up some great demonstrations and will share some insights into our latest offerings, which will raise the bar again.

Over the next four weeks, we will run sixteen sessions. I will use this setup involving five cameras, a teleprompter, video switching and composition software, and a great presenter (humble brag!) to hopefully deliver a great presentation.

If you're a part of Logitech's sales team or one of our trusted partners, I invite you to register through Logitech University and see what I have in store for you.

It creates a deep understanding of the challenge…  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders’ minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders… how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent… how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within… saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

My response touched the following aspects:

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

#Proactive responsibility: Digital companies must set their own #responsibletechnology guardrails ahead of external mandates. As reference, this is the work my colleagues at Thoughtworks have done in collaboration with United Nations: https://lnkd.in/ex96xzHG

The future of #brand equity: In today's era, where technology augments every aspect of customer and employee experiences, responsible tech practices are the cornerstone of brand equity.

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry load’s carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now “Tide Cold Certified” – meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well – or even better – in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. It’s a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And we’re proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tide’s ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what they’re seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. I’m honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsoft’s LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a ‘whole-slide’ foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by ‘looking’ at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and we’re making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool that’ll help that human with a microscope ‘see’ things they didn’t realize were there.

I’m hugely proud of this work and grateful for the opportunity to support it.

We have posted information on how we are doing this, including the AI prompt, and you can share feedback through the form on this page: https://lnkd.in/ezVnvGiG 

While AI will play a role, our human judges will make the final decisions, ensuring a balanced and fair evaluation process. We're committed to learning from this experience and sharing our insights. Please reach out to me if you are interested in helping with the competition in any way.

Research has demonstrated that ""Data-driven initiatives have been shown to help VC firms reduce gender bias and make better, fairer investment decisions"" (https://lnkd.in/ecfqqgj3). Additionally, ""Machine learning models have already been proven to outperform human investors in deal screening"" (https://lnkd.in/exicBiTR), helping to identify high-potential startups more effectively. By incorporating AI into our evaluation process, we aim to support an objective selection of startups.

As a reminder, applications are due on May 26th.
