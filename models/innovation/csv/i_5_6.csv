Thanks to the efforts of over 2,000 team members and our partners at Epic, we're transforming the experience across our medical group, affiliated practices, clinics, pharmacies, and employer solutions with a transformed experience that will help improve the care we deliver to our patients.

This extensive, two-year journey has touched nearly every part of our organization, marking one of the most significant transformations in my career. I'm eager to see the positive changes as we settle into operational efficiency and our patients engage with new digital experiences.

One of the best things here is thinking long term. This has allowed us to make some bold moves in the past, like:
- Only focusing on B2B (working with Clients to offer Wellhub as a benefit to employees)
- Upgrading all subscribers to a new micro-services tech platform (that engages more people with wellbeing and increases check-ins)
- Investing in digital partnerships to complement the amazing offering we have with in person fitness and wellness partners!

And now, changing the name of the entire business to Wellhub. An obvious decision considering a multi-year perspective.

Got my welcome to Wellhub kit today!

It's day 1.

I'm feeling fresh to takle our mission to make every company a wellness company and help employees check-in with their wellbeing everyday.

As a co-founder of SCI Ventures, we’re on a mission to spark innovation and bridge the gap between lab research and making discoveries available to help restore functions for those with spinal cord injury and ultimately cure paralysis.

At Shepherd Center, we’re honored to come together with Wings for Life - Spinal Cord Research Foundation, Spinal Research, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, and Promobilia Foundation to support this single, first-of-its-kind, and truly game-changing investment vehicle. Through our combined network and knowledge, we plan to attract more capital to the SCI space by lowering the risk for additional investors from across the VC and healthcare industries. 

Through our combined network and knowledge, we hope to attract more capital, investment, and awareness to develop therapies that will help people begin again after spinal cord injury.

The United States is experiencing a rapidly shifting energy landscape due to the rising use of electricity, including electric vehicles and big tech data centers, which highlight the need for energy production and delivery to keep pace with growing customer demand. At The AES Corporation, we’re piloting innovative projects, such as LineVision's Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR), to better understand how we can deliver more energy on the grid as safely and efficiently as possible.
 
You can read the full article where I share more about AES Indiana’s LineVision pilot project, initial findings, and key learnings so that we can get more value from our existing grid assets with improved information. This pilot project reinforces that innovation is a crucial component for a greener, safer, and more equitable energy future.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,"What makes an innovative organisation? It's more than just actions, over words. It's in their willingness to take chances, in their courage to experiment, and in their constant state of curiosity. 

They see challenges as opportunities. Continuously improving, evolving and refusing to accept how they work today, as how they want to work tomorrow.

It's in their hunt for humility, an open arms approach to learning, the abolition of ego, and the warmth, respect and veracious hunger for the input of others.

Innovation cultures are forged from diverse and inclusive engagements involving unusual suspects. A melting pot of combustible people and materials that meet in sometimes bizarre and serendipitous ways to spark unexpected yet powerful reactions. It's a mindset, and it's in the DNA of the organisation, the particles and bonds, the synaptic connections, how they fuse and branch.

Innovative organisations are melting pots of divergent minds. They celebrate the value of difference. A little bit of the past, a pinch of the present, and a heavy hit of the future. Drucker was right when he said culture eats strategy for breakfast Paul. One could argue it eats it for lunch and dinner too.

For National Grid to have deployed Ideaonomy AI as part of their inaugural innovation day, a start up less than a year old, to a host of senior stakeholders speaks volumes.  We're proud to work with clients who have guts. Without guts, there will be no change. We can't play it safe and still expect to win.

Big thanks Ben, David, Sander, Chris, Gerard, Linda, Caroline, Oli, Phillipa, Sarah, Mark, Jonathan, Paula, Nora, Stephen, Matthew.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkpark/,"Our most recent R&D town hall meeting this quarter was a fantastic opportunity to celebrate our collective achievements and welcome new faces to the team.

The highlight was officially welcoming the Ventiv team to the Riskonnect family. Although we’ve had many connects over the past month, this was the first quarterly meeting with those joining our team from Ventiv. With team members now spanning five geographies, our combined expertise and technology strength promise an exciting future with great potential to innovate and redefine risk management as we integrate into a single platform to offer ‘Risk under one roof’ to customers worldwide.  Welcome Michael Hamann, Gaurav Tandon, Poornima Raj, Narayanan Neelakantan, Vishal Yadav, SHARAD G. and the entire Ventiv R&D team!

Our journey of product innovation is also something we are proud of as a team. Work has already begun on developing new ways to address IT Risk Management. That’s not all… The AI Innovation Lab has been busy delivering three proof-of-concept projects, two of which were showcased at the RIMS (Risk and Insurance Management Society, Inc.)/Risk World conference! These advancements are just part of our journey to continue to offer AI’s offerings in the areas of Embedded Decision Support, Enhanced Workflow and Efficiency, and Practical Innovation.  Thank you Kathryn Carlson for covering our Product vision at the town hall!

We also congratulated colleagues who earned promotions through their hard work and commitment. Our accomplishments are a testament to what we can achieve together, and a result of our team philosophy with ""spark"" and ""community"" as key reminders - while we continue to innovate, collaborate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
