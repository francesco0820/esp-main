"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now. 


Grateful, Thankful, and Blessed. ",Not Innovation,0

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not Innovation,0
"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question. Pierce denial. Pierce lies. Pierce the surface.hashtag#emotionalintelligencehashtag#purposehashtag#iqeqtqThis picture is a fair representation of how I look when I receive compliments. A lot happy.

"This was the start of Spotify.$60B of market cap today, just a wireframe at the start.""We started building the product. That's always what came first for us."" Daniel EkLet's rewind to get the full context: (As Daniel told Stockholm Tech Fest 2015)2002Daniel had the idea of Spotify when he experienced the magic of Napster. He loved the concept but hated the business model. He felt, ""Holy shit, this is what I want to do."" The timing just wasn't right. 2006Daniel and his co-founder Martin Lorentzon both had just sold their prior companies. They were figuring out what to build next. They eventually agreed there was a compelling opportunity to make Napster with the right business model.They started the company with a bunch of people at the KTH Royal Tech Institute in Stockholm. And they communicated a simple vision: ""Imagine having all the world's music in your iTunes library."" 2007One of the people making that vision a reality was lead designer Rasmuss Anderson (who has since gone on to also help design the first version of Figma). Working closely with the team, he created this iconic wireframe that defined the Spotify user experience:1. Launch app2. Login to spotify3. Personalize your homepage experience4. Discover & play unlimited musicBut the Spotify idea didn't start out this perfect. They iterated and iterated until they had something that would not just work, but delight users. The result is these early interactions still define the app we see today.2008After two years of iterating on the product, Spotify actually launched in Europe. The team waited until they could ""provide the best possible service."" And the result was wildfire. Spotify experienced hockey stick growth in Europe, went global in 2011, and public in 2018. The key lesson? Iterating on wireframes was done extensively before they ever wrote any code. This is a great takeaway for product builders of all types:Don't skip your wireframes!","Innovation,User Experience",1

"For decades, the only mantra for the solar industry was to relentlessly drive the costs of the panel down, down, down. We were so successful that, today, the panel is not the biggest cost driver for solar deployments. For utility-scale, land and labor are often larger cost components. For residential rooftops, believe it or not, marketing and customer acquisition costs are often the largest expense. Perovskite-based tandems add value by tackling land and labor costs, greatly impacting the total cost of ownership (TCO). Since our panels can be 25-40% more efficient than conventional panels, that means we can save 25-40% of land and labor costs, often more than the entire cost of the panel itself!

" There's an emerging trend in business: CISOs are expanding into technology.Rohan Amin now leads Product, Design, and Data & Analytics at Chase.Brian Minick now leads Technology and Information at Fifth Third Bank. Craig Froelich now leads Technology at Bank of America.I'm excited to join the ranks of these (and other) great leaders as my role has expanded to Chief Technology Officer at Equifax. Here's why I think this trend makes sense. A strong CTO:... Is immersed in the entirety of the business... Drives innovation and manages risk... Is passionate about products and services...

"The growing acceptance of generative AI among U.S. doctors marks a significant shift, especially considering their traditional reluctance toward adopting new technologies. This shift underscores the potential benefits perceived by physicians, such as improved patient interactions and time savings. However, despite their openness, physicians remain cautious, emphasizing the importance of transparency regarding data sources and the need for professional oversight. The findings below also reveal a gap in organizational readiness, with many physicians indicating a lack of guidelines for using GenAI within their institutions.

"Falling in love with the problem, before jumping into solutions, helps you go slow to go fast. It creates a deep understanding of the challenge...  the parts you need to decompose before you need to put them back together. If it was easy, it would have been solved already. Analytics Unite 2024 brought together business, data and technology leaders shaping Fortune 500 with data and AI. Here are a few of the problems in leaders minds from our discussions:

#1. AI is changing and shaping businesses fast, how to adapt strategy, stay current, where to invest time and energy for max returns and managed risk. 

#2. How to attract and retain top talent, AI/Ml engineers, senior leaders... how to manage cycles shortening and create an atmosphere that welcomes diverse talent... how to grow strategic partnerships

#3. How to lead change where there is more urgency than ever, and companies putting data & AI at work are leaping forward faster, while at large companies there is more work to be done

#4. Driving significant cost savings and improving operations, while establishing a strategic innovation and transformation agenda, finding more and more ways to solve for investments from within... saving to reinvest

#5. How to escape gravity of pilots/POCs to build great products and experiences that stick and make a scaled impact to top and bottom line

"Is your company well-positioned to take advantage of the coming AI wave?

There's a distinction between companies that experiment with AI, those that deploy AI for specific tasks, and companies that are truly AI-centered. 

Understanding this difference can position your company for success when Enterprise AI truly gets going. 

Let's look at what an AI-enabled company looks like versus an AI-centered company. 

AI-Enabled Company 

	Leadership team understands the benefits of embedding AI in business processes and are keenly aware of what their competition is (or is not) doing around AI enablement.

	Has staff trained on AI technologies and implementation methodologies.

	Identified processes that can be automated with little disruption to overall business. 

For example: 

Automate repetitive tasks like data entry and lead scoring (machine learning), or AI-powered sales forecasting and opportunity management tools. Chatbots for basic customer service inquiries. 

AI-Centered Company 

	An evolved version of the AI-enabled company, which has a comprehensive AI strategy and leadership in place.

	Has multiple core business processes AI-enabled, and a plan to integrate AI into operational decision-making within multiple departments like logistics, supply chain, inventory, marketing, sales, customer support, etc.

	Has a change management program and employee re-education program to help up-level their knowledge to incorporate AI. 

AI is fast becoming a core driver of innovation, growth and competitive advantage.

#Regulation is necessary: AI's transformative impact on our lives and businesses makes oversight inevitable and essential as a guardrail to accelerate responsible innovation. 

Regulation will invariably #lag: By its nature, and historically, regulation trails innovation. We innovate first, we legislate after.

#Proactive responsibility: Digital companies must set their own #responsibletechnology guardrails ahead of external mandates. As reference, this is the work my colleagues at Thoughtworks have done in collaboration with United Nations: https://lnkd.in/ex96xzHG

"One of Procter & Gamble's strategic priorities is to lead with deep consumer insights, which help us deliver breakthrough innovations and superior products that better peoples everyday lives. 

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry loads carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now Tide Cold Certified  meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well  or even better  in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. Its a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And were proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tides ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

"As we envision the future of gene editing, St. Jude is committed to investing in top-tier technologies to better understand the molecular processes of rearranging the genome in translational studies. The St. Jude Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) Center in the Department of Structural Biology enables researchers to visualize intricate biological macromolecules with unprecedented detail and clarity.   It is staffed by expert scientists who provide extensive support and training to investigators at all levels and over the complete workflow for single-particle cryo-EM, from sample preparation to data collection, image processing, 3D reconstruction and modeling. 

Liz Kellogg, PhD, and her team are now utilizing a state-of-the-art microscope that is equipped with a cold FEG as an electron source, a SelectrisX energy filter and a Falcon 4i camera. These technologies will primarily be used for Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET), which seeks to understand the inner workings of cells by visualizing intricate biological structures with advanced image processing. 

Having access to one of the best microscopes in the country enables our lab to gain deeper insights into the architecture and organization of genomes says Kellogg. 

This is just the beginning for the Kellogg lab as they seek to understand the molecular processes capable of rearranging the genome and potentially harnessing these processes in translational studies.","Innovation,Digital Transformation",1
"Ahead of todays Investor Day, AstraZeneca has just announced a bold ambition to deliver $80bn in Total Revenue by 2030, up from around $45bn in 2023. I am confident that we have the right strategy, people and governance in place to deliver on this ambition. 

With significant growth across our existing oncology, biopharmaceuticals and rare disease portfolios, and our exciting pipeline expected to launch 20 new medicines for patients by 2030, we are entering a new era of growth. And, with our continued investment in disruptive innovation, we are committed to delivering sustained growth post 2030. I am also proud that we continue to decouple carbon emissions from revenue growth. 

Since beginning my role as Chair just over a year ago, I have continued to be inspired by the passion and creativity of our employees that have made this ambition possible  from our scientists to our commercial, operations, and enabling units teams across the globe  who are united by our values and purpose - to push the boundaries of science to deliver life changing medicines.

"Usually when I'm hiking with a fascinating person, I'm going to a large open space preserve with many miles of trails. This time I met Omar Tawakol at Cuesta Park in Mountain View, which looks small on the map. But because it has a section of rustic trails, you still feel like you are getting away from the 'burbs. The conversation with Omar also helped transport us, as he laid out the opportunity in front of Rembrand (hint: it's massive). The company uses AI to insert brands into video. This used to be called product placement, and was a cumbersome process that limited the market. Rembrand's biggest challenge is to remove this friction and unshackle the TAM. It's a reminder that businesses that scale often need to focus on removing friction for their customers.

Can Rembrand and Omar do it? Well, if you know Omar, former Founder/CEO of BlueKai (acquired by Oracle) and Voicea (acquired by Cisco), you know he's a strong leader, and you know he has a plan. I'm betting on Omar!","Innovation,AI/Machine Learning",1

"Today marks a career highlight for me. 

For the last 130 years, modern anatomic pathology has relied on the ability of a human to look at something under a microscope and understand what theyre seeing. Getting AI to help with this has been hard, in part because of the gigantic amount of information in a typical pathology slide, which could contain a billion pixels. Im honored to have sponsored a research team at Providence, Microsoft and the University of Washington who published a major breakthrough today in the journal Nature. They cracked the computational challenge of modeling whole pathology slides using an adaptation of Microsofts LongNet, which allows for long-context modeling. This allowed the team to develop a whole-slide foundation model for digital pathology, pretrained on 1.3 billion pathology images. This new model is able to discern between different types of cancer, and even determine which mutations are present in a cancer, just by looking at a slide.

This foundation model is called Prov-GigaPath, and were making it open access for researchers. 

The medical community finally has an AI tool thatll help that human with a microscope see things they didnt realize were there.

Im hugely proud of this work and grateful for the opportunity to support it.
