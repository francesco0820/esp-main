"A very big â€˜thank youâ€™ to Christine Winoto, Richard Lungen, HC9 Ventures, and the team at the UCSF Rosenman Institute for inviting me to moderate a panel on â€œCooking Up New Payment Modelsâ€ in healthcare.
I was incredibly fortunate to have a star-studded panel of Ali Khan, MD, MPP, Beth Andersen, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Romilla Batra, MD, MBA, which enabled us to cover a wide range of approaches to the topic of paymentâ€”and how various payment modelsâ€”affect prices and patient care across both government and private healthcare.
Whatâ€™s clear is that all of us on all sides of the healthcare marketâ€”payers, providers, employers, regulatorsâ€”can learn a lot from each other and need to act in a more coordinated fashion. Healthcare (and how much it costs) impacts each and every one of us, directly and indirectly, and we canâ€™t continue reimbursing care in one part of the market (e.g., Medicare) without thoroughly thinking through the implications in other parts of the market (e.g., employer-sponsored healthcare).

"Today we reported Elasticâ€™s Q2 earnings results. Our outlook remains strong, and Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities ahead. Iâ€™d like to highlight three key trends weâ€™re seeing in our business:
- Generative AI continues to drive a resurgence of excitement around enterprise search. Our Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE) provides the most comprehensive and enterprise-ready platform for use cases across semantic search, vector search, and hybrid search.
- Customers are looking to consolidate onto the Elastic platform for multiple use cases as they seek ways to lower their total spend without sacrificing innovation. More customers are choosing us over incumbent solutions for observability and security, helping them save on their overall IT spend while gaining even greater value through our many innovations.
- Continued improvements helped drive cloud revenue growth. Customers are continuing to stay focused on costs, but they've generally optimized their Elastic deployments and are now focused on driving new workloads to Elastic. This is an area where we continue to help our customers get the most out of Elastic. Our customer-centric approach drives improved customer satisfaction and engagement, and increased consumption over time.
Enabling everyone to find the answers that matter. From all data, in real time, at scale. That is our mission. At a time when companies are looking for ways to reduce costs and gain efficiencies without sacrificing innovation, especially around Generative AI, Elasticâ€™s search analytics platform is becoming the natural choice for businesses.",Cost management / reduction / optimization

"Matthew Prince is the Co-Founder and CEO of Cloudflare. In the episode, we discuss fascinating anecdotes from Cloudflareâ€™s (um) eclectic early customers, the founding teamâ€™s dynamics, and the best lessons he has for entrepreneurs from building Cloudflare to a $20B public company.
On choosing a strong founding team:
Matthew previously started a company with his best friends, and their similarities led to constant fights and problems. He realized the entrepreneurial dream isnâ€™t about starting something with your buddies but rather with diverse people who have different skills than you. Matthew emphasizes, â€œif you need to talk about how you divide responsibilities among a founding team, it means you have the wrong founding team.â€
On making tough decisions:
In the early days of Cloudflare, the team would constantly ask themselves â€œif Cloudflare ran the entire Internet, What would the right decision be?â€ The question pushed them to make technical decisions that allowed Cloudflare to scale, and it helped with hiring and conflict resolution. The mindset worked, as roughly 20% of the internetâ€™s traffic flows through Cloudflare today.
On ignoring revenue
Cloudflare ignored revenue metrics for the four years of the companyâ€™s life. Instead, the team focused on reducing costs and signing up as many customers as possible. They gathered tons of data from their strange early customers (including a slew of Turkish escorts and other risque websites). Eventually, Cloudflare shifted their focus toward revenue, but only when they started to sign up enterprise customers that would drive the revenue story further.
Overall, an unfiltered conversation about the journey of building Cloudflare into the powerhouse it is today.

"August 14 may be #FinancialAwarenessDay, but there rarely goes a day in my life where Iâ€™m not talking about, in some way or another, the importance of financial health â€” especially for women.
We built Ellevest because we believe that your financial health is connected intrinsically with your overall health. Itâ€™s not just about dollars and cents â€” itâ€™s about having control over your life, your choices, and your future.
Deciding you want to take control of your money is the easy part. The tricky part can be figuring out how. It starts with establishing an essential set of habits and practices that create the lasting financial security and stability you need to design, build, and live the life you want. That includes checking in on your finances regularly, budgeting for spending *and* debt, investing a part of every paycheck, keeping a healthy emergency fund, and having an overall financial plan in place.
What difference does this all make?
Research shows that people with a financial plan have 3x the net worth of those who donâ€™t. Triple the wealth!
And for women, the difference is compounded â€” because we start out with less than men, have fewer financial opportunities than men, and end up with less than men.
These gender gaps can be crippling: Women are more likely to end up in poverty in retirement than men.
So if you donâ€™t feel in control of your finances yet, todayâ€™s a good day to start. Start investing, start budgeting, start planning â€” and if you need some expert help â€¦ well, you know where to go:
