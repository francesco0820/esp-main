"On April 1, the New York State Department of Health is due to ""carve out"" the pharmacy benefit from Medicaid managed care, shifting to a fee-for-service model purporting to increase savings through lower pharmacy costs. However, the proposed change will cause unnecessary harm to New York's most vulnerable populations, including those diagnosed with HIV, while failing to deliver the hoped-for-savings. This action will lead to massive confusion, gaps in medication access and adherence and fewer services and supports from the community-based safety net providers that serve them.
I joined Dr. Hany Abdelaal and Doug Wirth to share why New York State must keep Medicaid's pharmacy benefits. Read more in New York Daily News: https://lnkd.in/exdU42Y3

"I am absolutely thrilled to share that Intel Corporation has selected WrocAaw, Poland, as the planned site of a new, state-of-the-art semiconductor assembly/test facility.
Semiconductor manufacturing that is too concentrated in any one region can cause rapid and extraordinary disruption that leads to a variety of shortages. The creation of more resilient systems without single points of collapse is critical. Nothing should be reliant on a single port "" whether in the U.S., Europe, or Asia.
Intel welcomes and strongly supports the EU Chips Act package and its ambition to develop a more geographically diversified, sustainable, and resilient semiconductor supply chain. Intel is one of a handful of global companies that can bring leading-edge and sustainable chips technology to Europe! #IntelEurope

"Fantastic article by Jim Campbell, AvidXchange, Inc.'s Construction Business Line Executive, about how AP automation can strengthen key relationships in the construction industry. Cash flow is king in the construction business, especially for subcontractors and smaller companies that are buying materials earlier than ever before due to ongoing supply chain problems. The right AP automation solution streamlines invoicing and payment, reducing the collective burden for general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. Timely payments build goodwill, keep the cash flowing, and get projects completed on time. #APautomation #AvidXfactor #construction",Cost Reduction,1,0

"August 14 may be #FinancialAwarenessDay, but there rarely goes a day in my life where I'm not talking about, in some way or another, the importance of financial health "" especially for women.
We built Ellevest because we believe that your financial health is connected intrinsically with your overall health. It's not just about dollars and cents "" it's about having control over your life, your choices, and your future.
Deciding you want to take control of your money is the easy part. The tricky part can be figuring out how. It starts with establishing an essential set of habits and practices that create the lasting financial security and stability you need to design, build, and live the life you want. That includes checking in on your finances regularly, budgeting for spending *and* debt, investing a part of every paycheck, keeping a healthy emergency fund, and having an overall financial plan in place.
What difference does this all make?
Research shows that people with a financial plan have 3x the net worth of those who don't. Triple the wealth!
And for women, the difference is compounded "" because we start out with less than men, have fewer financial opportunities than men, and end up with less than men.
These gender gaps can be crippling: Women are more likely to end up in poverty in retirement than men.
So if you don't feel in control of your finances yet, today's a good day to start. Start investing, start budgeting, start planning "" and if you need some expert help "" well, you know where to go:
