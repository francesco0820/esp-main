"Create your legacy! That was the theme at our event celebrating #HispanicHeritageMonth. Every year, Pfizerâ€™s Latino Community Colleague Resource Group hosts a summit that brings together Pfizer colleagues from all over the world as well as professionals from different industries to celebrate their heritage, and share their stories and experiences as Latino professionals. Special thanks to my colleagues Mia Ortiz and Melissa Barreto for organizing this incredible event.
This yearâ€™s theme really got me thinking about what that wordâ€”â€œlegacyâ€â€”means. To me, legacy is about blazing a positive and hopefully transformative path that can inspire others to succeed. Pfizer has a legacy: We have a 175-year history of innovating for patientsâ€”from helping to pioneer large-scale penicillin manufacturing during World War II, to developing vaccines that have helped eradicate devastating diseases. Our legacy has changed the lives of billions of people.
Hispanic Heritage Month is a special time in the US that celebrates the historic independence of several Latin American countries. The many men and women who fought for their countriesâ€™ independence left a legacy that continues to inspire to this day. I hope to build a legacy as well, one that embodies the four values we hold dear at Pfizer: courage, excellence, equity, and joy.

"Today at MIT Media Lab, I shared a joke that introduces a section in the sci-fi tale Ready Player One. ""I'm not crazy about reality, but it's still the only place to get a decent meal.""
Hereâ€™s why I think this quote is timely. The #metaverse came to the gaming world 20 years ago. Two years ago, we saw the metaverse at the forefront of tech industry headlines.
We heard about all of the emerging consumer and IT applications. Now, #AI has taken center stage. The world is buzzing about the potential disruption these emerging and converging digital tools will bring.
But what I really see happening now with the metaverse is some refocusing. Thereâ€™s a realization that people arenâ€™t looking to escape reality; theyâ€™re looking for virtual environments and experiences that enable them to improve this real world we live in.
And this is a perspective that really energizes us as a focused technology company that combines the real and the digital worlds. We see this value proposition applying to market segment after market segment. And now weâ€™re embedding this strategy into what we call the #IndustrialMetaverse, which weâ€™re now working to advance with partners such as NVIDIA.
Think about everything we learned during the pandemic about the need for more resilient supply chains and more localized #manufacturing. The industrial metaverse will provide us with what we need: the ability to invent anywhere and to transmit our creativity everywhere.",Supply chain

"Today is National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, a day to remember all who have been lost to this devastating epidemic and to increase awareness of this growing threat to all families. Fentanyl is now the #1 cause of death in the U.S. among adults younger than 45 years old. On June 1, this became more than a statistic to us when our 31-year-old son Connor died from fentanyl poisoning. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine. It is a legitimate pharmaceutical used as an anesthetic during surgery and as an analgesic for the treatment of breakthrough pain. However, because it is inexpensive to manufacture and highly addictive, Mexican drug cartels using Chinese supplied precursor chemicals are adding fentanyl to virtually all illicitly supplied drugs, including counterfeit prescription medicines. Sometimes users are aware they are taking fentanyl, but often they are not. Because of poor quality control, any one pill can include a lethal doseâ€¦thus the DEAâ€™s awareness campaign: â€œOne pill can kill.â€
My son was recently married, had a successful career, was a leader of teams, with a large support group of loving family and friends, and he was a long-time sufferer of chronic pain stemming from sports injuries. He thought he was getting Oxycontin from someone he knew, but one of the pills was laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl that likely killed him instantly. Doctors, pilots, attorneys, teachers, teenagers, and others from all demographic and socioeconomic groups taking what they believe to be Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, or Adderall. Dying from fentanyl poisoning.
There are no easy answers, and it will get worse before it gets better. The addictive power and profit motive too great. It is a war being waged against us that is costing billions of dollars and killing some of our best and brightest. The only control most of us have over an uncontrollable situation is to be prepared to save someoneâ€™s life. Nalaxone (Narcan) is a cheap and now widely available drug that can be easily administered to someone in distress or dying from any opioid overdose â€“ including fentanyl. Itâ€™s a cheap, easy-to-use, miracle antidote. But you have to have it within reach. 911 is too late. Naloxone will soon be available OTC. Put one in your car, office, or briefcase/purse. Or all three. Think of it as like an AED, except smaller, cheaper, easier, and more effective. And something you are more likely to use, statistically. You may think there is no need to have one, that you donâ€™t know anybody at risk, but neither did I.
Given the rapid growth in opioid deaths, there are two groups of people in the U.S. nowâ€¦those who know someone who has died from an opioid overdose and those who will. You can potentially save someoneâ€™s life by being preparedâ€¦buy them some time to figure it out, get the help they need. And maybe spare another parent the excruciating pain of losing a child.",MISC

An OMS can improve the efficiency and accuracy of your order processing, which will enhance customer satisfaction and increase overall revenue. Here's how:
- Evaluate needs - Determine your business requirements, such as order volumes and product types
- Choose the right OMS - Select a system that meets your needs, considering factors like scalability and integration capabilities
- Integration - Connect the OMS with existing systems, such as e-commerce platforms and inventory management
- Monitor and optimize - Review OMS performance and make adjustments as needed

Above all, our inspiration comes from listening to the voice of the athlete. And this year, weâ€™re deeply honored to open our Impact Report with a letter from six defining Nike athletes who continue to push us forward.
To Serena, Shelly-Ann, Megan, Li Na, Bebe, and Ada â€” thank you for raising your voices. And thank you, from all of us at Nike, for inspiring us to think even bigger about the change we can create.

"What a tremendous experience to be at #CGI2023 and discuss the ideas, moments and endeavors that spark curiosity, wonder and awe. For me, those feelings are ignited by Pfizerâ€™s relentless commitment to advancing human health.
Three years ago, we made the impossible possible by producing a vaccine for COVID-19 in just nine months. I saw firsthand the passion, dedication and commitment of my talented colleagues as they took on an unprecedented health challenge and found a solution for it. It is with that same spirit that we now tackle other major health issues.
Weâ€™re not going to do this alone. Weâ€™re going to work with partners, suppliers, governments, institutions, and most importantly, our patients, to improve global health. But make no mistakeâ€”weâ€™re all in, and weâ€™re determined to win the battle against disease.",Health outcomes
"In the year ahead, trade disruption, customs valuation, transfer pricing and the interplay between trade policy and the environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda will continue to influence the trade policies of governments and the trade strategies of corporations in 2023 and beyond.
The latest article by our EY global trade team analyzes how, in the face of this continued geopolitical uncertainty, these factors create new challenges but also opportunities for companies worldwide, elevating trade and supply chain issues to the boardroom, and putting the trade function in the spotlight as never before.

"Breaking news! In todayâ€™s edition of The New York Times, journalist Cade Metz details how Vectara is helping to solve the fundamental challenge in Generative AI: how often and severely do chatbots hallucinate?
Drawing extensively from Vectaraâ€™s research for our new Hallucination Evaluation Model and conversations with CEO Amr Awadallah and AI scientist Simon Hughes, PhD, the article explains why large language models veer from the truth and how Vectara was able to measure and rank the performance of popular systems like GPT-4 and Llama 2.

"With every new technology wave, investors have always been eager to back the so-called â€œpicks and shovels'' of the moment. Today, we see this in the valuations of NVIDIA and foundational models.
But, while everyone else rushes to back the enablers, someone still needs to find gold. In my new role as GP at Greylock, I want to back founders who are willing to take the risk to build enduring, AI-enabled products that will change how people work and live.
I believe thereâ€™s tremendous value to be built by product builders who can successfully put the power of AI into products that people love.
Of course there are plenty of detractors who believe startups donâ€™t have a chance at this layer â€“ incumbents own the data and distribution, and access to LLMs is both commoditized and fraught with platform risk. There will likely be many casualties of companies where an API call to OpenAI isnâ€™t sufficient to build lasting value.
Iâ€™ve put forth my thesis for the next wave of AI-first products in a new post, which you can read in its entirety at the bottom. Here are the main takeaways.
As I see it, these are the three largest opportunities for founders to build AI-first companies:
AI-first networks & marketplaces
For all networks (including social networks and marketplaces), AI challenges many of our initial assumptions. This is creating a new arms race to build the next AI-first network.
Re-defining enterprise software categories
Platform shifts are often significant enough that it creates a window to re-build large categories of software.The best opportunities for start-ups attacking large software categories comes from finding angles where incumbents canâ€™t compete.
Co-Pilot for services
I believe the best opportunities for AI co-pilots are â€œbrandedâ€ sales people, like wealth managers, insurance brokers, and mortgage brokers. Their role involves a lot of text- based coordination, they work across multiple apps, and the ROI of increased efficiency is tangible.
Iâ€™ve gone into much more detail in my post below. If you are a founder building in this area (or even just starting to think about it) please get in touch.
Special thanks to Keith Peiris, Henri Liriani, CristÃ³bal Valenzuela, Sam Lessin (the resident devil's advocate), Blake Barnes, Will Ruben, Mike Duboe, christine kim, Saam Motamedi, and Jacob Andreou for their thought leadership in this space.

"Just recently, Stanford University released its AI Index Report for this year.
The most interesting points from my perspective:
- Companies that are already using AI are benefiting significantly (e.g. cost decreases and revenue increases)
- AI is both helping and harming the environment (e.g. it makes processes more energy efficient, but also requires energy itself)
- The number of incidents concerning the misuse of AI is rapidly rising (e.g. deepfakes)
- Interest in AI is increasing, not least among politicians and legislators
For me, the development and use of AI solutions go hand in hand with responsibility. This means, for example, thinking about sustainability when developing AI solutions, and focusing on the benefits for - and safety of - the people using it.
Achieving this requires a careful balance between enabling technological process and establishing rules based on common values. After all, AI opens up a new way of doing business with entirely new business models. It can help make businesses more agile, supply chains more resilient, and economies more sustainable.
I would like to see Europe focus on these opportunities. By overregulating out of fear of the potential risks, we also face the very real possibility of losing startups and investors, for example.
In addition to the existing regulations that apply already, the upcoming EU AI Act should only regulate AI applications that pose significant risk to the health, safety, and fundamental rights of citizens. I hope that the vote in the European Parliament will not deviate from a risk-based approach.
Finally, I would like to encourage governments to agree on global principles and standards for the use of safe and trustworthy AI. Ultimately, the biggest risk would be to stifle opportunities before they can blossom.",Regulation/Legislation

"What a year! And what an honor to reflect on one of the top years in company history and perhaps the best year ever for Siemens USA.
Our U.S. market now represents nearly a quarter of Siemensâ€™ global revenue. And in 2022, we produced major results, with strong growth in orders and record backlogs. Congratulations to Ruth, Raj, Del, Marc and their teams for this outstanding business performance and continued success.
We won major accolades, like being named â€œWorld Changing Company of the Yearâ€ by Fast Company, who recognized that we are doing just that with digitalization.
We hit major milestones, including our 175th anniversary as a company and the launch of our new digital business platform, #SiemensXcelerator, which is giving customers and partners the tools to accelerate their digital transformation and sustainability journeys.
Itâ€™s always gratifying to see the talent, hard work and dedication of our 45,000-strong team represented in this way. Weâ€™re producing results because we are perfectly suited to this moment for transforming industry, infrastructure, healthcare and mobility.
Looking back on 2022, thereâ€™s a lot to be proud of and a lot to build on in 2023. But even more important than our annual wins, however extraordinary, is the enduring sense of purpose that drives us forward as a company. To my LinkedIn followers: I wish you and your families a restful holiday season and a Happy New Year!",MISC

"May is a good month, not only because of the generous bank holidays (which is nice, donâ€™t get me wrong), but also because it's a month when colleagues across Marsh McLennan businesses unify under Global Volunteering Month. It's always fantastic to see Oliver Wyman colleagues come together for the causes they are passionate about.
Looking after the community we live in is important to all of us at Oliver Wyman. While in the London office, I took the opportunity to join a team for an enthusiastic session of litter picking. To be honest I worried that litter picking was a bit performative, lacking intensity or high impact. But when we got out there and I suddenly had to focus on the debris â€“ mostly cigarette butts - that my brain normally filters out, it felt pretty good; and joining this crew was even better. I'm proud of all Oliver Wyman colleagues who are contributing this month in big and small ways.
Thanks to my fellow litter pickers: Princella, Amber, Prateek, Kyle, Nobel, and Lauren for the great company.
