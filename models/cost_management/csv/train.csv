"Today is National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, a day to remember all who have been lost to this devastating epidemic and to increase awareness of this growing threat to all families. Fentanyl is now the #1 cause of death in the U.S. among adults younger than 45 years old. On June 1, this became more than a statistic to us when our 31-year-old son Connor died from fentanyl poisoning. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine. It is a legitimate pharmaceutical used as an anesthetic during surgery and as an analgesic for the treatment of breakthrough pain. However, because it is inexpensive to manufacture and highly addictive, Mexican drug cartels using Chinese supplied precursor chemicals are adding fentanyl to virtually all illicitly supplied drugs, including counterfeit prescription medicines. Sometimes users are aware they are taking fentanyl, but often they are not. Because of poor quality control, any one pill can include a lethal dose""thus the DEA's awareness campaign: ""One pill can kill.""
My son was recently married, had a successful career, was a leader of teams, with a large support group of loving family and friends, and he was a long-time sufferer of chronic pain stemming from sports injuries. He thought he was getting Oxycontin from someone he knew, but one of the pills was laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl that likely killed him instantly. Doctors, pilots, attorneys, teachers, teenagers, and others from all demographic and socioeconomic groups taking what they believe to be Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, or Adderall. Dying from fentanyl poisoning.
There are no easy answers, and it will get worse before it gets better. The addictive power and profit motive too great. It is a war being waged against us that is costing billions of dollars and killing some of our best and brightest. The only control most of us have over an uncontrollable situation is to be prepared to save someone's life. Nalaxone (Narcan) is a cheap and now widely available drug that can be easily administered to someone in distress or dying from any opioid overdose "" including fentanyl. It's a cheap, easy-to-use, miracle antidote. But you have to have it within reach. 911 is too late. Naloxone will soon be available OTC. Put one in your car, office, or briefcase/purse. Or all three. Think of it as like an AED, except smaller, cheaper, easier, and more effective. And something you are more likely to use, statistically. You may think there is no need to have one, that you don't know anybody at risk, but neither did I.
Given the rapid growth in opioid deaths, there are two groups of people in the U.S. now""those who know someone who has died from an opioid overdose and those who will. You can potentially save someone's life by being prepared""buy them some time to figure it out, get the help they need. And maybe spare another parent the excruciating pain of losing a child.",MISC
"On April 1, the New York State Department of Health is due to ""carve out"" the pharmacy benefit from Medicaid managed care, shifting to a fee-for-service model purporting to increase savings through lower pharmacy costs. However, the proposed change will cause unnecessary harm to New York's most vulnerable populations, including those diagnosed with HIV, while failing to deliver the hoped-for-savings. This action will lead to massive confusion, gaps in medication access and adherence and fewer services and supports from the community-based safety net providers that serve them.

"Just recently, Stanford University released its AI Index Report for this year.
The most interesting points from my perspective:
- Companies that are already using AI are benefiting significantly (e.g. cost decreases and revenue increases)
- AI is both helping and harming the environment (e.g. it makes processes more energy efficient, but also requires energy itself)
- The number of incidents concerning the misuse of AI is rapidly rising (e.g. deepfakes)
- Interest in AI is increasing, not least among politicians and legislators
For me, the development and use of AI solutions go hand in hand with responsibility. This means, for example, thinking about sustainability when developing AI solutions, and focusing on the benefits for - and safety of - the people using it.
Achieving this requires a careful balance between enabling technological process and establishing rules based on common values. After all, AI opens up a new way of doing business with entirely new business models. It can help make businesses more agile, supply chains more resilient, and economies more sustainable.
I would like to see Europe focus on these opportunities. By overregulating out of fear of the potential risks, we also face the very real possibility of losing startups and investors, for example.
In addition to the existing regulations that apply already, the upcoming EU AI Act should only regulate AI applications that pose significant risk to the health, safety, and fundamental rights of citizens. I hope that the vote in the European Parliament will not deviate from a risk-based approach.
Finally, I would like to encourage governments to agree on global principles and standards for the use of safe and trustworthy AI. Ultimately, the biggest risk would be to stifle opportunities before they can blossom.",Regulation/Legislation

"With every new technology wave, investors have always been eager to back the so-called ""picks and shovels'' of the moment. Today, we see this in the valuations of NVIDIA and foundational models.
But, while everyone else rushes to back the enablers, someone still needs to find gold. In my new role as GP at Greylock, I want to back founders who are willing to take the risk to build enduring, AI-enabled products that will change how people work and live.
I believe there's tremendous value to be built by product builders who can successfully put the power of AI into products that people love.
Of course there are plenty of detractors who believe startups don't have a chance at this layer "" incumbents own the data and distribution, and access to LLMs is both commoditized and fraught with platform risk. There will likely be many casualties of companies where an API call to OpenAI isn't sufficient to build lasting value.
I've put forth my thesis for the next wave of AI-first products in a new post, which you can read in its entirety at the bottom. Here are the main takeaways.
As I see it, these are the three largest opportunities for founders to build AI-first companies:
AI-first networks & marketplaces
For all networks (including social networks and marketplaces), AI challenges many of our initial assumptions. This is creating a new arms race to build the next AI-first network.
Re-defining enterprise software categories
Platform shifts are often significant enough that it creates a window to re-build large categories of software.The best opportunities for start-ups attacking large software categories comes from finding angles where incumbents can't compete.
Co-Pilot for services
I believe the best opportunities for AI co-pilots are ""branded"" sales people, like wealth managers, insurance brokers, and mortgage brokers. Their role involves a lot of text- based coordination, they work across multiple apps, and the ROI of increased efficiency is tangible.
I've gone into much more detail in my post below. If you are a founder building in this area (or even just starting to think about it) please get in touch.

"An OMS, or Order Management System, is a software solution that streamlines and automates the various stages of an order's lifecycle, from order placement to fulfillment and delivery. It enables businesses to efficiently manage orders from multiple channels, such as e-commerce platforms, physical stores, and marketplaces, while also integrating with other essential systems such as inventory management, warehouse management, and customer relationship management.
An OMS can improve the efficiency and accuracy of your order processing, which will enhance customer satisfaction and increase overall revenue. Here's how:
- Evaluate needs - Determine your business requirements, such as order volumes and product types
- Choose the right OMS - Select a system that meets your needs, considering factors like scalability and integration capabilities
- Integration - Connect the OMS with existing systems, such as e-commerce platforms and inventory management
- Monitor and optimize - Review OMS performance and make adjustments as needed
Does your company have an integrated OMS in your ERP or a standalone solution?

Here's why I think this quote is timely. The #metaverse came to the gaming world 20 years ago. Two years ago, we saw the metaverse at the forefront of tech industry headlines.
We heard about all of the emerging consumer and IT applications. Now, #AI has taken center stage. The world is buzzing about the potential disruption these emerging and converging digital tools will bring.
But what I really see happening now with the metaverse is some refocusing. There's a realization that people aren't looking to escape reality; they're looking for virtual environments and experiences that enable them to improve this real world we live in.
And this is a perspective that really energizes us as a focused technology company that combines the real and the digital worlds. We see this value proposition applying to market segment after market segment. And now we're embedding this strategy into what we call the #IndustrialMetaverse, which we're now working to advance with partners such as NVIDIA.

"Matthew Prince is the Co-Founder and CEO of Cloudflare. In the episode, we discuss fascinating anecdotes from Cloudflare's (um) eclectic early customers, the founding team's dynamics, and the best lessons he has for entrepreneurs from building Cloudflare to a $20B public company.
On choosing a strong founding team:
Matthew previously started a company with his best friends, and their similarities led to constant fights and problems. He realized the entrepreneurial dream isn't about starting something with your buddies but rather with diverse people who have different skills than you. Matthew emphasizes, ""if you need to talk about how you divide responsibilities among a founding team, it means you have the wrong founding team.""
On making tough decisions:
In the early days of Cloudflare, the team would constantly ask themselves ""if Cloudflare ran the entire Internet, What would the right decision be?"" The question pushed them to make technical decisions that allowed Cloudflare to scale, and it helped with hiring and conflict resolution. The mindset worked, as roughly 20% of the internet's traffic flows through Cloudflare today.
On ignoring revenue
Cloudflare ignored revenue metrics for the four years of the company's life. Instead, the team focused on reducing costs and signing up as many customers as possible. They gathered tons of data from their strange early customers (including a slew of Turkish escorts and other risque websites). Eventually, Cloudflare shifted their focus toward revenue, but only when they started to sign up enterprise customers that would drive the revenue story further.
Overall, an unfiltered conversation about the journey of building Cloudflare into the powerhouse it is today.
