"I'm immensely proud to celebrate our new Pfizer world headquarters in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City. And I'm honored that Mayor Eric Adams joined us for this special occasion.
Pfizer has been headquartered in New York City for nearly 175 years. Our co-founders, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, immigrated from Germany to the U.S. in 1848. They opened the first Pfizer location in Brooklyn the following year, where they began producing the company's first medical breakthrough by blending an antiparasitic called santonin with almond-toffee flavoring to make it more palatable for patients.
Hudson Yards is actually the fourth NYC neighborhood we have called home since then, but our commitment to this amazing city has never wavered. Over the years, Pfizer colleagues have volunteered with many local organizations. One great example is our partnership with the Hudson Guild where, since 2018, our colleagues have logged more than 2,400 volunteer hours at more than 25 Hudson Guild events.
Last summer, Pfizer announced a $1.5 million grant to the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, with funds earmarked for STEM educational programs for middle and high school students. We did this because we are passionate about introducing the city's young students to careers in the life sciences. This vision is also now coming to life at the Pfizer School of Science, an immersive field trip experience for New York City students where they get to interact with""and learn from""Pfizer scientists.
This is only the beginning. Over the next two decades, I firmly believe we'll be living through a scientific renaissance, where the seemingly impossible will become possible in healthcare. I couldn't be more excited for this future, and New York City continues to be the perfect place for us to be as we work to it a reality.",MISC

"To achieve true ""value-based care,"" healthcare organizations need to be able to think about and invest in patient health for longer periods than in 1-year cycles.
There is nothing magical about 365 days. It takes far longer to achieve meaningful (and lasting) improvements in health.
What if health insurance products like Medicare Advantage were sold with 3-year enrollment cycles?
Measurement systems like STAR ratings could be based on true health improvements over 3-year cycles rather than check-box measures presently included in most quality rating systems.
Plans and medical groups could invest in building true and deep relationships with patients rather than gimmicky relationships based on short-term benefit offers.
Our number one obstacle to true value-based care is the annual enrollment cycle.",Health outcomes

"As a person who often travels for work and uses my laptop to close out some work on a flight, here are a few things to think about:
Use a privacy screen filter: A privacy screen filter is a thin, plastic film that you can place over your laptop or mobile device screen. It obscures the view of your screen from anyone who is not directly in front of it, making it difficult for people sitting next to you or behind you to see what you're doing.
Adjust your screen brightness: By turning down the brightness of your screen, you can make it more difficult for others to see what's on your screen. This is especially useful if you're working on sensitive or confidential information.
Use a VPN: When you're traveling and using public Wi-Fi on a plane, your internet connection may not be secure. To keep your data and online activities private, you can use a corporate VPN.

But we've always said that to have a healthy economy, everyone must have the opportunity to participate. That's why for years we've been focused on digital skills training, delivering free training to more than 1 million Brits in more than 500 locations across the UK since 2015.
Today, we're expanding our digital skills training to include AI - and offering new, free AI training to everyone in the UK. Our new AI-focused New Fundamentals training series offers people and businesses practical skills and knowledge to capture the benefits of AI, whether it's to save time, get a new job or grow their business. Google experts have designed 10 easy to follow modules that are packed with practical advice and tips focused on essential AI skills, including two that launch today:
az Grow your Productivity with AI: An introduction, for everyone, to the smartest ways AI tools can save you time. It includes an explanation of what AI is, how it already helps out in everyday products, what Large Language Models are and what they can do, and how to be much more productive with AI - from brainstorming new ideas, to writing code, or reducing the burden of administrative tasks; and
az Understanding Machine Learning: A module designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses leaders, this course teaches the potential of machine learning to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and drive growth. According to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), only 2% of British small and medium-sized businesses are using machine learning tools: so there's huge potential to expand.
Yesterday Google leaders Debbie W. and Ruth Porat, SVP and CFO Google and Alphabet, joined 85 enthusiastic learners - the first to complete the training - at a Google Digital Garage event. And we're excited to release the next eight modules in the coming weeks, covering topics like how to use data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and leadership in a digital world "" skills and expertise needed to run an AI-enabled business.

#Juneteenth celebrates people of African ancestry's independence from slavery, a proclamation given over 150 years ago. The order was delivered some two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Since January 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a State holiday, more than 40 other states passed legislation following. This culminated in the signing into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day. Historians have observed that Juneteenth is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States. It is important to recognize and acknowledge Juneteenth and remember it was the beginning of a long journey towards racial equality in North America.

"I recently had the great pleasure of joining a panel at the Black Corporate Directors Conference to talk about the importance of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world, particularly in the healthcare industry. The Conference serves as a dynamic forum for African-American and Hispanic/Latino directors at Fortune 500 companies to come together and have meaningful discussions about minority representation across all sectors.
At Pfizer, equity is one of our core values, and we constantly strive to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. We do so because it's the right thing to do""the human thing to do. But it's also a smart business strategy, as research shows that DEI has beneficial impacts on business results. For example, the World Economic Forum found that companies that are DEI leaders have up to 20% higher rates of innovation than market average.
Nowhere is equity more important than in the area of healthcare. As the leader of a major healthcare company, I see it as my responsibility to help drive important and lasting changes that close gaps in health equity. That is why my teams are working hard to remove barriers to access and representation in R&D and in clinical trials, and to build trust in minority and undeserved/underrepresented communities.

"#Juneteenth serves as both a celebration of freedom and a reminder of the ongoing work to achieve racial justice.

"Today is Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans. It's a day to recognize the progress we have made against racism""and reaffirm our duty to end it.
Three years ago this month, McKinsey announced 10 actions toward racial equity, our public commitment to anti-racism and social justice. We have made measurable progress in that time.
For example, we have published more than 20 pieces of research on inclusive-growth topics through the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.
Working with more than 20 partner organizations, we have conducted more than 25 pro bono projects supporting Black lives.
More than 67,000 Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Latino professionals have been engaged through our Connected Leaders Academy, which is offered at no cost to attendees.
And we have more than doubled our spend with diverse suppliers""while more than quadrupling our spend with Black-owned businesses since 2019.
I'm proud of these and all the actions we are taking as a firm to advance inclusion. I'm also eager to do much more""and help ensure we continue to accelerate toward a more just and equitable society.

"Since I first started working in the pharma industry, I've witnessed positive change toward creating more equitable opportunities for women in the workforce. And while I remain optimistic for the future, I recognize that we still have a long way to go to change the gender parity for female leaders. We all know unconscious biases still exist in the workplace today. But many focus more on the glass ceiling aspect of female leadership and less on what happens when women rise to the top of leadership ranks. A recent study from Women of Influence+ examined thousands of working women from 100+ countries to determine how their mental health, well-being, engagement and performance were affected by interactions with their colleagues surrounding their success and accomplishments. Almost 90 percent of women worldwide reported being penalized or undermined because of their achievements at work. We must do better. As we celebrate International Women's Day this year, I encourage everyone to support the female leaders in their lives; hold others accountable; and, if you are a leader, deliberately seek out opportunities to create inclusive environments that #EmbraceEquity "" both at work and beyond. At home, I bring up this topic with my son, as fostering an equitable society will take the work of men and women, alike. #IWD2023",DEI

"As we enter Black History month, I thought I would share a story.
Growing up in the 1960s in Louisiana, I was surrounded by ""white"" accomplishments. At least 95% of the faces I saw on TV were white. Most of the people I heard about who were ""important"" were white. The only significant black people I was exposed to were my father who was the third African-American physician in Baton Rouge, LA and some of his fellow black physicians.
Then in 1971 at the age of ten years old something truly important happened in my life when I was in the fifth grade. Our class was assigned to do a project in which each of us had to research and write short biographies of twenty-ish African-American people who were famous through history. I had heard about Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and, of course, I knew Diana Ross and the Supremes and the Temptations and the Jackson Five. I didn't know there were famous black people throughout our country's history, though. They certainly weren't on television or in my school textbooks. So I started my research. There was no internet. No Google or Wikipedia. There was the encyclopedia and the library.
And in a heartbeat my world was expanded. I learned about Crispus Attucks, a black man who was the first American killed in the American Revolution. I learned about the poets Phyllis Wheatley and Paul Laurence Dunbar and the writers Zora Neale Hurston and James Baldwin; black abolitionists who risked their lives during the Civil War like Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth; political leaders like Ralph Bunche and Andrew Young; opera singers Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson and musicians Like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. I learned about Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Mary McCloud Bethune, and Thurgood Marshall; and early leaders of the NAACP like W.E.B. DuBois and Roy Wilkins.
For the first time, I saw myself reflected in the tapestry of this country and its amazing, beautiful, and complicated history. We all need to see ourselves reflected in others who look like us, to show us what is achievable, what is possible. I have been inspired by what those who have come before have accomplished not just on a grand scale like those historic Black Americans who were the subjects of my fifth grade research project, but also on a smaller stage like my father and the other black physicians who grew up in Baton Rouge and wanted to care for their community at a time when there were not any black physicians to take on that responsibility. All of them, their sacrifices, their hardships, their achievements whether large or small made a difference in this world. They left it better than what they started with. I hope that, in turn, I have been able to inspire others, to show them a face that looks like theirs so that they know they can accomplish anything they set their minds to, and they, too, can make a difference, large or small, to make this world a better place. #blackhistorymonth",DEI

First, we were privileged to have Marine Staff Sergeant Eric Alva share his compelling story as Purple Heart honoree and advocate for repeal of the military's Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy. Then we welcomed Air Force General John Pray to share the great work of Operation Homefront, which provides military families with financial assistance. We completed the day making blankets to donate to Fisher House Foundation which supports military families a who have loved ones in the hospital.

One of the questions was: People have told us that a strong DEI program is something potential candidates, especially younger ones, are looking for in a prospective employer. Do you find that to be true?

People are going to be uncomfortable is often used as the reason to avoid having needed conversations. But you need to use your voice as a catalyst for understanding and change, to advocate for others, and to build better communities.
Don't be silent. Use your voice to share your passions.

"As part of a #BlackHistoryMonth panel, I recently had the opportunity to talk about Black Excellence with Norman L. Wright, Michael Hyter and Antonio Henry, MBA. It was an inspiring conversation that left me thankful for the many Black colleagues and leaders I get to interact with both now and throughout my career.
To me, Black Excellence means being a catalyst for change. It's a willingness to be a role model for others and lift up those around you. Many times, it means being the first in your position. And that takes the courage to step outside of your comfort zone.
I am fortunate to be in a role where I can make an impact "" through mentorship of emerging Black leaders and in the work our company is doing to build a more equitable health system, including a pipeline of diverse health care talent.
As Black History Month comes to a close, I hope you take some time to reflect on what Black Excellence means to you not just in the month of February, but year-round.",DEI

"Building genuinely diverse and inclusive workplaces "" and industries "" means creating spaces to progress DEI at every #leadership level.
As part of our commitment to advancing an equitable #healthcare industry, I'm proud to share our first-ever class of Johnson & Johnson Innovation Board Fellows program graduates Y.

"I joined Johnson & Johnson's 2023 Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Achievement (HOLA) Employee Resource Group Summit this week for a focused conversation with our Hispanic and Latino community alongside Joaquin Duato, Wanda Hope and Ashley McEvoy.
 
As CHRO, I believe these sessions are important opportunities to deepen connections with colleagues, share information with allies and help advance our #DEI efforts on a global scale. Important takeaways from our dynamic discussion:
 
Y Fostering a workplace where colleagues can bring their full, authentic selves empowers our people to express their best and most creative ideas.
Y Allyship is about actions and encouraging colleagues to have honest conversations and speak up when needed.
Y Diversity, equity and inclusion isn't the responsibility of one office, department, or individual. We're all responsible and accountable for creating a more #inclusiveworkplace.
Y Only diverse teams can advance our purpose to continue improving #HealthForHumanity, and ERGs, like HOLA, are a direct reflection of the diverse communities we serve.

"In honor of Pride Month, Jill Selby and I reflected on our experience launching the industry's first LGBTQ+ focused Medicare Advantage plan: SCAN Affirm.
""To be clear, we've experienced backlash from both within and outside our organization. A number of members posted derogatory comments on our social media pages. Some of our own employees wrote anti-gay slurs on our internal website. A medical group with whom we'd long partnered""and which had long been treating members who switched to Affirm""declined to specifically serve our Affirm members.
But truth be told, those headwinds are barely a breeze when compared to the gale force of our tailwinds. We've received overwhelming support from employees and health-system partners, and respect and deep gratitude from members - especially, of course, those in the LGBTQ+ community.""

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from ""pure merit.""
Usual arguments for ""pure merit"" include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measure""we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someone's resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to say""whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the land""we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI
