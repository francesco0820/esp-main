"Iâ€™m immensely proud to celebrate our new Pfizer world headquarters in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City. And Iâ€™m honored that Mayor Eric Adams joined us for this special occasion.
Pfizer has been headquartered in New York City for nearly 175 years. Our co-founders, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, immigrated from Germany to the U.S. in 1848. They opened the first Pfizer location in Brooklyn the following year, where they began producing the companyâ€™s first medical breakthrough by blending an antiparasitic called santonin with almond-toffee flavoring to make it more palatable for patients.
Hudson Yards is actually the fourth NYC neighborhood we have called home since then, but our commitment to this amazing city has never wavered. Over the years, Pfizer colleagues have volunteered with many local organizations. One great example is our partnership with the Hudson Guild where, since 2018, our colleagues have logged more than 2,400 volunteer hours at more than 25 Hudson Guild events.
Last summer, Pfizer announced a $1.5 million grant to the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, with funds earmarked for STEM educational programs for middle and high school students. We did this because we are passionate about introducing the cityâ€™s young students to careers in the life sciences. This vision is also now coming to life at the Pfizer School of Science, an immersive field trip experience for New York City students where they get to interact withâ€”and learn fromâ€”Pfizer scientists.
This is only the beginning. Over the next two decades, I firmly believe weâ€™ll be living through a scientific renaissance, where the seemingly impossible will become possible in healthcare. I couldnâ€™t be more excited for this future, and New York City continues to be the perfect place for us to be as we work to it a reality.",MISC

"To achieve true â€œvalue-based care,â€ healthcare organizations need to be able to think about and invest in patient health for longer periods than in 1-year cycles.
There is nothing magical about 365 days. It takes far longer to achieve meaningful (and lasting) improvements in health.
What if health insurance products like Medicare Advantage were sold with 3-year enrollment cycles?
Measurement systems like STAR ratings could be based on true health improvements over 3-year cycles rather than check-box measures presently included in most quality rating systems.
Plans and medical groups could invest in building true and deep relationships with patients rather than gimmicky relationships based on short-term benefit offers.
Our number one obstacle to true value-based care is the annual enrollment cycle.",Health outcomes

"February 11th was #internationaldayofwomenandgirlsinscience â€¦ a meaningful day for my family.
My Grandmother (Maneck-ben): Early 1900â€™s, she became one of the first literate women in her village with the help of a home tutor. Encouraged her daughters.
My Aunt (Guni-masi): Engaged in high school (customary)â€¦ Her Fianceâ€™s grandparents recognized her potential, postponed wedding (breaking tradition) and encouraged/supported her to go to medical school â€¦ Graduated 1st in her class and the only womanâ€¦. Treated many underprivileged people in her career
My mom (Niroo): Excelled math and sciences at a young ageâ€¦ Followed her big sisterâ€¦ Slept in the day and studied at night so she could concentrate in a humble crowded apartmentâ€¦ 1st woman in family to leave India to persue medicine in the USâ€¦ coming alone in early 1970sâ€¦ Dedicated her career to pharma research bringing critical drugs to market.
A small opportunity for education + belief and bravery to break tradition + willpower to peruse a dream
Has equaled === tremendous amounts of opportunities for me, my sister @monisha iyer, and so manyâ€¦
My daughters and nieces now add to this equation in their own way.
Digital inequality is something that I am privately learning about and supportingâ€¦ 1/3 of the world does not have access to internet with women up to 50% less likely to be using the internet than men.
Like my grandmotherâ€™s access to a home tutor, simple access to the internet can start an equation that adds so much to this world.

"The #jobs report from last week painted a picture of both growth and slowing in the labor market. Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates.

"Saturday is Veterans Day in the US. Itâ€™s a day that always meant something in my house. My dad served in Vietnam, and both my granddads served in World War II. They used to talk about how the skills they learned in the service set them up for success later in life. Service members are resilient. They know how to operate under pressure. They have skills in science and technology. They understand what it takes to work as part of a teamâ€”and what it takes to lead. These are highly valuable capabilities, especially in US industries experiencing labor shortages, such as infrastructure and manufacturing.
We just published a new report that puts a number on that value: $15 billion. Thatâ€™s how much could be added to the US economy over a decade by unleashing the value of veteransâ€™ work experience through skills-based hiring. You can read the report here: https://lnkd.in/guCm8duR
We practice this at McKinsey. We hire peopleâ€”not degrees. We have doubled our veteran hires over the last three years, and weâ€™re not done yet. Weâ€™ve also more than tripled our talent recruitment sources, from 540 in 2021 to more than 1,700 this past year, to ensure that everyone with the right skills and talent has a shot at our firm. Building a talent model around skills is good for business and good for society. It boosts the number and quality of applicants who apply to open positions. It gives more people a chance at creating a better life. And it provides a crucial jolt to communities and economies.

"AI holds the potential to completely disrupt every industry, but none more so than medicine. In healthcare, AI will mean more breakthroughs delivered to more people, more quickly.
Yesterday, I attended #DHNY23 for the first time, where we discussed the impact of data and digital technology on drug discovery. I believe that over the next two decades, we will see advances in biology and technology have a dramatic positive impact on human healthâ€”a time where we can hopefully cure many currently incurable conditions, transform others into manageable chronic disease, and be better prepared for future pandemics.
Digital advances are revolutionizing every aspect of healthcare, and my Pfizer colleagues and I are excited to harness these advances to help achieve our goal of significantly improving human health for everyone on the globe.",Data privacy and cybersecurity

"The ongoing housing shortage does more than drive up housing prices and rent, thus squeezing the budget of working families â€“ it may actually be the root cause of a number of societal ills, as reported by Jacob Zinkula for Insider Business. Longer commuting times reduces productivity, and the inability to upgrade means smaller families. And since the best way to build generational wealth is through home ownership, the inability to even purchase that first starter home only exacerbates wealth inequality.
This is an area where the public and private sector, in cooperation with all levels of government, can cooperate to ease the tight housing market and make a basic home more affordable â€“ thus easing a substantial burden on American families, and strengthening our society as a whole. #housingcrisis #wealthinequality

"As a person who often travels for work and uses my laptop to close out some work on a flight, here are a few things to think about:
Use a privacy screen filter: A privacy screen filter is a thin, plastic film that you can place over your laptop or mobile device screen. It obscures the view of your screen from anyone who is not directly in front of it, making it difficult for people sitting next to you or behind you to see what you're doing.
Adjust your screen brightness: By turning down the brightness of your screen, you can make it more difficult for others to see what's on your screen. This is especially useful if you're working on sensitive or confidential information.
Use a VPN: When you're traveling and using public Wi-Fi on a plane, your internet connection may not be secure. To keep your data and online activities private, you can use a corporate VPN.

"AI can have an enormous impact on the UK - with the potential to create over Â£400 billion(!) in economic value for the economy by 2030. But we've always said that to have a healthy economy, everyone must have the opportunity to participate. That's why for years we've been focused on digital skills training, delivering free training to more than 1 million Brits in more than 500 locations across the UK since 2015.
Today, we're expanding our digital skills training to include AI - and offering new, free AI training to everyone in the UK. Our new AI-focused New Fundamentals training series offers people and businesses practical skills and knowledge to capture the benefits of AI, whether it's to save time, get a new job or grow their business. Google experts have designed 10 easy to follow modules that are packed with practical advice and tips focused on essential AI skills, including two that launch today:
âž¡ Grow your Productivity with AI: An introduction, for everyone, to the smartest ways AI tools can save you time. It includes an explanation of what AI is, how it already helps out in everyday products, what Large Language Models are and what they can do, and how to be much more productive with AI - from brainstorming new ideas, to writing code, or reducing the burden of administrative tasks; and
âž¡ Understanding Machine Learning: A module designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses leaders, this course teaches the potential of machine learning to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and drive growth. According to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), only 2% of British small and medium-sized businesses are using machine learning tools: so there's huge potential to expand.
Yesterday Google leaders Debbie W. and Ruth Porat, SVP and CFO Google and Alphabet, joined 85 enthusiastic learners - the first to complete the training - at a Google Digital Garage event. And we're excited to release the next eight modules in the coming weeks, covering topics like how to use data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and leadership in a digital world â€“ skills and expertise needed to run an AI-enabled business.

Under this agreement, by January 2024, our oral treatment will be offered through commercial channels, not just the emergency federal channels created and used by the US government during the pandemic. As a result, more pharmacies, clinics and other healthcare sites are expected to be able to stock this treatment, making it more accessible for eligible patients across the US.
In addition, on behalf of the federal government, Pfizer will set up a patient assistance program for the uninsured and underinsured through 2028. Patients insured through federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive treatment free of charge in 2024.

I respect and am active in the hard work that is underway to shift the narrative of segregation and inequality to one where diverse voices are included at the table and heard across all avenues.
#Juneteenth celebrates people of African ancestryâ€™s independence from slavery, a proclamation given over 150 years ago. The order was delivered some two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Since January 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a State holiday, more than 40 other states passed legislation following. This culminated in the signing into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day. Historians have observed that Juneteenth is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States. It is important to recognize and acknowledge Juneteenth and remember it was the beginning of a long journey towards racial equality in North America.
Throughout the year, lets celebrate the heritage of African American/Canadian people in our country and in our communities, reflect on the many contributions they have made since the 1600s and hear their hope of participating equally in a just society. As we educate ourselves and become better allies, we can make a difference.
