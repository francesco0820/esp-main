"I'm immensely proud to celebrate our new Pfizer world headquarters in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City. And I'm honored that Mayor Eric Adams joined us for this special occasion.
Pfizer has been headquartered in New York City for nearly 175 years. Our co-founders, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, immigrated from Germany to the U.S. in 1848. They opened the first Pfizer location in Brooklyn the following year, where they began producing the company's first medical breakthrough by blending an antiparasitic called santonin with almond-toffee flavoring to make it more palatable for patients.
Hudson Yards is actually the fourth NYC neighborhood we have called home since then, but our commitment to this amazing city has never wavered. Over the years, Pfizer colleagues have volunteered with many local organizations. One great example is our partnership with the Hudson Guild where, since 2018, our colleagues have logged more than 2,400 volunteer hours at more than 25 Hudson Guild events.
Last summer, Pfizer announced a $1.5 million grant to the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, with funds earmarked for STEM educational programs for middle and high school students. We did this because we are passionate about introducing the city's young students to careers in the life sciences. This vision is also now coming to life at the Pfizer School of Science, an immersive field trip experience for New York City students where they get to interact with""and learn from""Pfizer scientists.
This is only the beginning. Over the next two decades, I firmly believe we'll be living through a scientific renaissance, where the seemingly impossible will become possible in healthcare. I couldn't be more excited for this future, and New York City continues to be the perfect place for us to be as we work to it a reality.",MISC

"I was recently featured in a Q&A article with Corp! Magazine.
One of the questions was: People have told us that a strong DEI program is something potential candidates, especially younger ones, are looking for in a prospective employer. Do you find that to be true?
My answer: Yes, today's younger generation is expecting organizations to ""do better"" in the space of DEI. They want to work for a company that has a social conscience and that is progressive and human-centered. And our population is growing increasingly diverse. So, the importance of DEI will continue to increase with time. To view the full list of questions and answers, go to: https://lnkd.in/gPNBSpdM

"The #jobs report from last week painted a picture of both growth and slowing in the labor market. Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates. The path to normalized trading and financing activity in the market hinges on acknowledging realistic valuations and accepting that interest rates won't be decreasing anytime soon.",Economic Outlook

As CHRO, I believe these sessions are important opportunities to deepen connections with colleagues, share information with allies and help advance our #DEI efforts on a global scale. Important takeaways from our dynamic discussion:
 
Y Fostering a workplace where colleagues can bring their full, authentic selves empowers our people to express their best and most creative ideas.
Y Allyship is about actions and encouraging colleagues to have honest conversations and speak up when needed.
Y Diversity, equity and inclusion isn't the responsibility of one office, department, or individual. We're all responsible and accountable for creating a more #inclusiveworkplace.
Y Only diverse teams can advance our purpose to continue improving #HealthForHumanity, and ERGs, like HOLA, are a direct reflection of the diverse communities we serve.

"Saturday is Veterans Day in the US. It's a day that always meant something in my house. My dad served in Vietnam, and both my granddads served in World War II. They used to talk about how the skills they learned in the service set them up for success later in life. Service members are resilient. They know how to operate under pressure. They have skills in science and technology. They understand what it takes to work as part of a team""and what it takes to lead. These are highly valuable capabilities, especially in US industries experiencing labor shortages, such as infrastructure and manufacturing.
We just published a new report that puts a number on that value: $15 billion. That's how much could be added to the US economy over a decade by unleashing the value of veterans' work experience through skills-based hiring. You can read the report here: https://lnkd.in/guCm8duR
We practice this at McKinsey. We hire people""not degrees. We have doubled our veteran hires over the last three years, and we're not done yet. We've also more than tripled our talent recruitment sources, from 540 in 2021 to more than 1,700 this past year, to ensure that everyone with the right skills and talent has a shot at our firm. Building a talent model around skills is good for business and good for society. It boosts the number and quality of applicants who apply to open positions. It gives more people a chance at creating a better life. And it provides a crucial jolt to communities and economies.
