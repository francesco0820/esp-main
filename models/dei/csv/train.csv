"For #WomensHistoryMonth month, I want to share an amazing conversation with some inspiring colleagues.
In 2021, Pfizer launched the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiative, a program that supports the economic inclusion of refugees and other displaced people through hiring, mentoring and advocating. Our initial goal was to hire 100 refugees and to mentor 150 by the end of 2022""and we surpassed that goal in just one year. We have now extended our goal and committed to hiring 500 refugees by the end of 2025.
Through this program, we welcomed our colleagues Baheshta Abed Rahimi, and Najlla Habibyar. In the latest episode of our series, ""Something's Brewing: Coffee and Conversation,"" my colleague Mona Babury, CDP, PMP""a pillar of the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiative""spoke with Najilla and Bahesta about their unique journeys, the challenges they have faced, and how they're building their futures at Pfizer.
I encourage you to check out this wonderful dialogue that celebrates women's stories.

My Grandmother (Maneck-ben): Early 1900's, she became one of the first literate women in her village with the help of a home tutor. Encouraged her daughters.

"Today, I reflect on our commitment, as colleagues and citizens in our communities, to driving change for equity and inclusion. I respect and am active in the hard work that is underway to shift the narrative of segregation and inequality to one where diverse voices are included at the table and heard across all avenues.
#Juneteenth celebrates people of African ancestry's independence from slavery, a proclamation given over 150 years ago. The order was delivered some two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Since January 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a State holiday, more than 40 other states passed legislation following. This culminated in the signing into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day. Historians have observed that Juneteenth is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States. It is important to recognize and acknowledge Juneteenth and remember it was the beginning of a long journey towards racial equality in North America.
Throughout the year, lets celebrate the heritage of African American/Canadian people in our country and in our communities, reflect on the many contributions they have made since the 1600s and hear their hope of participating equally in a just society. As we educate ourselves and become better allies, we can make a difference.

"Since I first started working in the pharma industry, I've witnessed positive change toward creating more equitable opportunities for women in the workforce. And while I remain optimistic for the future, I recognize that we still have a long way to go to change the gender parity for female leaders. We all know unconscious biases still exist in the workplace today. But many focus more on the glass ceiling aspect of female leadership and less on what happens when women rise to the top of leadership ranks. A recent study from Women of Influence+ examined thousands of working women from 100+ countries to determine how their mental health, well-being, engagement and performance were affected by interactions with their colleagues surrounding their success and accomplishments. Almost 90 percent of women worldwide reported being penalized or undermined because of their achievements at work. We must do better.

Use a privacy screen filter: A privacy screen filter is a thin, plastic film that you can place over your laptop or mobile device screen. It obscures the view of your screen from anyone who is not directly in front of it, making it difficult for people sitting next to you or behind you to see what you're doing.
Adjust your screen brightness: By turning down the brightness of your screen, you can make it more difficult for others to see what's on your screen. This is especially useful if you're working on sensitive or confidential information.

Usual arguments for ""pure merit"" include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measure""we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someone's resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to say""whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the land""we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI

Reflecting on the many contributions women make in healthcare, as practitioners and leaders, I recognize that there is more work to be done in access to healthcare and health outcomes for women. As leaders, we have a critical role to play in advocating for practices and policies that promote equitable access to healthcare for all women. But advancing gender equity isn't just about policies and practices, it is also about building an inclusive work environment, where women can thrive and contribute their unique perspectives and expertise.

"To achieve true ""value-based care,"" healthcare organizations need to be able to think about and invest in patient health for longer periods than in 1-year cycles.
There is nothing magical about 365 days. It takes far longer to achieve meaningful (and lasting) improvements in health.
What if health insurance products like Medicare Advantage were sold with 3-year enrollment cycles?
Measurement systems like STAR ratings could be based on true health improvements over 3-year cycles rather than check-box measures presently included in most quality rating systems.
Plans and medical groups could invest in building true and deep relationships with patients rather than gimmicky relationships based on short-term benefit offers.
Our number one obstacle to true value-based care is the annual enrollment cycle.",Health outcomes
"As I prepare for the 2023 APEC CEO Summit, what's top of mind for me is the danger exclusion poses to our society and our world. In fact, there may be nothing more urgent than the need to create a world that is rich with inclusion. I believe that many of our most urgent problems stem from the absence of inclusion""the heartbreaking sense of isolation or otherness""and the solutions to these problems will depend on fostering inclusion for those who have been robbed of it. Rarely have we seen a world with so many challenges at one time as we do now, yet for all their particulars and complexities, these challenges all have exclusion at their root.
Leaders of the business community all have the means""and obligation""to address these challenges. At this year's hashtag#APECCEOSummitUSA, I hope to impress upon my peers in the room the importance of this work.

At Pfizer, equity is one of our core values, and we constantly strive to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. We do so because it's the right thing to do""the human thing to do. But it's also a smart business strategy, as research shows that DEI has beneficial impacts on business results.

Nowhere is equity more important than in the area of healthcare. As the leader of a major healthcare company, I see it as my responsibility to help drive important and lasting changes that close gaps in health equity. That is why my teams are working hard to remove barriers to access and representation in R&D and in clinical trials, and to build trust in minority and undeserved/underrepresented communities.

"As we enter Black History month, I thought I would share a story.
Growing up in the 1960s in Louisiana, I was surrounded by ""white"" accomplishments. At least 95% of the faces I saw on TV were white. Most of the people I heard about who were ""important"" were white. The only significant black people I was exposed to were my father who was the third African-American physician in Baton Rouge, LA and some of his fellow black physicians.
Then in 1971 at the age of ten years old something truly important happened in my life when I was in the fifth grade. Our class was assigned to do a project in which each of us had to research and write short biographies of twenty-ish African-American people who were famous through history. I had heard about Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and, of course, I knew Diana Ross and the Supremes and the Temptations and the Jackson Five. I didn't know there were famous black people throughout our country's history, though. They certainly weren't on television or in my school textbooks. So I started my research. There was no internet. No Google or Wikipedia. There was the encyclopedia and the library.
And in a heartbeat my world was expanded. I learned about Crispus Attucks, a black man who was the first American killed in the American Revolution. I learned about the poets Phyllis Wheatley and Paul Laurence Dunbar and the writers Zora Neale Hurston and James Baldwin; black abolitionists who risked their lives during the Civil War like Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth; political leaders like Ralph Bunche and Andrew Young; opera singers Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson and musicians Like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. I learned about Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Mary McCloud Bethune, and Thurgood Marshall; and early leaders of the NAACP like W.E.B. DuBois and Roy Wilkins.
For the first time, I saw myself reflected in the tapestry of this country and its amazing, beautiful, and complicated history. We all need to see ourselves reflected in others who look like us, to show us what is achievable, what is possible. I have been inspired by what those who have come before have accomplished not just on a grand scale like those historic Black Americans who were the subjects of my fifth grade research project, but also on a smaller stage like my father and the other black physicians who grew up in Baton Rouge and wanted to care for their community at a time when there were not any black physicians to take on that responsibility. All of them, their sacrifices, their hardships, their achievements whether large or small made a difference in this world. They left it better than what they started with. I hope that, in turn, I have been able to inspire others, to show them a face that looks like theirs so that they know they can accomplish anything they set their minds to, and they, too, can make a difference, large or small, to make this world a better place. #blackhistorymonth",DEI

"Today, Pfizer signed an important agreement with the US federal government that will make it easier for eligible patients to access our oral hashtag#COVID19 treatment, helps enable the U.S. to have a robust stockpile of this treatment for future use, and helps provide additional clarity on the commercial market for our hashtag#COVID19-related products, reducing future uncertainty.
Under this agreement, by January 2024, our oral treatment will be offered through commercial channels, not just the emergency federal channels created and used by the US government during the pandemic. As a result, more pharmacies, clinics and other healthcare sites are expected to be able to stock this treatment, making it more accessible for eligible patients across the US.
In addition, on behalf of the federal government, Pfizer will set up a patient assistance program for the uninsured and underinsured through 2028. Patients insured through federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive treatment free of charge in 2024.
