"I was deeply honored today to speak on a panel on â€œThe Essential Role of Women Leaders in Global Healthâ€ at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for #RadDay23, where Ophelia Dahl was awarded the 2023 Radcliffe Medal. I was so moved by the testimonial from Chelsea Clinton about the leadership, moral purpose, and humanity that Ophelia has brought to her work, and both inspired and humbled to speak about Oxfamâ€™s work on health, humanitarian response, and promoting feminist leadership alongside Jacqueline Bhabha, Agnes Binagwaho, Natalia Kanem, and Reema Nanavaty - amazing women who choose to use their time and considerable talents to improve the health and wellbeing of families around the world.

"As we celebrate #IWD2023 International Women's Day, Iâ€™m proud to recognize the many achievements of women around the world. Throughout my career, I had the privilege to work with incredibly talented and accomplished women in Finance and Informatics, and in business overall.
Reflecting on the many contributions women make in healthcare, as practitioners and leaders, I recognize that there is more work to be done in access to healthcare and health outcomes for women. As leaders, we have a critical role to play in advocating for practices and policies that promote equitable access to healthcare for all women. But advancing gender equity isnâ€™t just about policies and practices, it is also about building an inclusive work environment, where women can thrive and contribute their unique perspectives and expertise.
Let's commit ourselves to promote diversity today and every day and to #EmbraceEquity!

"Yesterday, I had the pleasure to meet with more than 40 remarkable female leaders in Finance and Informatics. We had a deep conversation about the current business topics, career decisions as well as personal experiences.
All participants are part of our Global Female Leadership Program which is one of our key company-wide initiatives to build a strong pipeline of emerging leaders and make sure we grow and retain the best talents.
It was a privilege to be part of this exchange and I left our meeting inspired and energised since it reminded me of the incredible power of diverse teams. Keep thriving!

"Yesterday, I had the privilege of speaking at the 2023 APEC CEO Summit about the importance of curing the exclusion epidemic. Our world is ailing right now. And just as with a patient, those of us who want to heal this world need to look for the deeper conditions that are underneath our surface-level problems. What I see when I look for the root cause of many of todayâ€™s challenges is exclusion â€“ economic exclusion, social exclusion, political exclusion and personal exclusion. During my remarks, I shared my thoughts on each and on the responsibility that leaders of the business community have not only to build more inclusive cultures within our individual companies, but also to help build a more inclusive society in the places where we operate. Being the optimist that I am, I believe we can cure the ills brought on by this epidemic, and I invite you to read or view my speech to learn why.",DEI
"As I prepare for the 2023 APEC CEO Summit, whatâ€™s top of mind for me is the danger exclusion poses to our society and our world. In fact, there may be nothing more urgent than the need to create a world that is rich with inclusion. I believe that many of our most urgent problems stem from the absence of inclusionâ€”the heartbreaking sense of isolation or othernessâ€”and the solutions to these problems will depend on fostering inclusion for those who have been robbed of it. Rarely have we seen a world with so many challenges at one time as we do now, yet for all their particulars and complexities, these challenges all have exclusion at their root.
Leaders of the business community all have the meansâ€”and obligationâ€”to address these challenges. At this yearâ€™s hashtag#APECCEOSummitUSA, I hope to impress upon my peers in the room the importance of this work. Whether it is through partnerships, policies or practices that promote inclusion, we have a responsibility to build inclusive ecosystems that are not only good for the business world, but more importantly good for society. This Wednesday, I look forward to sharing more of my thoughts, and the potential solutions to the Exclusion Epidemic.",DEI
"For #WomensHistoryMonth month, I want to share an amazing conversation with some inspiring colleagues.
In 2021, Pfizer launched the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiative, a program that supports the economic inclusion of refugees and other displaced people through hiring, mentoring and advocating. Our initial goal was to hire 100 refugees and to mentor 150 by the end of 2022â€”and we surpassed that goal in just one year. We have now extended our goal and committed to hiring 500 refugees by the end of 2025.
Through this program, we welcomed our colleagues Baheshta Abed Rahimi, and Najlla Habibyar. In the latest episode of our series, â€œSomething's Brewing: Coffee and Conversation,â€ my colleague Mona Babury, CDP, PMPâ€”a pillar of the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiativeâ€”spoke with Najilla and Bahesta about their unique journeys, the challenges they have faced, and how theyâ€™re building their futures at Pfizer.
I encourage you to check out this wonderful dialogue that celebrates womenâ€™s stories.

"We hear many stories of courage here at Pfizer. Recently, I was inspired by the essays in our 2023 Pride Journal, where our LGBTQ+ colleagues shared their personal experiences of struggles, triumphs, and hopes for the future in honor of Pride Month. The theme of this yearâ€™s Journal is â€œStronger Togetherâ€â€”and I canâ€™t think of a more fitting theme to celebrate Pfizerâ€™s culture of #courage and #equity, and to reaffirm our commitment that Pfizer continues to be a place where all colleagues can be their best and truest selves.
Thank you to my colleagues who shared their stories in this yearâ€™s Journal. Below are a few, and you can read all of them here: https://lnkd.in/eST5_nMh

"Incredibly #PfizerProud that Pfizer was ranked #6 in TIMEâ€™s inaugural list of the Worldâ€™s Best Companies 2023. The list includes some of the most innovative, creative and impactful organizations from around the globeâ€”companies that are â€œchanging the worldâ€ as the article saysâ€”so it is humbling to see Pfizerâ€™s name among them.
Congratulations to all of my colleagues at Pfizer for this well-deserved recognition! I couldn't be prouder to work with people who are dedicated to transforming the lives of patients around the world. From developing life-saving vaccines and medicines, to tackling global health challenges, and so much moreâ€”thank you to my Pfizer colleagues for your tireless dedication to our patients.",DEI
"I have had the honor and privilege of working with many talented women. Iâ€™m indebted to them for their contributions to Pfizer and for teaching me some of the most important lessons of my career. Today, on International Womenâ€™s Day, I want to say: Thank you for being my mentors, colleagues & friends. #IWD",DEI
"Really enjoyed reading this article from my colleague William Pao. With Clinical Trials Day around the corner, William shares his thoughts on how prioritizing diversity in clinical trials can help facilitate health equity for people everywhere. As he notes, â€œRace, ethnicity, age, and gender can all impact how different people respond to the same medicine or vaccine.â€ Iâ€™m proud of how diligently his team is working to ensure that our Pfizer clinical studies reflect the diversity of the potential patient populations for each drug and vaccine candidate. Itâ€™s one of the ways weâ€™re working to advance health equity. #CTD2023 #ClinicalTrialsDay",DEI
"On #WorldRefugeeDay, I'm proud to co-sign this statement with Pfizer's partner, the International Rescue Committee, alongside other business leaders to call on the private sector to help create new, long-term solutions to address the growing refugee crisis. With more than 100 million people displaced globally, advocating for the private sector's role in tackling the global refugee crisis is more important than ever. In line with Pfizerâ€™s core value of #equity, we are committed to doing our part to support the economic inclusion of refugees and other displaced people through hiring, mentoring and advocating. In September 2021, we launched the Refugee Leadership Initiative with a commitment to hire 100 refugees and mentor an additional 150 refugees by the end of 2022. We achieved both goals ahead of schedule, and now our expanded pledge includes hiring 500 refugees in the U.S. and an additional 100 refugees in Europe, and mentoring 300 refugees, by the end of 2025.",DEI
"I recently had the great pleasure of joining a panel at the Black Corporate Directors Conference to talk about the importance of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world, particularly in the healthcare industry. The Conference serves as a dynamic forum for African-American and Hispanic/Latino directors at Fortune 500 companies to come together and have meaningful discussions about minority representation across all sectors.
At Pfizer, equity is one of our core values, and we constantly strive to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. We do so because itâ€™s the right thing to doâ€”the human thing to do. But itâ€™s also a smart business strategy, as research shows that DEI has beneficial impacts on business results. For example, the World Economic Forum found that companies that are DEI leaders have up to 20% higher rates of innovation than market average.
Nowhere is equity more important than in the area of healthcare. As the leader of a major healthcare company, I see it as my responsibility to help drive important and lasting changes that close gaps in health equity. That is why my teams are working hard to remove barriers to access and representation in R&D and in clinical trials, and to build trust in minority and undeserved/underrepresented communities.
Equity doesnâ€™t mean giving everyone the same thing. It means working to level the playing field for everyoneâ€”from corporate offices to doctorsâ€™ offices, and everywhere in between. Together we can create a better future for patients from all backgrounds.",DEI

"I had the opportunity earlier this week to listen to our DEI panel at the AspenTech Sales meeting in Boston. DEI is a core value at AspenTech, which means it is embedded in all interactions - with colleagues and customers. And as I listened to the panel with diverse representation from all our DEI chapters around the world, I couldnâ€™t be more proud of our team and the passion they conveyed around the importance of DEI in their Sales roles. As Rosa Montesinos, one of our panelists and Director of Solution Consulting in LATAM, stated, â€œDEI is about understanding peoplesâ€™ cultures and being respectful with empathy. Itâ€™s not only accepting people as they are but also creating an environment for people to express themselves with freedom and confidence.â€
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I pause to recognize the gratitude I have for our team at AspenTech and how proud I am for how far we have come in building an environment that demands equality, promotes inclusion and celebrates diversity.

"Today is Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans. Itâ€™s a day to recognize the progress we have made against racismâ€”and reaffirm our duty to end it.
Three years ago this month, McKinsey announced 10 actions toward racial equity, our public commitment to anti-racism and social justice. We have made measurable progress in that time.
For example, we have published more than 20 pieces of research on inclusive-growth topics through the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.
Working with more than 20 partner organizations, we have conducted more than 25 pro bono projects supporting Black lives.
More than 67,000 Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Latino professionals have been engaged through our Connected Leaders Academy, which is offered at no cost to attendees.
And we have more than doubled our spend with diverse suppliersâ€”while more than quadrupling our spend with Black-owned businesses since 2019.
Iâ€™m proud of these and all the actions we are taking as a firm to advance inclusion. Iâ€™m also eager to do much moreâ€”and help ensure we continue to accelerate toward a more just and equitable society.

"Since I first started working in the pharma industry, Iâ€™ve witnessed positive change toward creating more equitable opportunities for women in the workforce. And while I remain optimistic for the future, I recognize that we still have a long way to go to change the gender parity for female leaders. We all know unconscious biases still exist in the workplace today. But many focus more on the glass ceiling aspect of female leadership and less on what happens when women rise to the top of leadership ranks. A recent study from Women of Influence+ examined thousands of working women from 100+ countries to determine how their mental health, well-being, engagement and performance were affected by interactions with their colleagues surrounding their success and accomplishments. Almost 90 percent of women worldwide reported being penalized or undermined because of their achievements at work. We must do better. As we celebrate International Womenâ€™s Day this year, I encourage everyone to support the female leaders in their lives; hold others accountable; and, if you are a leader, deliberately seek out opportunities to create inclusive environments that #EmbraceEquity â€“ both at work and beyond. At home, I bring up this topic with my son, as fostering an equitable society will take the work of men and women, alike. #IWD2023",DEI

"As we enter Black History month, I thought I would share a story.
Growing up in the 1960s in Louisiana, I was surrounded by â€œwhiteâ€ accomplishments. At least 95% of the faces I saw on TV were white. Most of the people I heard about who were â€œimportantâ€ were white. The only significant black people I was exposed to were my father who was the third African-American physician in Baton Rouge, LA and some of his fellow black physicians.
Then in 1971 at the age of ten years old something truly important happened in my life when I was in the fifth grade. Our class was assigned to do a project in which each of us had to research and write short biographies of twenty-ish African-American people who were famous through history. I had heard about Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and, of course, I knew Diana Ross and the Supremes and the Temptations and the Jackson Five. I didnâ€™t know there were famous black people throughout our countryâ€™s history, though. They certainly werenâ€™t on television or in my school textbooks. So I started my research. There was no internet. No Google or Wikipedia. There was the encyclopedia and the library.
And in a heartbeat my world was expanded. I learned about Crispus Attucks, a black man who was the first American killed in the American Revolution. I learned about the poets Phyllis Wheatley and Paul Laurence Dunbar and the writers Zora Neale Hurston and James Baldwin; black abolitionists who risked their lives during the Civil War like Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth; political leaders like Ralph Bunche and Andrew Young; opera singers Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson and musicians Like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. I learned about Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Mary McCloud Bethune, and Thurgood Marshall; and early leaders of the NAACP like W.E.B. DuBois and Roy Wilkins.
For the first time, I saw myself reflected in the tapestry of this country and its amazing, beautiful, and complicated history. We all need to see ourselves reflected in others who look like us, to show us what is achievable, what is possible. I have been inspired by what those who have come before have accomplished not just on a grand scale like those historic Black Americans who were the subjects of my fifth grade research project, but also on a smaller stage like my father and the other black physicians who grew up in Baton Rouge and wanted to care for their community at a time when there were not any black physicians to take on that responsibility. All of them, their sacrifices, their hardships, their achievements whether large or small made a difference in this world. They left it better than what they started with. I hope that, in turn, I have been able to inspire others, to show them a face that looks like theirs so that they know they can accomplish anything they set their minds to, and they, too, can make a difference, large or small, to make this world a better place. #blackhistorymonth",DEI

"On Thursday, the General Mills Veterans Network recognized Veteran's Day. The nobility of duty that compels citizens to serve in an all volunteer military force. It's a profession where the benefits of service members' commitment are universal but the sacrifices they and their families make are privatized. We were honored with not one but two distinguished veterans of the US military who have done great service on behalf of active and retired service members. First, we were privileged to have Marine Staff Sergeant Eric Alva share his compelling story as Purple Heart honoree and advocate for repeal of the military's Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy. Then we welcomed Air Force General John Pray to share the great work of Operation Homefront, which provides military families with financial assistance. We completed the day making blankets to donate to Fisher House Foundation which supports military families a who have loved ones in the hospital. There are so many ways to recognize the sacrifice and commitment of our veterans. I'd encourage you to recognize our veterans on Veteran's Day, starting with a thank you, acts of service on their behalf, or donations to the organization of your choice that supports veterans and their families. hashtag#veteransday",DEI

ðŸ“ We aspire to be the partner of choice for organizations making a difference in DEI in our communities, and we back that goal with a pro bono commitment of $100M to social justice and racial and gender equity.
ðŸ“ Representation of women in leadership grew again in all three regions, reaching nearly 40% in the Americas and increasing 4 points in EMEA.
ðŸ“ Within the US, weâ€™ve achieved increases in representation for all underrepresented groupsâ€”overall and at the leadership level.
We continue to make concrete progress against our global DEI ambition, while relentlessly asking ourselves how we can do better. Our goal â€“ to ensure every Bainie feels fully included and supported â€“ is ambitious, but weâ€™re committed to taking bold action to get there. #atBain #ThenNowNext

"I was recently featured in a Q&A article with Corp! Magazine.
One of the questions was: People have told us that a strong DEI program is something potential candidates, especially younger ones, are looking for in a prospective employer. Do you find that to be true?
My answer: Yes, today's younger generation is expecting organizations to ""do better"" in the space of DEI. They want to work for a company that has a social conscience and that is progressive and human-centered. And our population is growing increasingly diverse. So, the importance of DEI will continue to increase with time. To view the full list of questions and answers, go to: https://lnkd.in/gPNBSpdM

â€œTo be clear, weâ€™ve experienced backlash from both within and outside our organization. A number of members posted derogatory comments on our social media pages. Some of our own employees wrote anti-gay slurs on our internal website. A medical group with whom weâ€™d long partneredâ€”and which had long been treating members who switched to Affirmâ€”declined to specifically serve our Affirm members.
But truth be told, those headwinds are barely a breeze when compared to the gale force of our tailwinds. Weâ€™ve received overwhelming support from employees and health-system partners, and respect and deep gratitude from members - especially, of course, those in the LGBTQ+ community.â€

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from â€œpure merit.â€
Usual arguments for â€œpure meritâ€ include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measureâ€”we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someoneâ€™s resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to sayâ€”whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the landâ€”we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI
