"🚇🗽I've been amazed by how few people visiting NYC know about the single greatest user experience improvement available to them when riding the NYC Subway System. I love UX solutions executed flawlessly across multiple systems unrelated to one another. 

For this experience to work the following all have to cooperate:
✅ Government run turnstiles 
✅ Private hardware technology companies 
✅ Private banks 

And the benefit to the end user includes 
✅ no line times for ticket machines
✅ reduced cost by eliminating expired tickets
✅ increased turnstile velocity with an easier payment mechanism 

These are the types of end to end experiences we should be working towards collectively.

In conversations with companies and recruiters regarding company team structures, I am alarmed at how many companies donâ€™t see the risk involved.

"News: edge computing startup Armada is looking to bring AI to remote places like oil rigs and mines. Led by CEO Dan Wright, one-year-old Armada has a ""close collaboration"" with SpaceX and is already valued at close to $250 million, raising $55 million.Cofounded with Jonathan Runyan, Armada was backed pretty much out of the gate by a who's who of defense and industrial minded VCs like Trae Stephens at Founders Fund, Shahin Farshchi at Lux Capital and Shield Capital. It's still in trials with customers, meaning no meaningful revenue yet.Its flagship hardware product is the Galleon, a 40 ft. container of military-grade heavy gauge steel that can fit on a trailer and house 6 racks of GPUs for running AI models in remote environments like oil rigs, mines, and advanced combat ops bases. But it also offers its own app store of AI applications running at the edge, as well as software for managing the use of Space Starlink terminals.Armada also represents something of a comeback for CEO Wright, the former AppDynamics COO who resigned as CEO of AI software unicorn DataRobot last summer amid reported controversy around insider stock sales.And it represents an interesting, and possibly the first, effort by a startup to build on top of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, making them more commercially useful for media companies and others looking to stream video or run AI apps in remote locations.hashtag#edgecomputing hashtag#AI hashtag#edge hashtag#cloud hashtag#cloudcomputing hashtag#spacex hashtag#starlink hashtag#armada hashtag#armadagalleon hashtag#artificialintelligence hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Industry hashtag#defense hashtag#venturecapital hashtag#VC hashtag#startups hashtag#tech hashtag#technology","User Experience,AI/Machine Learning",checked

"ðŸš€ Exciting News in AI: Apple Aims to Bring AI to iPhones ðŸ“±Apple is making a bold move in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) by focusing on running AI directly on its hardware instead of relying on the cloud. In a recent research paper titled ""LLM in a Flash,"" Apple's researchers propose a solution to the current computational bottleneck of running large language models (LLMs) on devices with limited memory. This signifies Apple's intention to catch up with its Silicon Valley competitors in generative AI, a technology that powers applications like ChatGPT.Here are the key takeaways from Apple's research:ðŸ”¹ Apple's research offers a solution to running LLMs on devices with limited memory, paving the way for effective inference on iPhones.ðŸ”¹ Apple's focus on AI running directly on iPhones is a departure from its competitors, such as Microsoft and Google, who prioritize delivering AI services from their cloud platforms.ðŸ”¹ This move by Apple aligns with the trend of AI-focused smartphones entering the market, with estimations of over 100 million AI-focused smartphones shipping by 2024.ðŸ”¹ Bringing AI to smartphones has the potential to revolutionize the user experience, allowing for new innovations and anticipating users' actions.ðŸ”¹ Running AI models on personal devices presents technical challenges, but it could result in faster response times, offline capabilities, and enhanced privacy.Apple's research paper offers a glimpse into the company's cutting-edge research and sets a precedent for future AI development. Optimizing LLMs for battery-powered devices is a growing focus for AI researchers, and Apple's approach opens doors for harnessing the full potential of AI in various devices and applications.As the AI landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for technology companies to ensure that the benefits of AI reach the widest audience possible.

"Whatâ€™s next for phygitals: (market & key trends for 2024)Products turn into acquisition channels. Here's how: In 2023, major brands started connecting physical goods to virtual counterparts to create phygital experiences.Zoom in:â€¢ Often, this means that owning a physical products unlocks a corresponding digital ID or collectible, or vice-versa. â€¢ Users connect their â€œwalletâ€ to the physical product connected to a visual or electronic tag (RFID or NFC).Understanding the market:We have three types of technology providers enabling this:1.Â Infrastructure providers like EON , Arianee, KORE Technologies Switzerland who are focused on equipping big brands with the tech needed for the Digital Product Passport.2.Â Marketing-focused like â€¢ Swiss-based ZATAP by collectID (shown in picture) and VIVENTS, â€¢ or New York-based Solaire and IYK* (funded by a16z crypto ), who focuses on creating an end-to-end solution for brands to create marketing campaigns with â€œtokenizedâ€ products.3. Translators who turn physical into digital, such as â€¢ NAK3D, bringing physical product to virtual worlds or â€¢ SOL3MATES , who partners with leading brands to facilitate exclusive phygital drops. Sol3mates is part of @Chalhoub Group, one of the leading luxury retailers in the middle east.Context: Most often, this happens collaboratively and includes players like Crossmint or Aura Blockchain Consortium. Whatâ€™s next?ðŸ”®Phygitals enable brands to create:â€“Â blockchain-secured limited editions,â€“Â authenticate products,â€“Â engage in post-purchase marketing,â€“Â establish direct customer relationships,â€“Â and gather more first-party data.And I think in 2023 we were just scratching the surface.For 2024, I see two big trends:1. Richer, more engaging, gamified phygital experiences, driven by a new wave of Web3 ready, digitally native consumers.Phygitals will turn from top-of-the-funnel collectibles to powerful experiences within a brandâ€™s ecosystem â€“Â and into acquisition channels for brands. 2. Trust-minimized, tokenized commerce: This will unlock buying and selling of phygitals without relying on intermediaries â€“Â DeFi style, with complete freedom to transact.The problem?For phygitals, trustless transactions are still an unsolved issue, i.e. tokenizing both goods and the commitment to trade the phyiscal item as NFTs.A company that solves this is Boson Protocol (partner of Dematerialzd.xyz). It enables the exchange of real world assets without centralized intermediaries or hardware on the product.So what? ðŸ’¡Once a product has a unique ID and is on-chain, itâ€™s traceable, intelligent, and more valuable.Just imagine: A brand selling phygitals through a retailer could use the product to win back the customer relationship.The potential is limitless.What's next for consumer Web3?I'll soon drop a deep dive.Subscribe to get it: https://lnkd.in/e5W8x8QxFollow me for Web3 insights",User Experience,checked

"2023 felt like a bit of a sea change for a creative leadership class that had moved into top design roles at many companies. What started as a trickle of outreach last Fall turned into a steady drumbeat of former colleagues reaching out to re-connect and reflect on their purpose, mission and the uncertain value of their hard-won experience in the current economic climate. I recognize that this is a community with extremely diverse backgrounds, experience and professional journeys. But, something collective is definitely happening that seems to transcend the basic reality of the latest economic cycle. What is the continuing role for specialized design leadership in business? Like many of you, I have been taking stock on the current state and what the path ahead looks like for many peers and friends, particularly in the coming age of AI. I have also been delighted to see a wave of new efforts to bring this community together and harness their creativity. So I used some time over the holiday break to step back, reflect and follow this story. The result is a two-part series over at Fast Company. The first part, which launched today, is my attempt to offer some observations on the current state of play and how we got here:https://lnkd.in/e3HTckksThe second part, which will go live in another week or two, looks at the proliferation of new platforms, networks and resources that are emerging to support this creative leadership diaspora, including: Neol, Design Leaders Community, Design Executive Council, Chief Design Officer School and others.I am extremely grateful to so many talented leaders and friends who have shared their wisdom, worries and whose journeys informed and inspired my thinking about the future of this incredibly talented community, including: Doug Powell, Lindsey Mosby, Greg Petroff, Scott Nazarian, John Rousseau, Denise Gershbein, Katrina Alcorn, Rachel K., Rob Magowan, Tim Brown, Kwame Nyanning, Liz Danzico, John Maeda, Thomas Mueller, Maria Giudice, Justin M., Ben Sheppard, UX Collective, Peter Merholz, Rosenfeld Media, Ryan Rumsey, I do not know if this story has been captured anywhere else, so it is my hope that this will increase the space for reflection.hashtag#designleadership hashtag#designleaders hashtag#uxleadership hashtag#designvalue","User Experience,Organizational Change Management",checked

"6 months ago, I shared my new role as the President and Co-Founder of Vale Health. Today, a lot of work from countless people allowed us to announce the first health system going live with their wellness marketplace. https://lnkd.in/gNEVh7yE 

As you will see, we started with better sleep as a health goal. We believe we are the first to really combine evidence-based wellness products, apps, and education with direct links to the clinical services of high quality health care providers into one experience. Now, people can have a trusted wellness marketplace linked to their trusted provider for their total health and wellness needs. 

Many more person-centered goals and categories are coming soon. You will also see the launch of the other founding health systems this year. 

These are still early days, and we know there is a lot to learn still, but I do want to pause today and thank the many people and organizations that came together to get us to the first milestone.

"Users prefer to learn by doing. Not by reading instructions. Every extra word is an opportunity for users to abandon the product. They have more important stuff to do.This is where intuitive design come into play.Let's break it down: 1. Intuitive Navigation: Design your interface in a way that feels natural to the user. Familiar patterns, like swipe to refresh or pinch to zoom, are more effective than instructions. 2. Visual Cues: Use icons, colors, and visual hierarchy to guide users. A well-placed arrow or a different button color can direct users more efficiently than text. Make sure that the design is also aesthetically pleasing. 3. Progressive Disclosure: Only show users what they need when they need it. Overloading them with information upfront is overwhelming. Gradually guide them through complex features. 4. Feedback Systems: Implement immediate feedback for user actions. If they press a button, make something happen. It's a non-verbal way of saying, ""Yes, you're doing it right."" 5. Testing and Iteration: Test your design with real users. What seems intuitive to you might not be for others. Iterate based on feedback to ensure your product truly minimizes the need for instructions. 6. In a world where attention spans are short, the best way to engage users is to let them dive right in. Design for action, not for reading ðŸ‘ hashtag#UX hashtag#productdesign hashtag#productmanagement","User Experience,Human-centered design",checked

"Up here, looking down from the peak of Aiguille Rouge at 3226 meters, it's hard not to be inspired. The mix of snow, sun, and clouds paints a picture of what balance looks like. It makes me think about how we can apply lessons from this stunning environment to the world of customer experience (CX), artificial intelligence (AI), and sustainability.I see AI as a powerful tool, like the sun lighting up these mountains, that can help us understand and cater to our customers better. We can use AI to predict what our customers need before they even know they need it. Like the way these clouds move and change, AI can help us be more adaptable and personalized in our approach.But, with great power comes great responsibility. Every innovation we make with AI needs to be weighed against its impact on our planet. Just as we marvel at the beauty of untouched snow, we need to protect the natural beauty of our world. We must strive for sustainability in everything we do, making sure that our advancements in CX and AI don't come at the cost of our environment.This photo, from the top of the world, is a reminder to me. It tells me that our work with AI and CX should mirror the balance and beauty of nature. It's a call to action to innovate responsibly, ensuring our technologies not only serve our customers but also protect our planet.Let's use AI and CX to create a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony, inspired by the breathtaking vistas like this one.hashtag#AI hashtag#CustomerExperience hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#Nature hashtag#Innovation","AI/Machine Learning,Customer centricity,User Experience",
