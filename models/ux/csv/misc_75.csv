"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain. She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""  So, this month, I'd like to honor all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters, as well as celebrate our unique cultures and backgrounds. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!",Not User Experience
