"Last week I reviewed more than 100 resumes for an opening we are working to fill. Here are some thoughts:1. Candidates have about one minute to make an impression with their resumes. Resumes should be clean, not cluttered.2. Tell me a story - your story! It's hard to tell a story with just bullet points. Give a short but sharp narrative - stay away from jargon.3. If you make a positive impression, know that I'm going straight to your LinkedIn profile. How are you presenting yourself on LinkedIn? Are you active? What are other people saying about you?",Not User Experience
