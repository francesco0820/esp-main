"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

She met my father while he was abroad serving in the Navy and moved to the United States with him to raise me and my sister, Maria. With very little extended family in a foreign country, my mother worked extremely hard to learn a new language, a new culture and a new way of life, always striving for the American Dream for herself and her family. Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

 Private hardware technology companies 
 Private banks 

And the benefit to the end user includes 
 no line times for ticket machines
 reduced cost by eliminating expired tickets
 increased turnstile velocity with an easier payment mechanism

It's still in trials with customers, meaning no meaningful revenue yet.Its flagship hardware product is the Galleon, a 40 ft. container of military-grade heavy gauge steel that can fit on a trailer and house 6 racks of GPUs for running AI models in remote environments like oil rigs, mines, and advanced combat ops bases. But it also offers its own app store of AI applications running at the edge, as well as software for managing the use of Space Starlink terminals.Armada also represents something of a comeback for CEO Wright, the former AppDynamics COO who resigned as CEO of AI software unicorn DataRobot last summer amid reported controversy around insider stock sales.And it represents an interesting, and possibly the first, effort by a startup to build on top of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, making them more commercially useful for media companies and others looking to stream video or run AI apps in remote locations.hashtag#edgecomputing hashtag#AI hashtag#edge hashtag#cloud hashtag#cloudcomputing hashtag#spacex hashtag#starlink hashtag#armada hashtag#armadagalleon hashtag#artificialintelligence hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#Industry hashtag#defense hashtag#venturecapital hashtag#VC hashtag#startups hashtag#tech hashtag#technology","User Experience,AI/Machine Learning"

"Ys Exciting News in AI: Apple Aims to Bring AI to iPhones YApple is making a bold move in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) by focusing on running AI directly on its hardware instead of relying on the cloud. In a recent research paper titled ""LLM in a Flash,"" Apple's researchers propose a solution to the current computational bottleneck of running large language models (LLMs) on devices with limited memory. This signifies Apple's intention to catch up with its Silicon Valley competitors in generative AI, a technology that powers applications like ChatGPT.Here are the key takeaways from Apple's research:Y1 Apple's research offers a solution to running LLMs on devices with limited memory, paving the way for effective inference on iPhones.Y1 Apple's focus on AI running directly on iPhones is a departure from its competitors, such as Microsoft and Google, who prioritize delivering AI services from their cloud platforms.Y1 This move by Apple aligns with the trend of AI-focused smartphones entering the market, with estimations of over 100 million AI-focused smartphones shipping by 2024.Y1 Bringing AI to smartphones has the potential to revolutionize the user experience, allowing for new innovations and anticipating users' actions.Y1 Running AI models on personal devices presents technical challenges, but it could result in faster response times, offline capabilities, and enhanced privacy.Apple's research paper offers a glimpse into the company's cutting-edge research and sets a precedent for future AI development. Optimizing LLMs for battery-powered devices is a growing focus for AI researchers, and Apple's approach opens doors for harnessing the full potential of AI in various devices and applications.As the AI landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for technology companies to ensure that the benefits of AI reach the widest audience possible.

"" Users connect their ""wallet"" to the physical product connected to a visual or electronic tag (RFID or NFC).Understanding the market:We have three types of technology providers enabling this:1.

It enables the exchange of real world assets without centralized intermediaries or hardware on the product.So what? YOnce a product has a unique ID and is on-chain, it's traceable, intelligent, and more valuable.Just imagine: A brand selling phygitals through a retailer could use the product to win back the customer relationship.The potential is limitless.What's next for consumer Web3?I'll soon drop a deep dive.Subscribe to get it: https://lnkd.in/e5W8x8QxFollow me for Web3 insights",User Experience

"I'm excited to share our latest pharmacy innovation- a brand new CenterWell Pharmacy App. It's a game changer that lets our customers manage their prescriptions anytime, anywhere, and however they want. Designed with seniors in mind, the simple user experience makes it easy for our patients to access their prescription refills, real-time order status, savings, transfers, and more. It takes the complexity out of something they do daily- staying on top of their prescriptions- which we know plays a big role in health outcomes and well-being.To my amazing team who made this possible for our customers, thank you! Tom Kirtz Daniel Polk Gaurav Khanna Craig Klopatek Dalia Powers The work you do every day to prioritize and focus on the health and well-being of our members is amazing and always appreciated.","User Experience,Human-centered design"

"2023 felt like a bit of a sea change for a creative leadership class that had moved into top design roles at many companies. What started as a trickle of outreach last Fall turned into a steady drumbeat of former colleagues reaching out to re-connect and reflect on their purpose, mission and the uncertain value of their hard-won experience in the current economic climate. I recognize that this is a community with extremely diverse backgrounds, experience and professional journeys. But, something collective is definitely happening that seems to transcend the basic reality of the latest economic cycle. What is the continuing role for specialized design leadership in business? Like many of you, I have been taking stock on the current state and what the path ahead looks like for many peers and friends, particularly in the coming age of AI. I have also been delighted to see a wave of new efforts to bring this community together and harness their creativity. So I used some time over the holiday break to step back, reflect and follow this story. The result is a two-part series over at Fast Company. The first part, which launched today, is my attempt to offer some observations on the current state of play and how we got here:https://lnkd.in/e3HTckksThe second part, which will go live in another week or two, looks at the proliferation of new platforms, networks and resources that are emerging to support this creative leadership diaspora, including: Neol, Design Leaders Community, Design Executive Council, Chief Design Officer School and others.I am extremely grateful to so many talented leaders and friends who have shared their wisdom, worries and whose journeys informed and inspired my thinking about the future of this incredibly talented community, including: Doug Powell, Lindsey Mosby, Greg Petroff, Scott Nazarian, John Rousseau, Denise Gershbein, Katrina Alcorn, Rachel K., Rob Magowan, Tim Brown, Kwame Nyanning, Liz Danzico, John Maeda, Thomas Mueller, Maria Giudice, Justin M., Ben Sheppard, UX Collective, Peter Merholz, Rosenfeld Media, Ryan Rumsey, I do not know if this story has been captured anywhere else, so it is my hope that this will increase the space for reflection.hashtag#designleadership hashtag#designleaders hashtag#uxleadership hashtag#designvalue","User Experience,Organizational Change Management"

"6 months ago, I shared my new role as the President and Co-Founder of Vale Health. Today, a lot of work from countless people allowed us to announce the first health system going live with their wellness marketplace. https://lnkd.in/gNEVh7yE 

As you will see, we started with better sleep as a health goal. We believe we are the first to really combine evidence-based wellness products, apps, and education with direct links to the clinical services of high quality health care providers into one experience. Now, people can have a trusted wellness marketplace linked to their trusted provider for their total health and wellness needs. 

Many more person-centered goals and categories are coming soon. You will also see the launch of the other founding health systems this year. 

These are still early days, and we know there is a lot to learn still, but I do want to pause today and thank the many people and organizations that came together to get us to the first milestone.

"Users prefer to learn by doing. Not by reading instructions. Every extra word is an opportunity for users to abandon the product. They have more important stuff to do.This is where intuitive design come into play.Let's break it down: 1. Intuitive Navigation: Design your interface in a way that feels natural to the user. Familiar patterns, like swipe to refresh or pinch to zoom, are more effective than instructions. 2. Visual Cues: Use icons, colors, and visual hierarchy to guide users. A well-placed arrow or a different button color can direct users more efficiently than text. Make sure that the design is also aesthetically pleasing. 3. Progressive Disclosure: Only show users what they need when they need it. Overloading them with information upfront is overwhelming. Gradually guide them through complex features. 4. Feedback Systems: Implement immediate feedback for user actions. If they press a button, make something happen. It's a non-verbal way of saying, ""Yes, you're doing it right."" 5. Testing and Iteration: Test your design with real users. What seems intuitive to you might not be for others. Iterate based on feedback to ensure your product truly minimizes the need for instructions. 6. In a world where attention spans are short, the best way to engage users is to let them dive right in.

"Up here, looking down from the peak of Aiguille Rouge at 3226 meters, it's hard not to be inspired. The mix of snow, sun, and clouds paints a picture of what balance looks like. It makes me think about how we can apply lessons from this stunning environment to the world of customer experience (CX), artificial intelligence (AI), and sustainability.I see AI as a powerful tool, like the sun lighting up these mountains, that can help us understand and cater to our customers better. We can use AI to predict what our customers need before they even know they need it. Like the way these clouds move and change, AI can help us be more adaptable and personalized in our approach.But, with great power comes great responsibility. Every innovation we make with AI needs to be weighed against its impact on our planet. Just as we marvel at the beauty of untouched snow, we need to protect the natural beauty of our world. We must strive for sustainability in everything we do, making sure that our advancements in CX and AI don't come at the cost of our environment.This photo, from the top of the world, is a reminder to me. It tells me that our work with AI and CX should mirror the balance and beauty of nature. It's a call to action to innovate responsibly, ensuring our technologies not only serve our customers but also protect our planet.Let's use AI and CX to create a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony, inspired by the breathtaking vistas like this one.hashtag#AI hashtag#CustomerExperience hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#Nature hashtag#Innovation","AI/Machine Learning,Customer centricity,User Experience"
