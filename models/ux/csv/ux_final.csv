"One of our Duolingo operating principles is test it first. I love the sheer scale of our testing; we run hundreds of simultaneous A/B tests to find new ways to teach more effectively. We have tens of millions of learners (just under 30M daily active users last quarter) and we use innovative thinking and experimentation to improve how we teach.Whenever we make a change to the Duolingo app, small or big, we first test to make sure it doesn't have a negative impact on our users or their ability to learn. We do the same for the course content, never making any change until it has been tested and shown to have positive effects on our learners' progress. But today, I want to talk about a class of experiments that surprised me. A few years ago, we started a team called   Delight  . Delight was not tasked with improving our metrics; its purpose was to make the app more delightful. This can be anything from:Animating the explosions that appear when you answer a hard question. Satisfying haptic feedback throughout your lesson Adding subtle sparkles across the appWe didn't expect these changes to have a positive effect on our numbers. But we tested them anyway. To our surprise, the animations do in fact keep people in the app longer and cause them to return to the app more often!  Delight facilitates learning , in ways we did not anticipate.Though we discovered that these animations *did* hurt the performance of one user segment: those who use Duolingo on lower-end devices. So we are able to turn off the more processing-intensive animations for these users to make sure their educational experience is not harmed 3Another thing I love about our experiment-driven culture is how it facilitates collaboration. When a cross-functional team (made up of product, engineering, design and others) has to move a metric, they brainstorm together   come up with multiple ideas and hypotheses   test them to see what moves the needle   and iterate  If you are an engineer who wants to contribute meaningfully to education, with a strong sense of how products can be continuously improved, you're one of us.

"Unlocking the Power of Enterprise Data with LLMsI've been diving headfirst into how large language models (LLMs) can supercharge the way we interact with enterprise data  and I'm blown away by the potential! Think about it: taking a powerful open-source LLM like Mistral and tailoring it to deliver actionable insights from your company's data. But here's the thing: it's not just about fancy text-to-SQL conversions. Building a truly impactful natural language interface for your data demands a multi-faceted approach:1.    LLM Mastery: Deep dive into prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, embeddings  the works!2.    Data Expertise: Know your relational databases inside out.

"2 tools that I see companies buying all the time that they may not need: Round Robin and Quota.Round Robin:This is a pretty easy one to build in Salesforce. With 2 custom objects and a flow, you can build your own Round Robin to evenly (or unevenly) distribute any kind of record to your team. Easy to maintain. Easy for users and managers.Quota: This is a big maybe for me on whether or not this should be built in Salesforce. Using the same framework, we have built really cool quota functionality that can quota off of opportunities, opportunity splits, revenue schedules, a custom object, etc. with different levels of quotas. (i.e. an individual quota rolls up to a team quota rolls up to a parent quota rolls up to a company quota). Both of these are really simple builds that will scale with you. So, the question always comes into play: Build or Buy. The answer is 'it depends,' but we have built out some really cool solutions for clients who chose to Build. We make recommendations, keep it simple and focus on user experience. That's where true expertise liesShoot me a note in the comments if you want to learn more about these.

"Great working with our Partner East Coast Canning + Printing on another project to bring ROPP Bottle and Standard Beverage Cans off the same Codi Filling Machine.  Been a long time coming with #wallabywater to make this happen.""Benefits of Aluminum Bottles Compared to PET"" Aluminum bottles have several advantages over PET bottles. For one, they are more durable and can withstand higher temperatures, which makes them ideal for storing hot liquids. Additionally, aluminum bottles are recyclable and can be reused multiple times, making them a more sustainable option. On the other hand, PET bottles are lightweight and easy to transport, but they are not as environmentally-friendly as aluminum bottles. Overall, if you are looking for a more eco-friendly and sustainable option, aluminum bottles are the way to go.Environmental sustainability: Aluminum bottles have a significantly lower environmental footprint compared to PET bottles. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable without loss of quality, meaning it can be recycled repeatedly without degradation. This promotes a circular economy and reduces the need for virgin materials, ultimately conserving natural resources and reducing energy consumption associated with manufacturing.Reduced plastic pollution: By opting for aluminum bottles, consumers contribute to reducing plastic pollution. PET bottles are a significant source of single-use plastic waste, which often ends up in landfills or pollutes oceans and waterways. Aluminum bottles offer a reusable alternative that helps mitigate the environmental impact of plastic pollution.Long-term durability: Aluminum bottles are highly durable and resistant to damage compared to PET bottles. They are less prone to cracks, punctures, or degradation over time, ensuring a longer lifespan with proper care. This durability makes aluminum bottles suitable for various activities and environments, including outdoor adventures, sports, and travel.Improved beverage quality: Aluminum is inert and non-reactive, meaning it does not leach harmful chemicals into the water stored within it. This ensures that the taste, odor, and overall quality of the water remain unaffected, providing a clean and refreshing drinking experience.Thermal insulation: Aluminum bottles offer superior thermal insulation compared to PET bottles.Aesthetic appeal and customization: Aluminum bottles often feature sleek designs and customizable options, allowing brands and consumers to express their individual style preferences. This aesthetic appeal can enhance the overall user experience and promote brand loyalty.Brand sustainability initiatives: By adopting aluminum bottles for water packaging, brands can align with these values and showcase their commitment to eco-friendly practices, which may resonate positively with consumers.#Alumi-tek #AluminumBottles #PackagingIndustry #SustainablePackaging",User Experience
"This was the start of Spotify.$60B of market cap today, just a wireframe at the start.""We started building the product. That's always what came first for us."" Daniel EkLet's rewind to get the full context: (As Daniel told Stockholm Tech Fest 2015)2002Daniel had the idea of Spotify when he experienced the magic of Napster. He loved the concept but hated the business model. He felt, ""Holy shit, this is what I want to do."" The timing just wasn't right. 2006Daniel and his co-founder Martin Lorentzon both had just sold their prior companies. They were figuring out what to build next. They eventually agreed there was a compelling opportunity to make Napster with the right business model.They started the company with a bunch of people at the KTH Royal Tech Institute in Stockholm. And they communicated a simple vision: ""Imagine having all the world's music in your iTunes library."" 2007One of the people making that vision a reality was lead designer Rasmuss Anderson (who has since gone on to also help design the first version of Figma). Working closely with the team, he created this iconic wireframe that defined the Spotify user experience:1. Launch app2. Login to spotify3. Personalize your homepage experience4. Discover & play unlimited musicBut the Spotify idea didn't start out this perfect. They iterated and iterated until they had something that would not just work, but delight users. The result is these early interactions still define the app we see today.2008After two years of iterating on the product, Spotify actually launched in Europe. The team waited until they could ""provide the best possible service."" And the result was wildfire. Spotify experienced hockey stick growth in Europe, went global in 2011, and public in 2018. The key lesson? Iterating on wireframes was done extensively before they ever wrote any code. This is a great takeaway for product builders of all types:Don't skip your wireframes!",User Experience

"A little customer experience story and a lesson.

Flight attendant: Beverage?
M: Sure, tea?
F: How do you like it?
M: (Struggling to find the word plain) just... tea.
F: Black?
M: Do you have mint?
F: No we don't have anything extra.
M: Sorry not extra to add, but mint tea. The flavor.
F: No we don't have anything extra.
M: Black tea is the only flavor you have?
F: Airlines are trying to recoup their losses, we only have one of everything.
M: OK thanks.
....
Meanwhile on my last flight.. Alaska has mint tea and several flavored seltzers, but I didn't want to break this man's heart. It's not his fault the airline has one kind of tea.

I assume in the current economy both airlines are cutting costs. But one airline is cutting costs that affect their passengers experiences. And on top of that, the struggle story is trickling all the way to seat 26D.

I didn't need an explanation. ""The flavor we currently have is black"", is a fine answer.

What we say internally, gets said externally. If you're telling your employees you're cutting back and you're trying to recoup losses, they may tell your customers.",User Experience

"Design is broken. Young and not-so-young designers are becoming increasingly aware of this. Many feel impotent: they were told they had the tools to make the world a better place, but instead the world takes its toll on them. Beyond a haze of hype and bold claims lies a barren land of self-doubt and impostor syndrome. Although these feels might be the Millennial norm, design culture reinforces them. In conferences we learn that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" but, when it comes to real-life clients, all they ask is to ""make the logo bigger.""

Silvio Lorusso's book 'What Design Can't Do' probes the disillusionment that permeates design. It tackles the deskilling effects provoked by digital semi-automation, the instances of ornamental politics fashioned to please the museum-educational complex, the nebulous promises of design schools.
