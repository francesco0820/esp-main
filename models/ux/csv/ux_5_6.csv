https://www.linkedin.com/in/durhamjulie/,"Last week, we experienced the ultimate Consumer Health Care – focused event, The inaugural Optum 💥""ConsumerCon”💥, where our teams of Product, Engineering, Design, Business and Operations collaborated to create outstanding digital experiences, and shape the future of customer-focused healthcare experiences ⚡🧡⚡ .
A huge THANK You to the cross UnitedHealth Group teams and leaders who came together to make this happen!

The two-day event was full of insights and learnings. Here are some of the highlights:
🧡 Rita Khan and I jointly shared the need for a unified consumer digital strategy, essential digital capabilities, and the value of data-driven insights.
🧡 Sandeep Dadlani shared valuable advice on how to avoid pitfalls that hinder a culture of fast innovation and growth at scale.
🧡 Professor Peter Fader led discussions on customer lifetime value and its power in creating the most important experiences for our members and patients
🧡 Katie Schumacher and Jared Carr led a session to identify solutions for key consumer pain points, and shared their “why” .
🧡 Chris Hanson turned product development into a fun, agile-building exercise with Lego models (who would have thought?)
🧡 Terry Clark showed us why it matters to advocate for solutions that meet individual healthcare needs.
🧡 Robbi Thatcher moderated a panel that brought insight from consumer advocates, who inspired all of us to be closer to our customers.
🧡 And finally, we engaged in a “design jam” with Anna Stoesz, Cindy Tam, and Bridget Feickert to learn more about rapid prototyping, the role of research, and top UX trends that emphasize iteration to support a continuous experience evolution.

A heartfelt thank you 🙏 to everyone involved in organizing ConsumerCon.!!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"Design is broken. Young and not-so-young designers are becoming increasingly aware of this. Many feel impotent: they were told they had the tools to make the world a better place, but instead the world takes its toll on them. Beyond a haze of hype and bold claims lies a barren land of self-doubt and impostor syndrome. Although these feels might be the Millennial norm, design culture reinforces them. In conferences we learn that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" but, when it comes to real-life clients, all they ask is to ""make the logo bigger.""

Silvio Lorusso's book 'What Design Can't Do' probes the disillusionment that permeates design. It tackles the deskilling effects provoked by digital semi-automation, the instances of ornamental politics fashioned to please the museum-educational complex, the nebulous promises of design schools.
