"Today marks an incredible day for our Siemens Mobility team and our rail manufacturing footprint in the United States.
Joined by national, state and local leaders, and colleagues Roland Busch and Marc Buncher, Siemens announced a $220 million investment in a new rail #manufacturing facility in Lexington, North Carolina. The facility will create more than 500 new jobs; deploy technologies enabling advanced manufacturing and carbon neutral operations; and provide us with a bicoastal #rail manufacturing presence to meet growing demand for passenger rail in America. Shoutout to our Sacramento plant, which has led our strong Made-in-America commitment for decades!
Making this announcement today had me thinking back to another big moment I got to be part of in November 2021 "" when President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. I was standing on the White House lawn, shoulder to shoulder with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, with labor partners and skilled workers, with cabinet officials, mayors and governors, and others from the private sector. And I thought to myself, you know, this is what it's all about: We're bringing people together to build the future.
On that day, something special happened. We shifted from vision-setting years for #infrastructure to a decade of action. Both government and business have stepped up. Bold investment is being matched by bold innovation. In fact, in just the past four years, Siemens has invested $3 billion in manufacturing expansions and acquisitions in the United States.
It's now time for the power of public-private partnerships to take off. It's at the state and local level where the long-term vision for what's possible with infrastructure becomes reality -- and Siemens and our 17,000 U.S. suppliers stand ready to support.
We are here to provide technologies that maximize of the impact of the investments and projects across infrastructure and industry now promising to shape a more sustainable, resilient, equitable future.

"We had a solid second quarter at Pfizer, and our financial results were in line with our expectations. We are more than halfway to our goal of launching 19 new products or indications in an 18-month span across a variety of therapeutic areas. Most importantly, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines in the first six months of 2023.
Patients are the reason we exist, and we never forget that the work we do is to help them.
- We continue our integration planning with Seagen and recently announced a new oncology R&D structure that we believe will help further accelerate our delivery of cancer therapies""because we know that when it comes to the battle against cancer: time is life.
- We are building on our acquisitions of Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics to help deliver solutions for immuno-inflammatory diseases, RSV, migraine, and sickle cell disease, respectively.

"It was an incredible honor for me to attend my first Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting last Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska, along with HP's CEO Enrique Lores and Tuan Tran, HP's President of Imaging, Printing & Solutions. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is an investor at HP. We heard directly from Buffett (92 years old) and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger (99 years old), who answered almost 60 questions directly from shareholders in the arena. They provided some phenomenal insights on investing and the current state of the economy. I particularly liked this quote from Buffett: ""The most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. You need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd.""

"Congrats to SOLARCYCLE on its $1.5M grant from the Biden Administration's U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to research how to maximize the vale of recycled metals and other materials in solar panels in a cost-efficient way.
SOLARCYCLE recovers 95% of the materials in decommissioned solar panels, including silver, copper, aluminum and glass, thereby diverting solar panels from being dumped in landfills while reducing greenhouse gasses and creating high-quality jobs.
As we race to replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy, building a stronger domestic solar supply chain will be essential. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that with a small amount of government support, recycled materials can meet up to 25-30% of domestic manufacturing needs in the years ahead.

"EY's recent ""C-suite insights"" piece on ESG and sustainability trends amongst executives gives a good overview of the direction of travel for especially US-companies:
a12 Integrating sustainability into the business model is now an imperative for every organization. ESG and sustainability priorities can deliver the transparency investors seek, the workplace cultures and practices that employees demand, and the focus on environmental issues that shape consumer behavior
a12 Half of respondents highlighted company sustainability initiatives around the development and commercialization of sustainable products, or the development of more agile and sustainable supply chains for the future of their businesses: a critical success factor to mitigate ongoing and predicted disruptions. As many as 82% of surveyed leaders confirm their organizations have both carbon emissions reductions initiatives in place and goals to reach net zero by a given year. And more than two out of five executives also reported a focus on sustainability and ESG initiatives more related to social equity, a key concern for employees, customers and other stakeholders.
a12 61% of leaders say addressing employee health and overall wellbeing is critical to the success of their organizations. Fifty-eight percent believe in addressing economic impact, including fair wages, and the vast majority (87%) of leaders support and report diversity in their workplace
a12 As investors now demand greater transparency from public companies, the regulatory landscape evolves and the SEC proposal for climate-related disclosures for public companies makes reporting more stringent, more organizations are seeing ESG and sustainability as a way to demonstrate commitment and enhance reputation beyond simply financial performance, focusing on supply chain, impact, carbon reduction or social equity

"YZYY China Opens the Door to Personalized Beauty YYYZ
I'm excited to share some major updates about Personalized Beauty in China.
Y In the last few months China has taken major steps to enable the growth of Personalized Beauty. In August 2022, Shanghai implemented ""Several Regulations on the Innovation and Development of the Cosmetics Industry in Pudong New Area"". This new regulation encourages cosmetics companies to explore small-batch, multi-variety, and highly flexible production models. SkinCeuticals is the first brand to obtain a license for in-store experience. Furthermore, in November 2022, the State Food and Drug Administration issued the ""Notice on Carrying out the Pilot Work of Personalized Cosmetics Services"", allowing personalized services for cosmetics to enter the ""fast lane"" in China. Those 2 initiatives indicate that China firmly supports ""personalized"" beauty at the governmental level.
Y These developments clearly indicate the potential of personalization for the Chinese beauty market (a $100b market). In 2022, we partnered with BCG on a global study about Personalized Beauty across all regions, and Chinese customers have demonstrated the highest interest in Personalized Beauty. With 94% of the surveyed customers likely to try personalized beauty and 69% willing to spend 20% or more for a personalized product, this is a huge addressable market and value-creation opportunity for the Beauty Industry.
Y This is where Prose comes in as the leader in Personalized Beauty.
At Prose, we believe that AI-powered personalization is a revolution that is transforming the beauty industry. Since 2017 we've developed our proprietary end-to-end platform to create personalized beauty products tailored to each individual's unique needs and preferences, with millions of customer profiles from all hair and skin types to train our algorithms. We're thrilled to lead this revolution and bring Personalized Beauty everywhere in the world.

"A Product Information Management (PIM) system is a software solution designed to centralize and manage all product-related data, such as product descriptions, attributes, item numbers, and pricing, in one location. Here are five reasons to use a PIM system:
1. Improved Product Data Management: A PIM system centralizes all product-related data, making it easier to manage and keep up-to-date. This can help to reduce errors and inconsistencies and improve data accuracy.
2. Increased Efficiency: By automating processes such as data entry and enrichment, a PIM system can help businesses save time and reduce manual effort. This can free up employees to focus on more value-added tasks, such as product development and customer engagement.
3. Data Harmonization and Consolidating Master Data: A PIM system can help to harmonize product data across multiple channels and consolidate master data across multiple ERPs, making it easier to manage, update, and distribute product information. This can lead to more accurate and up-to-date product information, improved efficiency, and better customer experience.
4. Multi-channel Consistency: A PIM system can help to ensure that product information is consistent across all channels and touchpoints, including e-commerce websites, marketplaces, and social media platforms. This can help to avoid confusion for customers and improve brand recognition and loyalty.
5. Streamlined Product Launch: By centralizing all product data and automating data processes, a PIM system can help to streamline the product launch process. This can reduce time spent on manual data entry and approval processes, enabling businesses to get products to market faster and more efficiently.

We heard about all of the emerging consumer and IT applications. Now, #AI has taken center stage. The world is buzzing about the potential disruption these emerging and converging digital tools will bring.
But what I really see happening now with the metaverse is some refocusing. There's a realization that people aren't looking to escape reality; they're looking for virtual environments and experiences that enable them to improve this real world we live in.
And this is a perspective that really energizes us as a focused technology company that combines the real and the digital worlds. We see this value proposition applying to market segment after market segment. And now we're embedding this strategy into what we call the #IndustrialMetaverse, which we're now working to advance with partners such as NVIDIA.
