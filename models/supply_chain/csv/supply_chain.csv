"ðŸ”® Embrace the Future of (Personalized) Beauty! ðŸ”®
I've just wrapped up an energizing conversation with industry leaders at the CEW (Cosmetic Executive Women) panel, moderated by Rachel Francois St. Fleur, where we took a deep dive into the exciting trajectory of personalized beauty.
Personalized beauty is a nascent field, and over the next 5 years, I envision 3 game-changing dimensions that will unequivocally reinforce why Personalized Beauty works better!
1ï¸âƒ£ Battle for Data Domination - Possessing an extensive, qualitative data set can be a strong defensive moat. Direct-to-consumer strategies are crucial to acquiring proprietary data, which can be activated through AI to provide superior personalized experiences. Various data sources, such as consultations, environmental data, computer vision, self-testing, and sensor technology, offer potential for the industry. Data quality, ownership, and consumer adoption are key factors in enhancing personalized beauty solutions. See my article below.
2ï¸âƒ£ Scale of micro-manufacturing systems - enabling a paradigm shift in where customization occurs - from the fulfillment centers (current Prose model) to the point-of-sale, and ultimately, transitioning to the intimate space of consumers' bathrooms to enable a daily and mono-dose personalization.
3ï¸âƒ£ The rising integrated product-service modality, hinged on AI, aiming to revolutionize personalization. The emergence of beauty AI-Powered Assistants and vertical super-apps will layer a multitude of services atop the personalized product offering.
I find myself fascinated by the unfolding ""Battle for Data Ownership"", a competition I believe holds the power to shape the industry's future. The pursuit of data ownership can reinforce market defensibility, potentially nudging us towards a 'winner-takes-all' scenario.
Stay tuned for my next post where we deep-dive into the scale of micro-manufacturing systems. Let's shape the future of personalized beauty together! ðŸ’„ðŸ”¬

"We are hearing so much about the impact of #AI in consumer spaces and the rise of large language models. For our program in Washington Post Liveâ€™s â€œThe Futurist: The Rise of AI,â€ I wanted to focus on an area that maybe isnâ€™t as well-known: industrial AI.
Thanks to Brian Harrison, Senior Director of Omniverse Digital Twins at Nvidia, who I interviewed for yesterdayâ€™s segment.
I asked Brian how industrial AI differs from consumer applications. Our views are aligned that industrial AI distinguishes itself in how factory teams are applying it with purpose to address specific problems theyâ€™ve identified. This is creating new value for manufacturers and enhancing peopleâ€™s productivity.
A great example Brian shared was how AI was being used by a company to address a high number of false positives for faulty electronics parts during acceptance testing. AI processed high data volumes create massive training sets for testing equipment that increased accuracy above 99 percent, improving efficiency.
The amount of data produced by a factory is exponentially greater than what we typically find in consumer environments, and AI in combination with digital twins is a powerful tool for leveraging this data.
Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing Siemens and NVIDIA continue to push the edge together, as we combine our capabilities to create an #IndustrialMetaverse where #manufacturing, engineering and design will one day innovate at the speed of software. Is Mooreâ€™s Law coming to the industrial world?",Supply chain
"For decades, we saw American manufacturing get redistributed to other countries. But this is a new era.
Our $150 million investment in a new high-tech plant in Texas â€“ announced today with Roland Busch â€“ shows how American manufacturing is growing again in the United States.
Think about what weâ€™ve experienced in just the past few years. Weâ€™ve seen disruption in global supply chains reinforce the need to not be overly reliant on one region for sourcing critical items. Supply chain challenges have been a factor in evolving globalization into â€œglocalization.â€ Itâ€™s a world that's ever more global, ever more connected, but where we're capable of manufacturing things closer to the point of demand.
Siemensâ€™ growth in the United States over the past year â€“ investing $500 million in our U.S. #manufacturing footprintâ€“ reflects this. And thereâ€™s a lot more driving this than supply chain trends.
First, thereâ€™s the impact of digital technologies. In the last decade, we saw digital technologies transform our personal lives and the consumer world. Now theyâ€™re coming to industry and #infrastructure. We see the rise of AI and 5G and cloud in consumer spaces â€“ but also igniting transformation and growth in critical infrastructure markets. What weâ€™ve thought of as more traditional industries are joining forces with the tech sector. With this growth comes new high-tech factories that create jobs and strengthen local economies.
Second, weâ€™re seeing all of this accelerated by government investment in infrastructure, manufacturing and climate. Government investment is sending a strong signal to the private sector. And Siemens is among the companies investing.
This is an exciting day for Siemens and for the resurgence of American industry.",Supply chain
"Today marks an incredible day for our Siemens Mobility team and our rail manufacturing footprint in the United States.
Joined by national, state and local leaders, and colleagues Roland Busch and Marc Buncher, Siemens announced a $220 million investment in a new rail #manufacturing facility in Lexington, North Carolina. The facility will create more than 500 new jobs; deploy technologies enabling advanced manufacturing and carbon neutral operations; and provide us with a bicoastal #rail manufacturing presence to meet growing demand for passenger rail in America. Shoutout to our Sacramento plant, which has led our strong Made-in-America commitment for decades!
Making this announcement today had me thinking back to another big moment I got to be part of in November 2021 â€“ when President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. I was standing on the White House lawn, shoulder to shoulder with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, with labor partners and skilled workers, with cabinet officials, mayors and governors, and others from the private sector. And I thought to myself, you know, this is what itâ€™s all about: Weâ€™re bringing people together to build the future.
On that day, something special happened. We shifted from vision-setting years for #infrastructure to a decade of action. Both government and business have stepped up. Bold investment is being matched by bold innovation. In fact, in just the past four years, Siemens has invested $3 billion in manufacturing expansions and acquisitions in the United States.
Itâ€™s now time for the power of public-private partnerships to take off. Itâ€™s at the state and local level where the long-term vision for whatâ€™s possible with infrastructure becomes reality -- and Siemens and our 17,000 U.S. suppliers stand ready to support.
We are here to provide technologies that maximize of the impact of the investments and projects across infrastructure and industry now promising to shape a more sustainable, resilient, equitable future.

"What a great week having our global leader Roland Busch with us in the U.S. for meetings, an #OptimisticOutlook podcast recording (more on that to come), and a very big announcement: our $220 million investment in a new rail manufacturing hub in Lexington, N.C.
Iâ€™ll share just one quick takeawayâ€”that in the announcement we saw a core theme in our meetings become a reality: our world is becoming more â€œglocal.â€ Like the internet fueled globalization, shifting many American manufacturing to other countries, technologies now coming of age and supply chain realities will be every bit as influential in *localizing* production here in the U.S.
Now, as Roland said, this doesnâ€™t mean decoupling â€“ taking production from one area and moving it elsewhere. Rather, it means that, as the transformation of industry and infrastructure accelerates â€“ and as global events spotlight the need for supply chain resilience â€“ global production networks are now diversifying. Companies are growing their overall manufacturing capabilities and, as glocalization takes hold, choosing to do this closer to the point of the demand.
Which is exactly what we see in Lexington! Siemens is meeting growing U.S. demand for rail by tapping into rail innovation that's been tested and continually refined across our global team, then bringing production close to our East Coast customers. This provides Siemens with a bicoastal #manufacturing presence!
This is only the start of glocalization and the benefits weâ€™ll see to jobs, our economy, and to sustainability. And Iâ€™m so proud to be part of #TeamSiemens in this moment where we can make such a significant impact.

"Today at MIT Media Lab, I shared a joke that introduces a section in the sci-fi tale Ready Player One. ""I'm not crazy about reality, but it's still the only place to get a decent meal.""
Hereâ€™s why I think this quote is timely. The #metaverse came to the gaming world 20 years ago. Two years ago, we saw the metaverse at the forefront of tech industry headlines.
We heard about all of the emerging consumer and IT applications. Now, #AI has taken center stage. The world is buzzing about the potential disruption these emerging and converging digital tools will bring.
But what I really see happening now with the metaverse is some refocusing. Thereâ€™s a realization that people arenâ€™t looking to escape reality; theyâ€™re looking for virtual environments and experiences that enable them to improve this real world we live in.
And this is a perspective that really energizes us as a focused technology company that combines the real and the digital worlds. We see this value proposition applying to market segment after market segment. And now weâ€™re embedding this strategy into what we call the #IndustrialMetaverse, which weâ€™re now working to advance with partners such as NVIDIA.
Think about everything we learned during the pandemic about the need for more resilient supply chains and more localized #manufacturing. The industrial metaverse will provide us with what we need: the ability to invent anywhere and to transmit our creativity everywhere.",Supply chain

"Congrats to SOLARCYCLE on its $1.5M grant from the Biden Administration's U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to research how to maximize the vale of recycled metals and other materials in solar panels in a cost-efficient way.
SOLARCYCLE recovers 95% of the materials in decommissioned solar panels, including silver, copper, aluminum and glass, thereby diverting solar panels from being dumped in landfills while reducing greenhouse gasses and creating high-quality jobs.
As we race to replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy, building a stronger domestic solar supply chain will be essential. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that with a small amount of government support, recycled materials can meet up to 25-30% of domestic manufacturing needs in the years ahead. Excited to see how quickly SOLARCYCLE is growing to meet this need!",Supply chain
"Great article and video showing how SOLARCYCLE is creating an industrial-scale recycling process for solar. This diverts old panels from going to the landfill, reduces carbon pollution from making new panels, builds the supply chain for domestic solar manufacturers, and creates lots of jobs in the process.

"One year ago today, we launched Amazon Clinic with the mission to make health care easier and more accessible. By connecting customers to trusted, high-quality telehealth providers and offering choice and price transparency, we believed we could create a different health care experience â€” one that is focused on the customer. Amazon Clinicâ€™s 24/7 virtual health care marketplace connects customers (via the Amazon website or mobile app) to third-party, licensed clinicians who quickly provide affordable and trusted care for more than 35 common health concerns. Customers browse a list of available telehealth providers and select the one that best meets their schedule and budget, then connect directly via message- or video-based consultation. They can receive the treatment they need, whenever and wherever they need it, in minutes and hours vs. days or weeks. And weâ€™ve continued to expand our â€œwhat, who, and how.â€ We launched with message-based consultations in 32 states and now offer video visits nationwide for more than 35 common conditions. Since launch weâ€™ve grown our list of treatable conditions, and decreased patient wait times and cost. Weâ€™ve doubled our roster of third-party telehealth providers. All of this has contributed to a 97% customer satisfaction rating. Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the team behind Amazon Clinic and their relentless customer obsession and commitment to delivering a world-class service. We made great progress in our first year and canâ€™t wait to share what weâ€™re building for year 2. At Amazon, we're no strangers to tackling complex challenges. We start with a core customer need and work backwards to build innovative solutions. Step one of our Amazon Health Services journey was removing common barriers to accessing medication by leaning into Amazonâ€™s world-class logistics capabilities with the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. Next, we leveraged our unique ability to create a marketplace and connect customers to the products and service they need through Amazon Clinic. Lastly, weâ€™ve leaned into our ability to create a delightful membership experience for customers with One Medical. Weâ€™re using the best of Amazon to make it easier for customers to get care, get meds, and stay healthy. As we build the everything store for health, we see this as an important first aisle.

"For as long as Iâ€™ve worked in the industry, thereâ€™s been a belief that consumerism would fix all that ails American healthcare.
Consumerismâ€™s strong proponents believe that patientsâ€”operating more like shoppers for other goods and servicesâ€”will unleash the power of competition to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
There are a number of reasons that consumerism has failed that go largely undiscussed:
The Market For Clinical Care Is Inelastic
In other markets for goods and services, new entrants join the market when thereâ€™s an opportunity. In the United States, the supply of clinicians is largely inelastic because of our system of regulating healthcare professionals. The number of medical school, residency, and fellowship positions is largely fixed and not particularly dynamic. It takes, for example, 10 years to produce a new gastroenterologist (4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship). If we really wanted to test the idea that competition could improve outcomes and lower costsâ€”we might open our borders to physicians from other countries and not require them to retrain in the US system (as the state of Tennesse is now doing) or expand allowable scope of practice between disciplines of medicine.
Consolidation & Poor Anti-Trust Enforcement
All segments of healthcare have undergone massive consolidation in the last 20 years. Communities that previously had choices of 5-6 hospitals now have 1 large health system in its place. Physicians who previously practiced independently are now parts of big health systems. These systems exist to elevate selling power with payers and keep prices high. Health plans, for their part, have done the same thing and consolidated as wellâ€”and patients in some markets have many fewer choices than they once had of plans, hospitals, and medical groups. A functioning market requires lots of players in order for prices to move elastically.
There Are Massive Information Assymetries
In order to have a functioning market for healthcare goods and services, patients need information about the quality of services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, such information is mixed in quality. Why? Quality measures capture only a small fraction of the clinical scenarios that are relevant to patients. There are literally 100,000s of different clincial scenarios and it is near impossible to measure the skill/capability of a clinician or health system at managing all of these clinical scenarios. Averages may/may not be helpful fo patients in understanding whether a clinician or health system is best at managing their particular scenarios. While there have been efforts to introduce greater transparency, these efforts are surface level at bestâ€”not for lack of effort, but because it is so complex. And there remains more art than science in many clinical scenarious making defining a â€œgold standardâ€ very difficult.
Do you still believe â€œconsumerismâ€ can fix what ails American healthcare?",Supply chain

â—½ Integrating sustainability into the business model is now an imperative for every organization. ESG and sustainability priorities can deliver the transparency investors seek, the workplace cultures and practices that employees demand, and the focus on environmental issues that shape consumer behavior
â—½ Half of respondents highlighted company sustainability initiatives around the development and commercialization of sustainable products, or the development of more agile and sustainable supply chains for the future of their businesses: a critical success factor to mitigate ongoing and predicted disruptions. As many as 82% of surveyed leaders confirm their organizations have both carbon emissions reductions initiatives in place and goals to reach net zero by a given year. And more than two out of five executives also reported a focus on sustainability and ESG initiatives more related to social equity, a key concern for employees, customers and other stakeholders.
â—½ 61% of leaders say addressing employee health and overall wellbeing is critical to the success of their organizations. Fifty-eight percent believe in addressing economic impact, including fair wages, and the vast majority (87%) of leaders support and report diversity in their workplace
â—½ As investors now demand greater transparency from public companies, the regulatory landscape evolves and the SEC proposal for climate-related disclosures for public companies makes reporting more stringent, more organizations are seeing ESG and sustainability as a way to demonstrate commitment and enhance reputation beyond simply financial performance, focusing on supply chain, impact, carbon reduction or social equity
