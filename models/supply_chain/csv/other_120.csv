"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from â€œpure merit.â€
Usual arguments for â€œpure meritâ€ include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measureâ€”we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someoneâ€™s resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to sayâ€”whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the landâ€”we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI

"ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒŸ China Opens the Door to Personalized Beauty ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰
Iâ€™m excited to share some major updates about Personalized Beauty in China.
ðŸ‘€ In the last few months China has taken major steps to enable the growth of Personalized Beauty. In August 2022, Shanghai implemented â€œSeveral Regulations on the Innovation and Development of the Cosmetics Industry in Pudong New Areaâ€. This new regulation encourages cosmetics companies to explore small-batch, multi-variety, and highly flexible production models. SkinCeuticals is the first brand to obtain a license for in-store experience. Furthermore, in November 2022, the State Food and Drug Administration issued the â€œNotice on Carrying out the Pilot Work of Personalized Cosmetics Servicesâ€, allowing personalized services for cosmetics to enter the â€œfast laneâ€ in China. Those 2 initiatives indicate that China firmly supports â€œpersonalizedâ€ beauty at the governmental level.
ðŸ¤“ These developments clearly indicate the potential of personalization for the Chinese beauty market (a $100b market). In 2022, we partnered with BCG on a global study about Personalized Beauty across all regions, and Chinese customers have demonstrated the highest interest in Personalized Beauty. With 94% of the surveyed customers likely to try personalized beauty and 69% willing to spend 20% or more for a personalized product, this is a huge addressable market and value-creation opportunity for the Beauty Industry.
ðŸ‘‰ This is where Prose comes in as the leader in Personalized Beauty.
At Prose, we believe that AI-powered personalization is a revolution that is transforming the beauty industry. Since 2017 weâ€™ve developed our proprietary end-to-end platform to create personalized beauty products tailored to each individualâ€™s unique needs and preferences, with millions of customer profiles from all hair and skin types to train our algorithms. Weâ€™re thrilled to lead this revolution and bring Personalized Beauty everywhere in the world.

"Today concludes this yearâ€™s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos. Itâ€™s been an honor to meet with industry and policy leaders to help shape the partnerships needed to tackle the challenges facing the world today. This yearâ€™s theme was â€œCooperation in a Fragmented World,â€ and in both casual conversations and official presentations there was clear agreement that the challenges addressed in Davos will require unprecedented levels of cooperation between governments, research institutions, NGOs, and many other entities.
The eventâ€™s organizers not only acknowledged the importance of cooperation in the abstract sense, but pointed specifically to increased cooperation between governments and business as essential to solving a range of economic, energy, and food crises.
Weâ€™ve had a close working relationship with WEF for 20 years, and much of our recent collaboration has focused on these very issues. For example:
â€”Weâ€™re exploring the many ways that food system transformation can alleviate poor nutrition, reduce carbon emissions, create good jobs, and reduce waste. As we note, public/private partnerships and action-oriented multi-stakeholder coalitions will become increasingly important if we are to understand, assess, and navigate the trade-offs in complex food system transformations.
â€”Our Circular Transformation of Industries initiative, launched in collaboration with WEF, INSEAD, and the University of Cambridge, explores how leaders can scale efforts in circularity (the economic model based on reduce/reuse/recycle), going beyond current small-scale partnerships that limit impact to more inclusive models that dramatically accelerate results.
â€”Discussions at WEF also underscored the importance of policy in driving decarbonization and energy transition. Attendees noted the Inflation Reduction Act should prove truly transformative for the United States, and expressed hope that other regions will step up their policy support. We continue to work with WEF on a number of climate initiatives, including the Leaders for a Sustainable MENA (Middle East North Africa) group, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, and our joint research into voluntary carbon markets.
As a global organization with nearly 20,000 employees, we are committed to reducing our own environmental footprint. Last year we achieved carbon net negative status, and we continue to take our decarbonization and sustainability efforts further. At Davos I saw similar passion and commitment among many of the attendeesâ€”quite a few of whom are, Iâ€™m proud to say, our friends and clients. I know the challenges we face are not easy, but I remain confident that even in these fragmented times we can achieve virtually anything when we all work together.

"ðŸ’¥ INÃ‰DIT - C'est la 1Ã¨re fois dans le monde qu'une banque est attaquÃ©e en justice pour sa contribution aux dÃ©rÃ¨glements climatiques.
AprÃ¨s avoir envoyÃ© en octobre dernier une mise en demeure Ã  BNP Paribas, nous attaquons la banque en justice pour non respect de son devoir de vigilance en matiÃ¨re climatique, avec Les Amis de la Terre France et Notre Affaire Ã  Tous, Oxfam France .
Depuis..
- 10 ans on Ã©change avec #BNP
- 5 ans le Gouvernement refuse de rÃ©guler les banques
- 3 mois on a mis en demeure BNP
On passe donc Ã  la vitesse supÃ©rieure !
Pourquoi BNP ?
- Elle a une empreinte carbone Ã  la France entiÃ¨re
- C'est la 1ere banque au monde Ã  financer 8 grandes entreprises du pÃ©trole et gaz, comme Total, BP, Shell...
BNP nous a rÃ©pondu fin janvier. Mais sa rÃ©ponse est insuffisante pour rÃ©pondre aux exigences scientifiques Ã©lÃ©mentaires : est-ce que la banque demande Ã  ses entreprises clientes de cesser de dÃ©velopper de nouveaux projets de pÃ©trole et gaz ?

In May 2023, we achieved another significant milestone: Prose turned PROFITABLE! And just a few months later, in August, we outdid ourselves by reaching a mid-single-digit EBITDA, surpassing our own goals for this year!
Still, a lot to aspire to when looking at the industry's top players, but this is a monumental leap for us and demonstrates that a well-executed D2C model can be both dynamic and profitable.
A lot of the credit goes to our relentless focus on productivity enhancements (Thank you Anthony Perdigao and Ops teams!!) and strategic initiatives: the successful launch of our Skincare line in April has been a direct catalyst (Kudos to Megan Streeter, Paul Michaux and Marketing & Digital teams for this amazing launch!!).
But I couldnâ€™t let this moment pass without extending a heartfelt 'Thank You' to our stellar FP&A team: Genevieve Chow, Katharine Nicosia, Catherine Kernan, our Accounting team: Robyn S., Daphne Liu, Keith, and Venice Franco and a special shoutout to our CFO, Michael Nathenson, for steering the ship with precision and dedication over the last 2-3 years!

We are seeking members from all corners of the state, with individuals who have experience in business, agriculture, conservation, economic protection, and other relevant stakeholders, who will give voice to Minnesotans who have historically not had a voice in decisions impacting Minnesotaâ€™s climate.
The board has 15 members who will be appointed by Governor Walz. They will serve from September 2023 through April 2025, with meetings each quarter. Board members also serve as important advocates to communities across the state to help Minnesotans understand and take action to protect our climate â€“ and our childrenâ€™s future.

"I'm excited to share our work examining the use of AI to predict whether colorectal cancer has spread elsewhere just by looking at the primary tumor tissue itself.
In this study, we use clustering of machine-learned embeddings to generate human-interpretable visual features of tumor regions, and then select those features that add the most in predictive value when combined to known clinical and pathological variables associated with cancer spread. In this way we prevent simply selecting visual features corresponding to what is already known.
We demonstrate that this approach does indeed boost predictive performance, can improve risk stratification of cancer patients, and use visual analysis of the selected features to build on work suggesting the interaction of fat and tumor may be important in tumor behavior and outcome.
