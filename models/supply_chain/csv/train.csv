"Are you ok? It's a simple question that carries a lot of weight, and during #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth and beyond, it's so important to check in with each other and ourselves. This past weekend, I had the opportunity to do just that. Thanks to ServiceNow's commitment to living our best lives, our entire company had a wellbeing day on Friday that allowed me to get outside and do what I love to do to help with my mental health--exercise. As a family, in honor of Memorial Day, we enjoyed the annual walk we do every year.
Prioritizing yourself is not always easy. As a working mom/parent, I understand. Please know that you are not alone if your mental health is deteriorating. There's no shame in asking for help. So, I'll ask you again: are you ok? #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth #wellbeingmatters",

"Y Embrace the Future of (Personalized) Beauty! Y
I've just wrapped up an energizing conversation with industry leaders at the CEW (Cosmetic Executive Women) panel, moderated by Rachel Francois St. Fleur, where we took a deep dive into the exciting trajectory of personalized beauty.
Personalized beauty is a nascent field, and over the next 5 years, I envision 3 game-changing dimensions that will unequivocally reinforce why Personalized Beauty works better!
1i a Battle for Data Domination - Possessing an extensive, qualitative data set can be a strong defensive moat. Direct-to-consumer strategies are crucial to acquiring proprietary data, which can be activated through AI to provide superior personalized experiences. Various data sources, such as consultations, environmental data, computer vision, self-testing, and sensor technology, offer potential for the industry. Data quality, ownership, and consumer adoption are key factors in enhancing personalized beauty solutions. See my article below.
2i a Scale of micro-manufacturing systems - enabling a paradigm shift in where customization occurs - from the fulfillment centers (current Prose model) to the point-of-sale, and ultimately, transitioning to the intimate space of consumers' bathrooms to enable a daily and mono-dose personalization.
3i a The rising integrated product-service modality, hinged on AI, aiming to revolutionize personalization. The emergence of beauty AI-Powered Assistants and vertical super-apps will layer a multitude of services atop the personalized product offering.
I find myself fascinated by the unfolding ""Battle for Data Ownership"", a competition I believe holds the power to shape the industry's future. The pursuit of data ownership can reinforce market defensibility, potentially nudging us towards a 'winner-takes-all' scenario.
Stay tuned for my next post where we deep-dive into the scale of micro-manufacturing systems. Let's shape the future of personalized beauty together! YY

The USMCA can be a model for how the U.S., Mexico and Canada can capitalize on our close regional ties, but it will require all three governments to live up to and uphold the spirit of the agreement. The rewards are worth it""if the USMCA works as intended, it can help address bigger geopolitical challenges and strengthen our supply chain resiliency.

"""Resilient supply chains in a dynamic world"" was the topic of this year's DHL Forum, and I had an insightful fireside chat with Will Heywood, VP of DHL Supply Chain.
We discussed lessons learned during the chaotic times of the pandemic and how #SupplyChains have transformed over the last four years. Throughout our discussion, one thing remained constant: the need to embrace change.
Times of disruption give us the best opportunity to shape the future, and as I shared with Will, digitalization and industrial technologies are driving new ways we're thinking about supply chains and #manufacturing at Siemens.
Amid #SupplyChain disruptions, we've seen that the future of the industry is what I've been calling "" glocal.' Global innovation is and will continue to be essential, but local production capabilities will be vital to increasing resilience against future disruptions.

"Today concludes this year's World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos. It's been an honor to meet with industry and policy leaders to help shape the partnerships needed to tackle the challenges facing the world today. This year's theme was ""Cooperation in a Fragmented World,"" and in both casual conversations and official presentations there was clear agreement that the challenges addressed in Davos will require unprecedented levels of cooperation between governments, research institutions, NGOs, and many other entities.
The event's organizers not only acknowledged the importance of cooperation in the abstract sense, but pointed specifically to increased cooperation between governments and business as essential to solving a range of economic, energy, and food crises.
We've had a close working relationship with WEF for 20 years, and much of our recent collaboration has focused on these very issues. For example:
""We're exploring the many ways that food system transformation can alleviate poor nutrition, reduce carbon emissions, create good jobs, and reduce waste. As we note, public/private partnerships and action-oriented multi-stakeholder coalitions will become increasingly important if we are to understand, assess, and navigate the trade-offs in complex food system transformations.
""Our Circular Transformation of Industries initiative, launched in collaboration with WEF, INSEAD, and the University of Cambridge, explores how leaders can scale efforts in circularity (the economic model based on reduce/reuse/recycle), going beyond current small-scale partnerships that limit impact to more inclusive models that dramatically accelerate results.
""Discussions at WEF also underscored the importance of policy in driving decarbonization and energy transition. Attendees noted the Inflation Reduction Act should prove truly transformative for the United States, and expressed hope that other regions will step up their policy support. We continue to work with WEF on a number of climate initiatives, including the Leaders for a Sustainable MENA (Middle East North Africa) group, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, and our joint research into voluntary carbon markets.
As a global organization with nearly 20,000 employees, we are committed to reducing our own environmental footprint. Last year we achieved carbon net negative status, and we continue to take our decarbonization and sustainability efforts further. At Davos I saw similar passion and commitment among many of the attendees""quite a few of whom are, I'm proud to say, our friends and clients. I know the challenges we face are not easy, but I remain confident that even in these fragmented times we can achieve virtually anything when we all work together.

"An OMS, or Order Management System, is a software solution that streamlines and automates the various stages of an order's lifecycle, from order placement to fulfillment and delivery. It enables businesses to efficiently manage orders from multiple channels, such as e-commerce platforms, physical stores, and marketplaces, while also integrating with other essential systems such as inventory management, warehouse management, and customer relationship management.
An OMS can improve the efficiency and accuracy of your order processing, which will enhance customer satisfaction and increase overall revenue. Here's how:
- Evaluate needs - Determine your business requirements, such as order volumes and product types
- Choose the right OMS - Select a system that meets your needs, considering factors like scalability and integration capabilities
- Integration - Connect the OMS with existing systems, such as e-commerce platforms and inventory management
- Monitor and optimize - Review OMS performance and make adjustments as needed
Does your company have an integrated OMS in your ERP or a standalone solution?

"What a great week having our global leader Roland Busch with us in the U.S. for meetings, an #OptimisticOutlook podcast recording (more on that to come), and a very big announcement: our $220 million investment in a new rail manufacturing hub in Lexington, N.C.
I'll share just one quick takeaway""that in the announcement we saw a core theme in our meetings become a reality: our world is becoming more ""glocal."" Like the internet fueled globalization, shifting many American manufacturing to other countries, technologies now coming of age and supply chain realities will be every bit as influential in *localizing* production here in the U.S.
Now, as Roland said, this doesn't mean decoupling "" taking production from one area and moving it elsewhere. Rather, it means that, as the transformation of industry and infrastructure accelerates "" and as global events spotlight the need for supply chain resilience "" global production networks are now diversifying. Companies are growing their overall manufacturing capabilities and, as glocalization takes hold, choosing to do this closer to the point of the demand.
Which is exactly what we see in Lexington! Siemens is meeting growing U.S. demand for rail by tapping into rail innovation that's been tested and continually refined across our global team, then bringing production close to our East Coast customers. This provides Siemens with a bicoastal #manufacturing presence!

Governments are looking to invest in more secure and reliable systems to safeguard and diversify the global #supplychain. Investment across the entire supply chain is needed for true risk reduction.

"I'm excited to share our work examining the use of AI to predict whether colorectal cancer has spread elsewhere just by looking at the primary tumor tissue itself.
In this study, we use clustering of machine-learned embeddings to generate human-interpretable visual features of tumor regions, and then select those features that add the most in predictive value when combined to known clinical and pathological variables associated with cancer spread. In this way we prevent simply selecting visual features corresponding to what is already known.
We demonstrate that this approach does indeed boost predictive performance, can improve risk stratification of cancer patients, and use visual analysis of the selected features to build on work suggesting the interaction of fat and tumor may be important in tumor behavior and outcome.

Its not every day you have the opportunity to gather so many incredible companies in the same room, but thats exactly what we did when we launched our new supplier program this week. Not only did we introduce leaders from key suppliers to Kenvue as a stand-alone company, giving the event an extra-special energy, but around every corner we found new ways to grow together, including supporting our Healthy Lives Mission. Were leaving that room with a shared vision for the future.

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from ""pure merit.""
Usual arguments for ""pure merit"" include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measure""we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someone's resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to say""whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the land""we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms. Because when we fail to do so, we rob ourselves of access to the kind of transformational talent we need to challenge our own broken status quo.",DEI

"For as long as I've worked in the industry, there's been a belief that consumerism would fix all that ails American healthcare.
Consumerism's strong proponents believe that patients""operating more like shoppers for other goods and services""will unleash the power of competition to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
There are a number of reasons that consumerism has failed that go largely undiscussed:
The Market For Clinical Care Is Inelastic
In other markets for goods and services, new entrants join the market when there's an opportunity. In the United States, the supply of clinicians is largely inelastic because of our system of regulating healthcare professionals. The number of medical school, residency, and fellowship positions is largely fixed and not particularly dynamic. It takes, for example, 10 years to produce a new gastroenterologist (4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship). If we really wanted to test the idea that competition could improve outcomes and lower costs""we might open our borders to physicians from other countries and not require them to retrain in the US system (as the state of Tennesse is now doing) or expand allowable scope of practice between disciplines of medicine.
Consolidation & Poor Anti-Trust Enforcement
All segments of healthcare have undergone massive consolidation in the last 20 years. Communities that previously had choices of 5-6 hospitals now have 1 large health system in its place. Physicians who previously practiced independently are now parts of big health systems. These systems exist to elevate selling power with payers and keep prices high. Health plans, for their part, have done the same thing and consolidated as well""and patients in some markets have many fewer choices than they once had of plans, hospitals, and medical groups. A functioning market requires lots of players in order for prices to move elastically.
There Are Massive Information Assymetries
In order to have a functioning market for healthcare goods and services, patients need information about the quality of services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, such information is mixed in quality. Why? Quality measures capture only a small fraction of the clinical scenarios that are relevant to patients. There are literally 100,000s of different clincial scenarios and it is near impossible to measure the skill/capability of a clinician or health system at managing all of these clinical scenarios. Averages may/may not be helpful fo patients in understanding whether a clinician or health system is best at managing their particular scenarios. While there have been efforts to introduce greater transparency, these efforts are surface level at best""not for lack of effort, but because it is so complex. And there remains more art than science in many clinical scenarious making defining a ""gold standard"" very difficult.
Do you still believe ""consumerism"" can fix what ails American healthcare?",Supply chain

We bought the remaining shares owned by our founders and became 100% employee-owned through our ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan).
It still gives me goosebumps. After 44 years, our founders, John Wolgamott and Jerry Zink, have passed on their legacy to all of us...the employee-owners of StoneAge.
Not only are we helping our employees create meaningful wealth by sharing in the company's success, but we are also building a world-class culture of engagement and teamwork. We are creating a sustainable, forward-thinking company committed to improving the lives of its employees.
Being employee-owned drives and shapes our daily work ethic, and we couldn't be more excited to continue serving and innovating our industries as one united team.
This photo only shows half of our outstanding team as we gathered worldwide last week to celebrate this significant milestone in our company's history. But every one of us was there in spirit.
Congratulations to the StoneAge and Breadware teams! I can't wait for what comes next!

"For decades, we saw American manufacturing get redistributed to other countries. But this is a new era.
Our $150 million investment in a new high-tech plant in Texas "" announced today with Roland Busch "" shows how American manufacturing is growing again in the United States.
Think about what we've experienced in just the past few years. We've seen disruption in global supply chains reinforce the need to not be overly reliant on one region for sourcing critical items. Supply chain challenges have been a factor in evolving globalization into ""glocalization."" It's a world that's ever more global, ever more connected, but where we're capable of manufacturing things closer to the point of demand.
Siemens' growth in the United States over the past year "" investing $500 million in our U.S. #manufacturing footprint"" reflects this. And there's a lot more driving this than supply chain trends.
First, there's the impact of digital technologies. In the last decade, we saw digital technologies transform our personal lives and the consumer world. Now they're coming to industry and #infrastructure. We see the rise of AI and 5G and cloud in consumer spaces "" but also igniting transformation and growth in critical infrastructure markets. What we've thought of as more traditional industries are joining forces with the tech sector. With this growth comes new high-tech factories that create jobs and strengthen local economies.
Second, we're seeing all of this accelerated by government investment in infrastructure, manufacturing and climate. Government investment is sending a strong signal to the private sector. And Siemens is among the companies investing.

"We are hearing so much about the impact of #AI in consumer spaces and the rise of large language models. For our program in Washington Post Live's ""The Futurist: The Rise of AI,"" I wanted to focus on an area that maybe isn't as well-known: industrial AI.
Thanks to Brian Harrison, Senior Director of Omniverse Digital Twins at Nvidia, who I interviewed for yesterday's segment.
I asked Brian how industrial AI differs from consumer applications. Our views are aligned that industrial AI distinguishes itself in how factory teams are applying it with purpose to address specific problems they've identified. This is creating new value for manufacturers and enhancing people's productivity.
A great example Brian shared was how AI was being used by a company to address a high number of false positives for faulty electronics parts during acceptance testing. AI processed high data volumes create massive training sets for testing equipment that increased accuracy above 99 percent, improving efficiency.
The amount of data produced by a factory is exponentially greater than what we typically find in consumer environments, and AI in combination with digital twins is a powerful tool for leveraging this data.
