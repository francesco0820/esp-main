At NOMOQ, we're thrilled to see this progress towards a more sustainable future. And as advocates for a higher recycling rate in food and beverage packaging, we're aligned with the EU's vision for a circular economy.

In a similar move, Canada's Single-Use Plastics Prohibition Regulations aim to eliminate certain single-use plastics by 2030 to achieve zero plastic waste.

This news reaffirms our commitment to providing high-quality, fully recyclable cans for brands who share our passion for sustainability. How?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Our mission has always been to revolutionise digital can printing, making it accessible to beverage brands of all sizes. With our 'No Minimum Order Quantity' approach, we're breaking barriers and empowering creativity, while championing sustainability.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Our state-of-the-art technology transforms aluminium cans into stunning works of art, fully recyclable without labels or plastic sleeves. We are proud to be among the first globally, and the first in Europe, to pioneer this eco-friendly solution.

Stay tuned as we continue to lead the way in supplying decorated cans in small batch sizes for the beverage market. Together, let's create a more colourful and sustainable world, one can at a time.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamstowitts/,"Last week I graduated from The University of Nebraska with two master's degrees: an MBA with a finance specialization, and a Master of Science in Business Analytics.

This was an incredibly rewarding experience.¬†My roles in my 30+ year career have generally been highly technical.¬†Finance and Analytics were both interesting fields that I knew would make me better as a technical and operations leader.

My experience at Nebraska College of Business was outstanding.¬†When I first started looking at programs, I was primarily interested in curriculum, particularly in these areas of finance and analytics.¬†Which program included the classes that I thought I would enjoy taking?¬†Nebraska was the best choice for me easily, offering a great selection of classes and a dual degree program that allowed additional coursework in both areas of study that I was interested in.¬†¬†It is also a tremendous value ‚Äì having been ranked as high as #1 in the country for value among online MBA programs in recent years. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.

I‚Äôm very appreciative of the support I received (both generally and financially) by my employers: originally Ball Metalpack and then by acquisition Sonoco Products.  Both organizations have been incredibly supportive of continuing education.

The support from my family was awesome.¬†This was a demanding journey that I was trying to navigate ‚Äì with a wife and three young children at home, and a senior leadership role in my day job.¬†For the last four years, I dedicated 4am ‚Äì 6am every day + additional weekend hours as needed to my studies.

This entire experience was completed, start to finish, while I was in my 50‚Äôs.¬†I was almost always the oldest student in my classes and often older than the professor.¬†There were lots of opportunities to share professional experiences in these classes, and I like to think I brought many interesting ones to our discussions.

What next?¬†Well, 50-something years old is not too old to go back to school, and not too old to keep working at my most important job, as Dad.¬†Mallory and I will welcome our 4th child in the next few weeks, right before my 54th birthday!

If you‚Äôve been kicking around the idea of going back to school:¬†do it!¬†It‚Äôs never too late to keep learning!¬†I couldn‚Äôt be more excited about my path over the last few years.

 Finally ‚Äì if you‚Äôre worried that my years with Nebraska might have changed my college football priorities ‚Äì well, I always cheer for the Irish first on Saturday.¬†But when they aren‚Äôt playing‚Ä¶.

This lesson has stuck with me, and as I watch my boys grow into young men with their own interests and responsibilities, I see its importance even more clearly. It‚Äôs a principle that translates directly into our team culture and our success.¬†Managing family responsibilities and professional commitments can be challenging, but it‚Äôs that challenge that makes us stronger and more effective.

I could not have asked for a better growing experience than that of the State Street Board who has been consistently ranked among the top 25 global boards. As I start serving on boards you will remain my North Star on how an effective board should operate. I would like to thank Dame Amelia Fawcett DBE, CVO Lead Director, Sean O'Sullivan Chair Tech & Ops Comm & Marie Chandoha Chair Risk Comm. Sean, I will forever treasure your support & guidance.

Thanks Ronald O'Hanley, for your support for diversity & inclusivity. #FearlessGirl continues to fearlessly inspire thousands everyday.

Steven Fay CPC Federal Reserve Bank Boston, you & your team were highly supportive & appreciative of my efforts, very grateful. Tough, when needed, but collaborative, you embody how effective regulators should operate, both ensuring the smooth functioning of the US Financial System, while challenging the industry to get better. Thanks Michael Bertulli, Ed Charlton, Linda Lue-Bezzat, Janele Cooper & Jeffrey Baglioni

To former colleagues,
Lou Maiuri, you rock. Never met an executive who can operate so effectively from board room to the mail room, from the ‚ÄúC‚Äù suite to the ‚ÄúCoding"" suite & everything in between. To Andrew Kuritzkes what an unbeatable second act !!, as CRO for the nation‚Äôs CHIPS program your impact will last decades. Thank you Barbara Diette, Wynne Rumpeltin, Kris Wulteputte, Ajay Mathur, Mark Corteil, Jacqueline Angell, my risk comrade in arms

Thanks to my business partners over the years for keeping a risk mindset - Brian Franz, John Plansky, Antoine Shagoury, Sarah Berwick, Ram Puppala, Ann Fogarty, Adeel Saeed, Elizabeth Joyce, Andrew Zitney, Aman T., James Hardy, Jit Vekaria & Kishore Kottapalli.

As leaders we are only as good as our teams - leaders look tall because they are being carried by Giants. To my team of giants, I am so incredibly proud of all that we have achieved. You have punched way above your weight class & helped establish one of the best cyber/tech/3rd party/resilience/operational risk programs in the industry. You did it by advising business leaders on how to get to YES rather than saying NO. Thank you Gnana Chavali - especially for boot strapping our Center of Excellence (CoE), thanks Sandip Biswas, Richard Flood, Alain Gresse, David Smith, Dewayne Sharp.

To the global non-financial risk team, you defined what seamless & operating as one means. Your espirit de corps was the engine that drove the group. Each major crisis is different 9/11 to 2008 financial Meltdown to Covid, threats change from cyber/climate/AI. One thing I have learned over the years, is that risk is never constant & always shape shifting. What is constant & does not shift, is how an agile, data driven, team of risk professionals can help a firm overcome these crises & emerge stronger. You have done that and more.

Great to spend time with clients from JPMorganChase Mutual of Omaha Bank Rockland Trust Newmark CoBank Protective General Insurance Services, now part of OSC Insurance Services at a great game where the Washington Nationals lost narrowly, 8-7 to the New York Mets

Great to attend the National Flood Insurance Program FEMA Conference to understand flood risk to every property, how to make properties and communities more resilient and how to leverage AI to help achieve these goals.

At CoreLogic we leverage AI to innovate ‚Ä¶

Where every property attribute counts like first floor height (a major contributor to understanding flood risk in relation to the topology of the adjacent land)‚Ä¶

Where every pixel counts - where we use image analytics to identify wildfire resiliency factors on properties in California to reduce wildfire insurance premiums by up to 20% (e.g factors like fence is 12 feet away, no flammable materials within 5 feet and identifying enclosed roof eaves)

Where every property counts - use supercomputing to understand the financial risk to every property due to climate change ‚Ä¶ initially up the year 2050 - enables regulators to shape policy, investors/lenders assess risk, insurers price premiums and set resilency factors to reduce premiums.

This is CoreLogic 2.0

There, Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics, explained that, in a world where uncertainty and complexity prevail, it is crucial to approach predictions with humility. As Daniel Kahneman wrote in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, ""A plan for the future is an act of faith that cannot be based on certainty."" Recognizing the limitations of our own knowledge and understanding can prevent us from falling victim to overconfidence and bias, allowing for more accurate and nuanced predictions. By maintaining a humble attitude towards our predictive abilities and leading with curiosity, we open ourselves up to learning from mistakes and adjusting our strategies accordingly. Ultimately, humility in prediction-making is not a sign of weakness, but rather a strength that leads to more thoughtful and insightful decision-making.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilbhatt/,"We are incredibly proud to share that our Chief Product & Technology Officer, Gene German, has authored a groundbreaking article featured in Chief Healthcare Executive.

Gene‚Äôs article dives deep into the pivotal role of AI and prepayment #claims editing in revolutionizing payment accuracy and creating significant value for health plans.

üí° Key Takeaways:

üîπ AI‚Äôs Transformative Power: The integration of AI and predictive analytics is crucial for enhancing payment accuracy and reducing administrative costs.

üîπ Data-Driven Healthcare: As healthcare generates 30% of the world‚Äôs data, AI‚Äôs potential to harness this data for transformative solutions is immense.

üîπ Addressing Payment Challenges: Innovative AI tools are essential for tackling rising healthcare costs, administrative waste, and fraud.

üîπ Collaborative Innovation: Effective solutions arise from deep industry expertise and genuine partnerships, addressing specific challenges such as state Medicaid compliance and genetic testing claims.

Gene‚Äôs perspective underscores a critical shift in healthcare payment integrity towards prepay solutions, enabled by AI. This approach minimizes the need for costly post-payment interventions and fosters better payer-provider relationships.

As we navigate this dynamic landscape, it‚Äôs essential for industry leaders to embrace AI-driven solutions that not only improve efficiency but also enhance care quality.

The future of payment integrity will be defined by collaboration, innovation, and the strategic use of advanced technologies.

https://linkedin.com/in/beverly-steele-72a8173/,"I‚Äôve met a few noteworthy people in my life, but none of them have had a significant impact on me (personally or professionally). That all changed yesterday.

While waiting in the lobby to see my eye doctor, a man walks in and greets the staff like they are family. He laughed with everyone, knew everyone‚Äôs names, shared jokes with them, and treated them like his own.

When I first looked his way, I knew I recognized him. It looked like Richard Davis, but I didn‚Äôt want to say anything. For those of you that don‚Äôt know Richard Davis, he was the CEO of U.S. Bank during the financial crisis and how he led the company through it truly inspired me.

At that time, all major banks were roiling because of the market crash and the failures of multiple financial institutions. As strong as U.S. Bank was, the company was not immune to feeling the impacts. Instead of cutting jobs like many other banks were doing at the time, he offered a different solution. Everyone will take a 5% pay cut and nobody loses their job. I was just a 20 hour teller at the time while I was going to school. I really didn‚Äôt have any sense of how significant that idea was until I looked back on it. Everyone gave a little bit so that we could all make it through the hard times together. That last word, together, is the key part.

Mr. Davis‚Äô leadership and example has inspired me throughout my career. First and foremost he taught me that employees are not just numbers or financial burdens, they are the members of a work family and are the key to a successful business. Happy employees are more productive and ultimately produce better results. While at the helm of U.S. Bank, he truly believed in that philosophy and it permeated throughout every level of the organization.

Returning to my story from earlier, the office staff called him by name. ‚ÄúHey Rich!‚Äù At that moment, I knew it was, indeed, Richard Davis. I greeted him by name, he quickly stood up and shook my hand, and we shared a conversation. I also knew I couldn‚Äôt pass up an opportunity to get a photo with him. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt dressed the best, but who likes to go to the doctor in work clothes?

It was an honor to meet you, Mr. Davis!",https://linkedin.com/in/beverly-steele-72a8173/,MISC,,Image,Beverly,Steele,U.S. Bank,Banking,"SVP, Operations Digital & CX Leader¬†",2024-07-01 16:24,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207939002019041281,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQG1-7KOayeTVw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718475087592?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=Dc6djuf2ai0LMc9yACFklTSPqF7fdhhG0jrbxOSAFmY,,,,,1748,209,13,2w,,,,Beverly Steele likes this,Likes,,2024-06-16 02:56,,,,,,,,,Sunday,6:56 AM,6/16/2024,Sunday,,Engagement,6-7am,,,,,,1970,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

https://linkedin.com/in/beverly-steele-72a8173/,"It's week two of summer break in our household. And that means we're in full swing of summer sports, camps and lake time with my three kids.¬†My entryway is a sign of the times, piled high with Crocs, sports gear and swim goggles.

While I love summer (who doesn't in the Land of 10,000 Lakes), I have to admit it requires a serious shift in my mindset as a working parent. The mental gymnastics required to manage all the logistics of who is going where and when is real - and some days it feels like a part-time job! And don't get me started on managing the budget for ice cream, Starbucks and Culvers runs.

At Brillect, we have several (and might I add rock star) consultants who have opted to take the summers off.¬†Some of them have done it for years; others are trying it for the first time this summer. But the common thread between all of them is that taking the summers off is a win for them, their families and our clients.

I believe that work life integration comes in all shapes, sizes and seasons. Finding that right-size role starts with listening to what people need in order to thrive at work + in life. Because there's more to us than our job titles.

We're a company made up of triathletes, pilots, pickleball fanatics, canoe craftsman and yes, parents who are juggling all the things in the busy summer season.

Some people may want the time off to care for children while others have booked a bucket list trip or want to finish a passion project.

No matter what the reason, we keep our focus on the whole person - not just the work person - to shape a career that recognizes where they're at in life.

Here's to summer and finding time for all the things that bring us joy.

‚ÄúI hear from a lot of trans and gender nonconforming people, dress code is often used as a smokescreen to justify homophobia and transphobia,"" says artist and public speaker ALOK Vaid-Menon.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still this idea that our appearance is conflated with our legitimacy...with our ability to do a good job,"" ALOK says. ""We need to disentangle that.""

ALOK says that often queer or trans people are penalized or punished for being ""visibility emotional, visibly queer, visibly trans in the workplace."" They say, don't underestimate that, but also don't underestimate the power of queer and trans leadership in the workplace.

""It begins with an individual saying, 'I‚Äôm not going to tolerate this,' and recognizing that creates ramifications and reverberations for all people.""

https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandy-brown-03b6277/,"As a founder, I often get asked ‚Äì how did you come up with your company name?   While I typically use this to crack some dumb dad-joke, the reality is the name will find you.

When we named XUP (pronounced ‚Äòzup‚Äô), it was after whiteboarding up a thousand plus names, multiple languages and meanings‚Ä¶but what really happened is someone was being funny and then an unfortunate spelling mistake that led to the name. Eventually, we came up with the ‚Äòpublic‚Äô story which was the ‚ÄúX‚Äù stood for transactions and we drive them UP! So XUP!

Now that we‚Äôre on to pAIwares (pronounced pay-wares), it was MUCH easier. We knew AI was going to be on the platform, we were software and in payments‚Ä¶so after a few URL availability searches, pAIwares.com was available and it stuck. Okay, we had one teammate who didn‚Äôt like it, but he eventually came around.

Some say naming your company is exciting while others say it‚Äôs daunting. Either way, pick one that you can get behind with an available URL, and don‚Äôt be afraid of people not pronouncing it correctly. As long as they‚Äôre calling you something close, you‚Äôre in the game.

Starting the week with this very thoughtful HBR article. Great read. My biggest takeaways-

üí™ ‚Ä¶move beyond promoting those with the most competence and start thinking more about those who can get you where you want to go.
üí™‚Ä¶start considering those who have high potential, not just top performers.
üí™‚Ä¶biggest assumption, attributes that have made someone successful so far will continue to make them successful in the future. Not true anymore. 
üí™‚Ä¶successful leaders remain open to adapt and continually learn. It‚Äôs what I call the #3Astrategy. Adjust, Adapt and Accomplish.
üí™‚Ä¶every company needs different types of leaders at different times, and someone who performs well in their current role may not be the right person to help you reach your most immediate goals.

So what‚Äôs your top takeaway after you read this piece? Thanks in advance for sharing and building on our learnings.

Takeaways:
‚Ä¢	Based on McKinsey‚Äôs research, companies with leading digital capabilities outperform those that are behind by two to six times on total shareholder returns.¬†Great stat, but something that tech providers need to focus on in their individual projects is ùê≠ùê´ùêöùêßùê¨ùê•ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùêßùê† ùê≠ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùê†ùêûùêßùêûùê´ùêöùê•, ùêöùê©ùê©ùê•ùêû ùê©ùê¢ùêû ùê¨ùê≠ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê¨ùê≠ùê¢ùêú ùê¢ùêßùê≠ùê® ùê°ùê≤ùê©ùêûùê´-ùê´ùêûùê•ùêûùêØùêöùêßùê≠ ùê≠ùêûùê´ùê¶ùê¨ their customer can get excited about and help them measure and prove the value.
‚Ä¢	McKinsey identifies six capability areas necessary for transformation:¬†1) Strategy, 2) Talent, 3) Operating Model, 4) Technology, 5) Data, and 6) Adoption and Scaling.¬†The descriptions of each of these begin to clarify why digital transformation is so hard.¬†Each area, taken on its own, is a big lift, and to truly achieve lasting competitive advantage, a business must address all six (‚ÄúCompanies don‚Äôt necessarily need to be exceptional in every capability, but they do need to hit a baseline of competency across all of them.‚Äù)¬†Truly developing a core competence around digital and AI is what I like to call a ‚Äúhigh degree of difficulty vault.‚Äù¬†High risk and high reward.¬†Again, ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêØùê¢ùêùùêûùê´ùê¨, ùê∞ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêùùêÆùêúùê≠ùê¨ ùêöùêßùêù ùê¨ùêûùê´ùêØùê¢ùêúùêûùê¨ ùêúùêöùêß ùê≤ùê®ùêÆ ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêØùê¢ùêùùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùê•ùê®ùê∞ùêûùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê´ùê¢ùê¨ùê§?
‚Ä¢	Of the six capabilities, McKinsey says, ‚ÄúIt is telling that the largest gaps are in creating a strategic road map to realize value and in adoption and scaling, as opposed to in technology:¬†ùêõùêûùê¢ùêßùê† ùê¨ùêÆùêúùêúùêûùê¨ùê¨ùêüùêÆùê• ùê¢ùêß ùêùùê¢ùê†ùê¢ùê≠ùêöùê• ùêöùêßùêù ùêÄùêà ùê¢ùê¨ ùê•ùêûùê¨ùê¨ ùêöùêõùê®ùêÆùê≠ ùê≠ùêûùêúùê°ùêßùê®ùê•ùê®ùê†ùê¢ùêúùêöùê• ùê≠ùê®ùê®ùê•ùê¨ ùêöùêßùêù ùê¶ùê®ùê´ùêû ùêöùêõùê®ùêÆùê≠ ùê°ùê®ùê∞ ùê∞ùêûùê•ùê• ùêõùêÆùê¨ùê¢ùêßùêûùê¨ùê¨ ùê•ùêûùêöùêùùêûùê´ùê¨ ùêöùê•ùê¢ùê†ùêß ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¢ùê´ ùê®ùê´ùê†ùêöùêßùê¢ùê≥ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß.‚Äù¬†Ding ding ding.
‚Ä¢	The most important point:¬†As the authors write, ‚ÄúUnderstanding what to do is one thing‚Ä¶these capabilities are well known to most executives.¬†Understanding how to actually build those capabilities is another.‚Äù¬†Yes.¬†This is a massive opportunity for tech providers.¬†How can we more safely lead our clients through to realization of the value of technology?¬†We don‚Äôt need more/better thought leadership ‚Äì we all get it!¬†ùêàùê¶ùêöùê†ùê¢ùêßùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêØùêöùê•ùêÆùêû ùêüùê®ùê´ ùêö ùêúùê•ùê¢ùêûùêßùê≠ ùê¢ùêß ùêö ùê©ùê´ùê®ùêØùê¢ùêùùêûùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùêúùêöùêß ùêúùê•ùêûùêöùê´ùê•ùê≤ ùê¢ùêùùêûùêßùê≠ùê¢ùêüùê≤ ùêöùêßùêù ùê¶ùê¢ùê≠ùê¢ùê†ùêöùê≠ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùê®ùê¨ùêû ùê´ùê¢ùê¨ùê§ùê¨ ùêöùêßùêù ùê©ùêöùê´ùê≠ùêßùêûùê´ ùê∞ùê¢ùê≠ùê° ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¶ ùê≠ùê® ùê≠ùê´ùêÆùê•ùê≤ ùêöùêúùê°ùê¢ùêûùêØùêû ùê•ùêöùê¨ùê≠ùê¢ùêßùê† ùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùêûùê≠ùê¢ùê≠ùê¢ùêØùêû ùêöùêùùêØùêöùêßùê≠ùêöùê†ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùê´ùê®ùêÆùê†ùê° ùêùùê¢ùê†ùê¢ùê≠ùêöùê• ùê≠ùê´ùêöùêßùê¨ùêüùê®ùê´ùê¶ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß.

I recently had the privilege of attending a fireside chat at Atlas School, hosted by Aaron Smith, M.Ed. and featuring insightful discussions with industry leaders from BOK Financial: Garrett Guthrie, CDR, Amy Brown, Brent Lewis, and Sean Medlin. This event was a fantastic opportunity to network and learn about the future of technology and banking.

Key Takeaways:

üè¶ Community-Driven Banking: The speakers highlighted the importance of local initiatives, starting right here in Tulsa.

üöÄ Innovative Projects: From supporting consumer and mobile web development to introducing new features that set them apart from competitors, the focus is on staying modern and effective over the next 10-15 years. Critical milestones include the modernization of payment infrastructure and addressing technical debt within the software engineering team.

üè¢ Data Center Modernization: A significant three-year initiative to modernize data centers.

üõ°Ô∏è Challenges:

#Cybersecurity: Developers are being trained in secure coding practices, making cybersecurity the top priority across the bank.

#FraudDetection: Dedicated teams are continuously monitoring for fraudulent activities.

#AIUtilization: Emphasizing the responsible use of AI.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Focus:

Technical Skills: Importance of real #problemSolving skills in technical interviews, rather than mere memorization.

Soft Skills: Not to be overlooked, with a focus on #authenticity and the ability to #mentor the next generation.

üíº Interview Insights:

Constantly evaluate if the role is the right fit, treating the interview process as a two-way street.

Success in the first 60-90 days involves building relationships.

üî• This event was an incredible learning experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with such inspiring professionals from BOK Financial. A big thank you to the Career Services department for organizing this insightful session. Looking forward to applying these insights in my own career journey!

Zimmerman Savill, but it‚Äôs a small world and I have a feeling we‚Äôll all cross paths again.¬†I also want to especially thank Javier Jimenez and Stephanie Reisinger for bringing me into the Flatiron team - this was a tremendous experience.¬†I also want to thank the Executive team, and especially Nathan Hubbard, for allowing me to help shape the Flatiron scientific structure and ensuring that all these critical decisions supported Flatiron‚Äôs optimal path forward. 

I plan to take the month or two off from full-time Epidemiology work and instead, roll up my sleeves to provide some caregiving to my parents and hopefully also give my kids more of my time than they probably even want this summer and helping to develop some good core memories. 

In a perfect world, I will be looking to jump back into full-time work by mid/late August (hopefully in time to attend ISPE) and I‚Äôm absolutely open to discussion on what that work might be (epidemiology, data strategy, drug safety, CSO, etc.) as I do not have anything definitely lined up for my next role.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/carazocarlos/,"What an amazing week last week at Edison Electric Institute's 2024 conference.  It was the first time I attended this conference and will definitely be back!  Special thanks to Pedro Pizarro, Maria Pope, Calvin Butler, Dan R. Brouillette and the rest of the EEI Board for hosting Jensen Huang and me for a very thought-provoking lunch, followed by a great fireside chat between Pedro and Jensen discussing the future of Energy and the role #AI will play. 

So many great discussions with utility leaders and especially enjoyed my panel discussion with Hema Sundaram, Neva Espinoza, Maria Robinson hosted by Mary Sprayregen on AI: The Next Big Opportunity for Collaboration.  It was clear that utilities will benefit from open industry specific generative AI models that can be leveraged to help the entire industry move faster towards meeting our clean energy goals. 

AI is poised to revolutionize the utilities sector in numerous ways. By harnessing the power of AI, utilities can optimize grid management, enhance predictive maintenance, and improve demand forecasting. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, allowing for quicker decision-making and more efficient resource allocation. This leads to increased operational efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced reliability of energy supply. Additionally, AI can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources by predicting their availability and managing their intermittency, thus supporting the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

Generative AI will play a crucial role in this transformation. Gen AI can create advanced predictive models and simulations, enabling utilities to better anticipate and prepare for various scenarios. It can also automate complex processes, reducing human error and freeing up resources for more strategic tasks. Furthermore, Gen AI can enhance customer engagement by providing personalized recommendations and solutions, thus improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. The potential of Gen AI in driving innovation and efficiency in the utilities sector is immense and will be a key factor in achieving our clean energy goals.

Was also excited to see the team from Deloitte and Utilidata announce a partnership to scale the Karmen distributed AI platform.   A software defined grid is a sustainable grid.  An open platform like Karmen allows for third party players to join in helping provide innovative applications that will reduce costs to rate payers while providing more resilient, reliable, secure and sustainable operations.

Here are some parting thoughts after saying goodbye to Newport Beach: 

ü§ù There is an undeniable, shared desire among #utilities, #cleanenergy developers, and regulators to collaborate on the critical choke points facing the #energytransition. 

One of my favorite quotes of the week came from Vistra Corp.'s Cathleen Colbert: ""I think about this like a ship. You can't just turn a ship on a dime."" 

On that front, it was great to see California ISO and California Public Utilities Commission so well-represented across the event. Big thank you to Jill Powers and Gabe Petlin for making this happen.

‚òÄ California is a global leader in fighting #climatechange, but there's much work to be done. One of our keynote speakers, Scale Microgrids co-founder Tim Hade, made the case that ""Climate action is war, and California is Normandy."" Check out this recap of his remarks here: https://lnkd.in/eYaqyTHf

I still cant believe that I was honored by the Governor of South Carolina Henry McMaster with the 'Excellence in Scientific Awareness' award. I am incredibly thankful to the SC Academy of Science (especially to President April Heyward, MRA), and words can never express my gratitude.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-f-green-6041758/,"Yesterday at the Women‚Äôs Conference, I was honored to receive the SHEro award for Equity. This award is given to someone who has worked to promote and advance equity in the workplace. To be nominated and recognized by some of my peers for this has been an incredibly humbling (and surreal!) experience.

The women‚Äôs conference has been the most inspiring 2 days, and I take home with me so many kernels of wisdom for my professional and personal life. I am so honored to work alongside such thoughtful individuals, who aside from their day to day work, take on more to make the workplace and employees better. 

I think Maria Pia Tamburri said it best on day 1 of the women‚Äôs conference, when after her interview at Dominion Energy, she went home and told her husband that Dominion had good people. I echo this thought: Dominion has good people to work with and great people to know. I‚Äôm so fortunate to call so many of my colleagues my friends.

Lastly, a special shout out to my DEV Operations Support team who rallied for the occasion! I‚Äôve never felt so celebrated by my peers and my leadership.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-f-green-6041758/,"May 22, 2024 was truly a monumental day for Dominion Energy.  This date marked the installation of the first monopile foundation with 170+ to follow through 2026 for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (CVOW).   These monopiles are nearly the height of the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument combined!

When completed, this wind facility will provide clean energy to 660,000 customers; thereby, eliminating millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. 

Thanks to all the project managers, engineers, technical and environmental specialists, supply chain, legal, accounting and many others who are dedicating their time to this project. 

Some companies talk about making a difference for the future, other companies take the bold steps to make it happen!

Proud to work at a company that takes bold steps to make our tomorrows cleaner and better!!!!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheryl-maletich-90980924/,"""When persistence meets innovation, even the smallest steps can lead to great success.


In a world filled with challenges, the story of the crow dropping stones into a jar to raise the water level teaches us a profound lesson: persistence and innovation can overcome even the toughest obstacles. ü™®üíß

Just like the crow, we often face situations where the solution isn't immediately apparent. However, with determination and a bit of creative thinking, we can find ways to reach our goals. Each stone the crow drops might seem insignificant on its own, but together, they make a significant impact. This reminds us that small, consistent efforts can lead to remarkable achievements over time. üê¶üöÄ

So, whenever you feel stuck or overwhelmed, remember the crow and its clever strategy. Keep pushing forward, think outside the box, and never underestimate the power of perseverance. Every step you take brings you closer to success. üåüüåç

As we celebrate Pride Month I encourage you to educate and bring along those who oppose the tenants of this month long celebration; inclusion, acceptance, joy, belonging, diversity.  These projectors of supposed 'virtue', who exist in most organizations and societies and who we all unfortunately have contact with, are the creators of exclusionary constructs that want to control you, maintain power and exert self-righteous mores rather than partner, grow and develop you as an individual.  They exist to the detriment of social, corporate and organizational cohesion.  Projected virtue in this sense is merely the marriage of caution and hypocrisy.  Speak openly about this hypocrisy to reveal to them and the world that  diversity is the reality of the human condition, even when they don't want to see it.  We are more successful as a species and a society when the full rainbow is seen!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-donovan-3229184/,"I'm reflecting on my experience at the Analytics Leadership Consortium (ALC) Summit, hosted by the International Institute for Analytics in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic - and here are my key takeaways:

First - CAO Albert Marinez shared that the value in data & analytics at their institution is recognized by leaders beyond his sphere, quoting their CEO Tom, ""Data are the vital signs of the organization."" D&A at the Clinic is viewed as a shared enterprise service; leaders like Albert work hard to engage everyone with their data and assets, recognizing the power it holds for its 81,000 global caregivers/workforce.

Second - while prioritizing speed alone has led some companies into irreversible consequences, the Clinic champions good governance as a means to accelerate AI innovation. (Joseph Dorocak, ASA, MAAA & Kevin Mooney, Esq.) From embedding principles into model development to developing enforceable standards, their deep dive was invaluable.

Third - we covered quite a bit of ground, from implementing ethical AI frameworks and integrating GenAI into existing roadmaps, to quantum computing (that's Jack Phillips & I in front of IBM Quantum System One) and VR training as a means to up-skill on the ""soft stuff"" (read: communication skills) in healthcare. Many questions remain for me, but this is the one that's loudest right now: How does a large, complex organization adhere to varying (EU, USA, etc.) regulatory mandates across its global presence AND accomplish some form of standardization?

TL;DR? This is your reminder to separate the signal from the noise. Cleveland Clinic is a beacon of forward-thinking in healthcare analytics.

üëè Special thanks to Albert Marinez, Andrew Proctor, Lisa Teti, James Simon MD, MBA, Kevin Mooney, Esq., Randy Geise, and all of the incredible leaders whose contributions made this Summit truly exceptional.

As I marked the completion of my two-year Cone Health administrative fellowship last Friday, I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me on this journey.

Over the past two years, I have had the opportunity to work alongside an incredible team, learn from experienced mentors, and take on new responsibilities that have pushed me out of my comfort zone.

But it's not just the skills and knowledge that I've gained that I'm grateful for. It's the people who have made this experience so special. To my colleagues, who have become like a second family to me, thank you for your kindness, guidance, and encouragement. To my mentors, who have taught me so much and believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself, thank you for your wisdom and support. And to ELT, who have given me the freedom to grow and take on new challenges, thank you for your trust and confidence.

This fellowship has been an incredible opportunity for me to develop my skills, build my confidence, and prepare for my next chapter. I am forever grateful for the experience.

That‚Äôs exactly what we do at Brink‚Äôs Inc inc. We are building a culture to be a life long student, we learn everyday, become better everyday and are building the community that is winning together for the common goals.

As the executive sponsor of ASPIRE, Brink‚Äôs Asian American Pacific Islander ERG along with Vinti Gupta as the Chair of ASPIRE, past week we had the great honor to learn from our special guest Anne Chow (She/Her), who as a business leader and a trail blazer is making an impact over three decades at the intersection of people, culture, and technology. Some of her nuggets of wisdom that touched our hearts:

1. #Education is a great equalizer
2. #Be YOUR best everyday
3. Have a deep passion for #Service
4. Every business is a #people business
5. #Leadership is the calling. Leadership is a choice & it transcends.
5. Biggest superpower is #YOU. Be your own authentic self every minute of the day.
6. #Culture is your competitive advantage. It's what in the halls and not what's on the walls.
7. #Lead bigger, lead inclusively. World needs #InclusiveLeadership today!

Thank you Anne Chow for lifting us yet again.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-carmouche-md/,"I re-read Peter Drucker's ""The Effective Executive"". The lessons are timeless. Here are my top 5 takeaways. 

1. Focus on opportunities not problems.

2. Focus on impact (as opposed to effort). 

3. Manage your time. It's our scarcest resource. 

4. Hire for strengths. Everyone has weaknesses.

Half of the world‚Äôs population¬†will experience a mental health disorder¬†in their lifetime‚Äîand yet, the vast majority of those impacted¬†won‚Äôt receive any treatment at all.

What's been most surprising to me is that the responsibility to solve this issue has fallen not on therapists or on the government, but instead, on HR leaders, who have been pressured to understand how employee mental health needs are growing so quickly, while mental health benefit utilization remains shockingly low. 

I'm proud of all the work we've done at Zeera to build a new care model that adequately supports mental health needs, without requiring folks to sit on a waitlist, with tremendous engagement rates.

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheelü•¥. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. üíó
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

I‚Äôm overwhelmed by all the heartfelt messages, phone calls, and kindness from friends and colleagues, as well as the lamenting by patients at the loss of the Walmart Health Care Access Point. I joked with Morgan that I think I‚Äôve heard from everyone I‚Äôve ever met at this point.

Since we announced the closure of Walmart Health, I‚Äôve sat down many times to write my thoughts.

Yesterday, some of my team spent time together in person for likely the last time. Through all the noise, the core message is clear. This is how I will remember Walmart Health: the patients we served, the impact we had in our communities, the vision of what nationally scalable, accessible, and high-quality healthcare could look like, the incredible talent brought to bear, and the lasting friendships.

My goal has always been to make a real difference in at least one person's life each and every day.


To dream the impossible dream
 To fight the unbeatable foe
 To bear with unbearable sorrow
 To run where the brave dare not go
 
 To right the unrightable wrong
 To try when your arms are too weary
 To reach the unreachable star
 
 This is my quest, to follow that star
 No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
 To be willing to march into Hell for a Heavenly cause.
 
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest
 
 And the world will be better for this
 That one man, scorned and covered with scars
 Still strove with his last ounce of courage
 To reach the unreachable star

As a co-founder of SCI Ventures, we‚Äôre on a mission to spark innovation and bridge the gap between lab research and making discoveries available to help restore functions for those with spinal cord injury and ultimately cure paralysis.

At Shepherd Center, we‚Äôre honored to come together with Wings for Life - Spinal Cord Research Foundation, Spinal Research, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, and Promobilia Foundation to support this single, first-of-its-kind, and truly game-changing investment vehicle. Through our combined network and knowledge, we plan to attract more capital to the SCI space by lowering the risk for additional investors from across the VC and healthcare industries. 

Through our combined network and knowledge, we hope to attract more capital, investment, and awareness to develop therapies that will help people begin again after spinal cord injury.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbackus/,"Big news! Today is the launch of SCI Ventures, the first venture philanthropy fund focused on accelerating the development of innovative therapies for people living with paralysis ‚Äì and Shepherd Center is part of it!

As a co-founder of SCI Ventures, we‚Äôre on a mission to spark innovation and bridge the gap between lab research and making discoveries available to help restore functions for those with spinal cord injury and ultimately cure paralysis.

At Shepherd Center, we‚Äôre honored to come together with Wings for Life - Spinal Cord Research Foundation, Spinal Research, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, and Promobilia Foundation to support this single, first-of-its-kind, and truly game-changing investment vehicle. Through our combined network and knowledge, we plan to attract more capital to the SCI space by lowering the risk for additional investors from across the VC and healthcare industries. 

Through our combined network and knowledge, we hope to attract more capital, investment, and awareness to develop therapies that will help people begin again after spinal cord injury.

This past weekend, I officially achieved my goal of pursuing an MBA. Over the past two years, I've expanded my toolkit with new frameworks, perspectives, experiences, friendships, and significant personal and professional growth. This experience exceeded all the expectations I had imagined.

I couldn't have made this possible without the unwavering support of my husband, Dave Russ, MBA, CPA, and my children, Hannah and Michael. I also want to thank my incredible study group, the Lakeshore Legends: Dylan Buckley, Ritu Thomas, Tom Riley, Manoj Arigela, Thomas Zukowski, MD, MBA, and Ram Ananthakrishnan. A big thanks to my family, friends, and the amazing Northwestern University - Kellogg School of Management faculty and staff.

I covered four key points.
 
First ‚Äì¬†Common cases for AI. These include improving the customer experience, better network planning and response to issues, and supporting employees by, for example, generating code.
 
Second ‚Äì¬†Prepare for AI. Create a data strategy and an investment case. Start with pilot projects and ensure seamless integration with existing systems and processes. And most importantly, implement ethical guidelines and monitor AI performance and outcomes.
 
Third ‚Äì¬†Partnerships. Work with hyperscalers to gain access to the latest AI tech, improve cost efficiency, focus on core business functions, and accelerate innovation, all while ensuring robust security and compliance.
 
Fourth ‚Äì¬†Balance the risk of being too early vs too late.¬†Thoroughly evaluate pilot programs, collaborate, and share experiences with partners.
 
Ultimately AI must meet our purpose, which is to connect people securely, safely and with their privacy as a priority.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-leopold-35ba46170/,"When I moved back to my hometown in 2016, I found an RVA that had transformed and grown in so many positive ways. 

Upon my return, one of the first events I attended was a talk by Sports Backers' Executive Director, Jon Lugbill, about the organization‚Äôs progress and impact on the community‚Äîand I was blown away. 

Jon also shared his vision for Sportsbackers. 

He spoke eloquently about the James River ‚Äì and what an asset it is for our community. 

While the accessible, clean river is a key part of the canvas that makes RVA so livable, and in the words of Jon, our ‚Äúawesome active, outdoor river town,‚Äù the people of Sportsbackers help paint it to life. 

Every year, Dominion Energy RiverRock fills the James River and surrounding canal area with leaping dogs, kayaks, concerts, and more than 100,000 smiling faces. 

Each spring, SportsBackers transforms Monument Ave, filling it with runners and its median with meditators, live bands, cheering crowds, and so much more‚Äîfor what I believe is the country‚Äôs fourth-largest 10K. 

They partner with companies like Markel for the #CorporateRun. 
And they fill the holiday season with the CarMax TackyLight Run and whimsy. And more: https://lnkd.in/gXVjXbgS

This spring, it was a pleasure to partner with Megan Schultz and Will Dixon from Sportsbackers‚Äîboth dedicated RVA ‚Äúpainters‚Äù‚Äîto make the inaugural Markel Group Reunion Walk & Run happen. 

Megan and Will are quintessential ‚Äúyes, and‚Ä¶‚Äù people with incredible energy and positivity.

My journey with BlackRock actually started well before I joined the firm.¬†As BlackRock‚Äôs investment banker at Merrill Lynch, I helped BlackRock launch some of its early closed end funds.

These statements were taken randomly from some of my clients‚Äô worksheets, do you recognise yourself in any of them?


ü•∫ Usually, I doubt myself and find out later that I was right at first.


üòü I do care very heavily about what people think about me.


ü§® I want people to know that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs good‚Äù at what he does. I want that reputation.


üòí I worry about the perception from colleagues


üò∞ My procrastination on the task that scares me the most: prepping well for the evaluation session. I am to some extent afraid of being successful, so I don‚Äôt even try.



So, what is that ONE thing?



These days it is conveniently referred to as ‚Äúthe impostor syndrome‚Äù however, it is a combination of several intertwined thought patterns and behaviours that may be difficult to dissect and understand. They could include:

-Depending excessively on external validation

-Self doubt

-Lack of confidence

-Feeling not good enough (or a fraud)

-Fear of failure

-Fear of success

And more‚Ä¶

If you have experienced similar thoughts, moods, emotions that have impacted your performance, your clarity and drive and as a result you are ‚Äúselling yourself short‚Äù or are not being as bold as you‚Äôd like, know that:

‚ú≥Ô∏è Even the most successful, powerful people have these experiences

‚ú≥Ô∏è Consistent work on yourself will pay off ‚Äì understanding your limiting beliefs is a first step!

‚ú≥Ô∏è You can ‚Äúfeel the fear and do it anyway!‚Äù but that‚Äôs so much easier if someone has your back

‚ú≥Ô∏è What other people think of you ‚Äì is none of your business!

‚ú≥Ô∏è What you think of yourself is entirely your business!

‚ú≥Ô∏è Focus on YOU and not on others. Do what you can, with what you‚Äôve got ‚Äì NOW

‚ú≥Ô∏è Love your life and your life will love you back!

And if this is not enough, do talk to me ‚Äì I‚Äôm very high on compassion (according to Jordan Peterson - more than 93 people in a room of 100) and I can also teach you some saboteur-slaying techniques! ü§£ üòú

Approximately eighteen months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, we are witnessing the rapid ascension of artificial intelligence across various sectors. The term ‚ÄúAI‚Äù has become a ubiquitous buzzword in technology, frequently appearing in pitch decks, management meetings, and boardrooms globally. Recent reports indicating that OpenAI is generating approximately $3.4 billion in annual revenue underscore the profound impact and economic potential of this technology.

At Aliya Capital Partners, we are optimistic about the future of AI, though we remain judicious in our investment selections. We believe AI holds transformative potential, heralding a paradigm shift in multiple facets of life and business. The global AI market is projected to grow from $94 billion in 2021 to $998 billion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40%. Major industries, including healthcare, finance, and logistics, are increasingly integrating AI to enhance efficiency and innovation. We are already seeing how AI-driven diagnostics in healthcare are improving patient outcomes, while algorithmic trading in finance is optimizing investment strategies.

I would like to share with you that on May 20, 2024, our beloved dad, Shan K. Thever, passed away.

Our dad was a vibrant personality, energetic professional and dedicated husband, father and grandfather. He was an inspiration in so many ways and to so many people. 

He came to this country with only a few hundred dollars in his pocket. Through his determination, hard work and tenacity, he successfully completed his undergraduate education at UCLA and received his JD from UCLA School of Law. 

Our dad went on to establish and lead a successful law practice for decades. He was a trailblazer and a pioneer both in and out of the courtroom. He was courageous, took risks and overcame numerous obstacles, and was a preeminent attorney, successfully arguing cases in front of the California Supreme Court. He served as the Director of the Small Law Firm Center at the New York City Bar Association and for the past five years he served as the Deputy County Council for Los Angeles County as a member of the Ethics, Transparency and Legislative Affairs team.

Our dad was a colleague, friend and confidant of Governors, County Supervisors, Council Members and so many others. In addition to numerous awards and appointments, he received the inaugural Trailblazer Award from the South Asian Bar Association and was recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives, receiving a U.S. Congressional Commendation for being an inspiring leader in the South Asian community and a true advocate for political change among the Asian population.

He was an inspiration not only for the professional success he achieved, but also for the way he lived his life. He believed in living a productive and meaningful life, in helping others, in lifting his community and in creating greater opportunity for his children than he had himself. He instilled in us a deep responsibility to, in turn, create greater opportunity for our children and generations to come. He also instilled in us the importance of public service and of being contributing members of society and having a meaningful impact on the world.

In his personal time he loved to be with his family celebrating holidays, cooking together, and discussing politics and current events over a bottle of Cabernet. 

He loved his grandchildren more than anything and was so very proud to see the young people they are and the success they continue to achieve. He was happy to see the wealth of opportunity in front of them. 

While he may not be here in physical form, our dad is always with us. He lived a successful, productive and impactful life, and this world is a better place because of him.

We ask that if you have any special anecdotes, stories or memories about our dad to please share with us via private message.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-mcneely-9060b8206/,MISC,,Image,Douglas,McNeely,The Carlyle Group,Private Equity,Managing Director,2024-07-02 16:16,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209246271130210304,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQES03wPBTb65Q/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718739078524?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=kwKxo88ddNzLHqySa9bEgpIhsfR1naydmhBbCYbaN9c,,,,,144,31,0,2w,,,,Douglas McNeely supports this,Reaction,,2024-06-19 13:30,,,,,,,,,Wednesday,5:30 PM,6/19/2024,Wednesday,,Engagement,5-6pm,,,,,,175,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We've all been there ‚Äì you accept a LinkedIn connection request, and BAM! Immediate sales pitch. This needs to end. Imagine meeting someone on the street, them saying ""nice to meet you,"" and then instantly asking you for money or some crazy trade. You would think they are nuts.

Here's a better approach (and there are about 1000 better than the one above): leverage the accepted connection to gain insights and develop a genuine relationship. Learn what's important to them. Comment on their posts, share insights they may find valuable, and build trust and credibility through those actions.

When the time is right, send a message that aligns with what you've learned. Provide a thoughtful, Doug Landis-patented hypothesis that demonstrates you understand their business (and needs). No sales pitch is necessary in that message either!

Don't want to be treated like a spam account? Then stop acting like one.

And if you put the sales pitch in the connection request, that's an automatic decline for me.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,MISC,,Image,Drew,Bernstein,LLR Partners,Private Equity,"Director, Revenue Operations",2024-07-02 16:09,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207387854388277249,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQFXscGX0MrIpg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718375169788?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=44JUNjtBDSDJn4VOd2ppTnkUF6eeiMT92HawmDOv-YM,,,,,53,7,0,2w,,,,Post,Post,,2024-06-14 10:26,,,,,,,,,Friday,2:26 PM,6/14/2024,Friday,,Post,2-3pm,,,,,,60,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(1) Go talk to 10 customers. Ask them what they were most curious about +  most worried about while they were thinking about buying your thing. Ask them what they were doing before you showed up. Ask them about the moment they knew they needed something better. Ask them when they knew you were the right choice for them. Take notes. Record the convos if you can. Buy them coffee or lunch or donate to a charity on their behalf as a thank you. Follow up with your team re: any lingering support or product issues they bring up. Close the loop. 

(2) Go talk to every single one of your sales reps. Ask them where the dead spots are in your sales pitch and product demo, what the most helpful pieces of marketing content are, and what else is on their wish-list. Ask them what's getting in their way. Ask them what they need to win one more 50/50 deal this year. Listen. 

I promise you after these conversations (which should take you about two weeks to finish), you will have more ideas than you know what to do with. It‚Äôll be shockingly easy to build yourself a plan for the next 6 months, sourced directly from your two most important customers: 

The people who buy your stuff, and the people who sell it.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,"Most B2B companies are still running their content strategy like it's 2012. Pushing whitepapers and webinars to drive MQLs is outdated, ineffective, and way too expensive. Here's why:

Metadata published a report analyzing $37M ad spend on lead gen campaigns.

The result: only 0.2%(!) of MQLs converted to closed-won deals. 

That means you need 500 leads to acquire a new customer‚Äîwhich is painfully inefficient given the average cost per lead of $123.

The driving force behind this is the significant shift in buyer behavior:

1. Buyers now prefer to educate themselves at their own pace, diving deep into content to find solutions to their challenges (without giving up their email address or phone number in a lead form).

2. The buying journey has become more dynamic and unpredictable, with dark social channels playing a crucial role in how buyers gather information.

3. Buying committees have nearly tripled in size over the past decade, leading to longer sales cycles and a greater need for multiple touchpoints.

_____

Your content strategy needs to reflect these changes. Here's how:

‚úÖ Conduct interviews with your 10 best customers and analyze 20 recent sales call recordings to identify pain points and objections.

‚úÖ Develop content pillars and topics that revolve around these pain points and objections.

‚úÖ Identify 3-5 internal subject matter experts (SMEs) who are comfortable on camera and willing to build their LinkedIn presence. Preferably include 1-2 people from the executive team.

‚úÖ Conduct bi-weekly interviews with each SME. Turn each interview recording into 1 long-form article, 4+ video clips and 10+ LinkedIn posts.

‚úÖ Publish this content on the personal LinkedIn profiles of your SMEs (3-5x per week). Publish the article and video clips on the website, repurpose the interview recording for YouTube and create a weekly newsletter with the best insights from the interviews.

‚úÖ After 2 months, start running LinkedIn Thought Leader Ads* to promote the top-performing LinkedIn posts to your target accounts.

*Paid social should mainly be used for content distribution, not lead generation. Would you rather pay $150 for 100 decision makers to read your case study, or $150 for just one person to maybe read your whitepaper?

‚úÖ Roll out an employee advocacy program to turn the rest of your employees into an organic marketing channel.

(1) Go talk to 10 customers. Ask them what they were most curious about +  most worried about while they were thinking about buying your thing. Ask them what they were doing before you showed up. Ask them about the moment they knew they needed something better. Ask them when they knew you were the right choice for them. Take notes. Record the convos if you can. Buy them coffee or lunch or donate to a charity on their behalf as a thank you. Follow up with your team re: any lingering support or product issues they bring up. Close the loop. 

(2) Go talk to every single one of your sales reps. Ask them where the dead spots are in your sales pitch and product demo, what the most helpful pieces of marketing content are, and what else is on their wish-list. Ask them what's getting in their way. Ask them what they need to win one more 50/50 deal this year. Listen. 

I promise you after these conversations (which should take you about two weeks to finish), you will have more ideas than you know what to do with. It‚Äôll be shockingly easy to build yourself a plan for the next 6 months, sourced directly from your two most important customers: 

The people who buy your stuff, and the people who sell it. 

So get out of the spreadsheet, and get into the field.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bernstein-0605a01b/,"Fewer than 25% of sales organizations have a forecast accuracy of 75% or greater according to Korn Ferry.

As an example, Salesforce missed its revenue forecast for the first time in 20 years two weeks ago, causing a 20% drop in stock ($40+ billion in market cap - since then recovered to -12.77%).

The ripple effects can be huge:
-  Stressful board meetings
-  Drop in equity value
-  Re-forecast
-  Sales capacity wrong
-  Re-structuring

No question - accurate forecasting is hard.

As a SaaS scale-up, you don't need to forecast +/-2% before the quarter starts like Salesforce.

Actually, you shouldn't - way too much time would be lost trying to perfect the forecast process.

BUT, you should aim get to > 90% by week 4.

Forecasting isn't about the final number - it's a process that should help you beat the outcome in a predictable way.

Here are 3 simply tips to improve your forecasting process:

1.  Run a forecast process
-  Most SaaS companies run a weekly rhythm
-  Clean pipeline data is paramount
-  1-1s, pipeline reviews, and forecasting meetings
-  Track weekly changes

2.  Forecast new logo + expansions + renewals separately
-  Forecast your pipeline for new logo, expansions and renewals
-  Adjust stages, and forecast categories to mirror you new logo, expansion, and -  renewal process

3.  Combine forecasts
-  Weighted, bottom-up, Ops or/and AI prediction to have different input factors
-  Tweak the weighted and ops model to increase accuracy
-  Track forecast accuracy of bottom up forecast

Founded by my grandfather and now led by my father, Dan Bernstein as CEO, Bel Fuse stands as a testament to enduring success and unwavering commitment to core values.

Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the dedication, resilience, and integrity that fueled the family business. Here are some fundamental principles that have been passed down through generations, shaping not only Bel's journey but also my approach as an Operating Partner in the private equity space:

- Respecting the Team: Bel has always believed in treating employees like family. This deep respect for the team has fostered a culture of loyalty, collaboration, and mutual growth. It's a principle I hold dear, knowing that a company's true strength lies in its people. 

- Running the Business the Right Way: Integrity has always been at the heart of Bel Fuse. My grandfather's mantra of doing business the right way‚Äîfairly, ethically, and transparently‚Äîhas been a cornerstone of success. This ethos guides my interactions and decisions as I work with founders to build sustainable and ethical businesses.

- Balancing Conservatism with Aggression: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the art of balancing conservative strategies with calculated risks. My father has and continues to excel at identifying moments to be bold while maintaining a prudent approach. This balance is crucial in driving growth without compromising stability.

- Consistent Leadership and Values: The importance of consistent leadership and adherence to core values cannot be overstated. At Bel Fuse, leadership is not just about steering the company but embodying the values that have been their foundation. I strive to bring this consistency to portcos I partner with, ensuring that the companies I support stay true to their roots while evolving for future success.

As I reflect on these invaluable lessons, I am filled with pride and gratitude. They have not only shaped Bel Fuse's legacy but also equipped me to support other founders on their journeys. In my current role, I leverage these insights to help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and build businesses that stand the test of time.

Here's to 75 years of Bel Fuse‚Äîand to many more years of leadership, integrity, and success!

Yup.

We've improved the time to install, implement, and backfill all your Salesforce Campaign data with Align.ly Attribution from several hours to just 5 minutes.

I've now personally done over 100 implementations of Align.ly Attribution and we've obsessed over removing every friction point in the implementation process.

In addition to a 5 minute implementation and backfilling all your data so you get immediate insights, we also offer a free trial. Compare that to a world where our competitors take 6-8 weeks to implement, simply say ""trust us"", and charge 10x the price.

Last week, I had the opportunity to discuss how in Public Storage we are leveraging SAP to drive innovation and transform our business operations. By integrating SAP, we are equipped to scale effectively, enhance our data-driven decision-making, accelerate month-end closures, and harness the power of AI.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,"From Senior Prom to Senior (Young!) Citizens: A 53-Year Love Story

As we mark Loving Day today, June 12th, I am reminded of the enduring power of love and resilience.¬†In November 1971, a few years after the landmark Loving v. Virginia decision, considered one of the most significant legal decisions of the¬†civil rights era, a senior boy asked a junior girl on a date (my/our first date). We attended a concert by Motown‚Äôs one and only Temptations (the original singers, I might add!), which turned tempting parents on their heels. We were high school students at a Catholic school, and our decision to go on a date was met with significant backlash. The school administration and several parents expressed dissatisfaction, calling the school to voice their disapproval. Yet, amidst the uproar, my parents, originally from Alabama, and his parents, from Montana, stood by us.

Some civil rights history: In 1958, Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Loving, a Black woman, were married in Washington, D.C., where interracial marriage was legal. Upon their return to Virginia, they were arrested and charged with violating the state's anti-miscegenation laws, specifically the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. This law prohibited marriages between white and non-white individuals, reflecting the entrenched racial segregation of the time.
The Lovings‚Äîhow fitting that their last name was Loving‚Äîwere sentenced to one year in prison, with the sentence suspended on the condition that they leave Virginia for 25 years.

Unwilling to accept this injustice, they challenged the conviction, leading to a Supreme Court ruling on June 12, 1967. The Court unanimously declared Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, stating that such laws violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Earl Warren asserted, ""The freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State."" Reflecting on this historic decision, it's sobering to consider how today's Supreme Court might view such a ruling.

Note: It wasn't until 2000 that Alabama officially removed its anti-miscegenation law from the books through a public referendum, underscoring the deep-rooted racism and resistance to interracial marriages even decades after the Loving decision.

Our journey from that first date in 1971 to celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary this summer is a testament to us and to the progress and challenges that remain in society. We have been together for almost 53 years, dating nearly eight years before getting married. We continue to witness the good, bad, and ugly societal attitudes toward #interracial and same-sex relationships.

We hope that by sharing our journey, we can educate and inspire others about the importance of love, equality, and the ongoing fight against #discrimination in the broader struggle for marriage equality for everyone.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,MISC,,Image,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",2024-07-01 16:02,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208666309209796608,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQGShOaf8CMfXg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718219595795?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=OTSozSMorJSBlB-RkJdo8cV5cK5BDJnXbNXgiD-HxrI,,,,,10750,570,148,2w,,,,Fariha Greenwood likes this,Likes,,2024-06-18 03:06,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,7:06 AM,6/18/2024,Tuesday,,Engagement,7-8am,,,,,,11468,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,"After a three-month hiatus, former Goldman Sachs executive Beth Hammack has landed her next gig as CEO and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

Hammack's departure from Goldman in February was just the latest sign that the glass ceiling at the investment bank is still impenetrable. Despite its pledges to diversify its management ranks, Goldman has never had a female chair, CEO, president or CFO.

I wrote for Bloomberg Opinion at the time that we don‚Äôt know exactly why Hammack decided to leave, but we have plenty of clues. The company passed her over as CFO in 2021, instead moving Hammack into a position it claimed would eventually lead to a more senior role. (Spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt.) And that‚Äôs despite being described by colleagues and industry insiders as a ‚Äúunique talent who dedicated her life to the firm,‚Äù a ‚Äúdeep intellect‚Äù and ‚Äúbound for higher office.‚Äù

She was said to have lacked ‚Äúthe swagger‚Äù of Goldman‚Äôs high-fliers and kept her ‚Äúties to a number of illustrious industry figures under close wrap,"" encapsulating the lose-lose position in which women at Hammack‚Äôs level frequently find themselves. Too little swagger and she‚Äôs considered ‚Äúatypical‚Äù for Goldman; too much and¬†research¬†suggests she would risk being marked as overly ambitious.

The most striking and cringe-worthy anecdote I read about Hammack came from a former Goldman executive who told Bloomberg News in 2020: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs brilliant and she can explain the most complicated things in standard English. Once I thought of challenging her and asked if she could explain something in a Haiku.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a metaphor there ‚Äî the impossible standards women at the top are held to, the extra mile they are asked to go, how little their time is valued. And no surprise, Hammack delivered the haiku first thing the next morning. So why did she leave? Maybe she just got tired jumping through all those hoops and never landing at the top.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,MISC,,Article,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",2024-07-01 16:02,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7205145619248623617,,,,,,619,42,21,1mo,,,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-23/shake-ups-at-goldman-sachs-and-boeing-show-glass-ceiling-remains?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=linkedin,Fariha Greenwood likes this,Likes,,2024-06-08 09:56,,,,,,,,,Saturday,1:56 PM,6/8/2024,Saturday,,Engagement,1-2pm,,,,,,682,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,"So about six weeks ago, we decided to launch Joseph‚Äôs Challenge - No Limits. The intention was to raise ¬£100k and the challenge is for Joseph, who has Down Syndrome, to try and run 10x10ks in 10 countries in 5 days at the end of August starting from a running base of zero.

If you want to support him please donate at
 https://gofund.me/5cc8d709 and if you want to follow Joseph‚Äôs progress, please follow him at https://lnkd.in/eUVjyueH.

The fundraising has gone so well that,including pledges, we are very nearly at our initial target of ¬£100k and are now in the process of launching plans to create a social enterprise to support adults with special needs with training and employment opportunities in addition to hiring a disability sports officer. Massive thanks to all who have donated so far.

It‚Äôs been a big week this week with Joseph recovering from a knee injury, appearing on BBC and being a guest of the wonderful Chair of the FA, Debbie Hewitt in the Royal Box at Wembley receiving a signed Harry Kane shirt in recognition of his fundraising efforts so far. Joseph says he is more famous than his three sisters now‚Ä¶.

We are also able to announce our first official partner, the wonderful Travelcounsellors, who are going to help manage the logistics of getting to 10 countries in 5 days with one or two jogs in between !!

We chose the title No Limits for this fundraising because when Joseph was born he spent three weeks in special care, didn‚Äôt walk until he was nearly three and everything we were told and read was about the limitations of a child with DS.

Lessons learned so far :

1) I am not very good on Instagram (I am managing Joseph‚Äôs Challenge account) - my youngest daughter tells me it‚Äôs sad to be following more people than follow you so please help me by following Joseph‚Äôs Challenge
2) I love the fact I am at an age where I don‚Äôt care about 1) !!!
3) Some people think it‚Äôs wrong to put someone like Joseph through a challenge like this - all I say to them is if you want to take him on at butterfly go for it !!!!
4) Most people are incredibly kind and go out of their way to support you when you put yourself out there
5) I am still afraid of failure and won‚Äôt relax until we have a social enterprise up and running
6) Joseph has taught us that if you go for 1% improvements and don‚Äôt cap your expectations or focus on a single target, you can really surprise yourself
7) Dont be afraid to ask so please donate !!!!
8) I have no idea how hashtags work but here goes ! #josephschallenge #travelcounsellors #nolimits #disabilitysports",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fariha-greenwood/,MISC,,Image,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",2024-07-01 16:02,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7205384099362914304,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQG5QLI3MV1lDA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1717844439921?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=wkJ1QoJ-2xXhdVTdFrU0lKhYiPCxDKlz-a1O1B2Nvcs,,,,,283,46,16,3w,,,,Fariha Greenwood likes this,Likes,,2024-06-09 01:43,,,,,,,,,Sunday,5:43 AM,6/9/2024,Sunday,,Engagement,5-6am,,,,,,345,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It came out 5 years before I was born. There are six career options for women; a ballerina, model, actress, flight attendant, nurse and teacher. At the time this board game came out, it was very progressive because women weren‚Äôt encouraged to work at all. THIS WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO!!! Let this reminder be what fuels you to dream big, take risks, be bold, disrupt industries, invent, redefine the conventional image and definition of success, and never let fear hold you back from trying new things or from becoming the best version of yourself. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Think of all the women who came before us that never got the chance. Every day I wake up with gratitude for more options, and deeply appreciate the women and men who came before me who spoke up, showed up, and pushed society to allow women to be deemed worthy enough to vote, worthy enough to get a business loan, and ultimately decide what they want to become. ‚Å£

AI is about to massively disrupt every industry. The real opportunity lies not in LLMs, which will be commoditized and dominated by big tech, but in startups focused on vertical applications of AI.

Jurny exemplifies this perfectly. In my opinion, they are the best-positioned company to disrupt the $4.7 trillion hospitality industry, which is riddled with inefficiencies.

Their traction is off the charts üìà, and for a limited time, they are opening investment to customers and retail investors alongside top-tier venture capitalists. If you are considering an investment in AI, you won‚Äôt want to miss this chance. https://lnkd.in/gXNv8PYm

Check out Ed Sheeran‚Äôs first song:

I love this video because it shows that someone who is considered incredibly talented NOW was absolutely awful early.

He got good by practicing incredibly hard - not just because of natural abilities.

Most of the great joys in my life are on the other side of being horrible at them early. Being an entrepreneur. Writing online. Helping CEOs solve problems.

Question:

What are you resisting doing more of that you really enjoy - but that you are awful at today?

- Upgrading all subscribers to a new micro-services tech platform (that engages more people with wellbeing and increases check-ins)
- Investing in digital partnerships to complement the amazing offering we have with in person fitness and wellness partners!

And now, changing the name of the entire business to Wellhub. An obvious decision considering a multi-year perspective.

Got my welcome to Wellhub kit today!

It's day 1.

I'm feeling fresh to takle our mission to make every company a wellness company and help employees check-in with their wellbeing everyday.

*WE* design it and *WE* build it.

I can imagine thousands of scenarios where a turbojet goes terribly wrong.
Yet we managed to make turbojets insanely reliable before deploying them widely.

The question is similar for AI:
 ""do we think there exists at least one design of an AI system that is simultaneously safe/controllable, and can fulfill objectives in more intelligent ways than humans ?""
If the answer is yes, we'll be fine.
If the answer is no, we won't build it.
Right now, we don't even have a hint of a design of a human-level intelligent system.

So it's too early to worry about it.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fgpadilha/,"Une Coupe de Cheveux en Provence (with help from GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

In days past, a classic consulting firm interview question involved quantitative estimation, such as asking how many gas stations there are in New York.

I decided to test the quantitative reasoning skills of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with a similar question: ‚ÄúWhat is the size of a town in Provence that might support 2-3 barbers or hair salons?‚Äù

GPT-4o reasoned that a barber shop or salon might handle 15 clients a day, 5 days a week, and that potential clients might get a haircut every two months, resulting in an estimate of 600 clients per shop, and 1,200 to 1,800 clients for 2-3 shops.

GPT-4o: ‚ÄúFor instance, a town like Crestet, which has a population of around 400 (as of recent estimates), would likely not support 2-3 salons on its own, but nearby larger towns might.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven Crestet's small size, you might look for nearby towns such as:

Vaison-la-Romaine: A larger town approximately 15 minutes away, with a population of around 6,000 people, which likely supports multiple barbers and hair salons.

Carpentras: About 30 minutes away, with a population of around 30,000, offering many more options.

Final Recommendation:

For a reliable haircut experience, consider driving to Vaison-la-Romaine or Carpentras, where you will find several barbers and hair salons catering to a larger population. This ensures you have multiple options to choose from.‚Äù

Finally, it produced the image below.


Claude 3.5 Sonnet asserted that ‚Äú[a] typical hair salon can serve about 100-200 regular clients‚Äù and assumed that ‚Äúpeople get haircuts every 6-8 weeks on average.‚Äù

Using the midpoints of those ranges, it got to 3,375 people to support 2-3 shops.  It then noted that in ‚Äúmore rural areas like Provence, people might travel further for services.  We should add a buffer to account for this: let's say 20%.

3,375 * 1.2 = 4,050 people‚Äù

Finally, it rounded up for a conservative estimate:  ‚ÄúTo ensure the town can comfortably support 2-3 salons, let's round up.

A town of about 4,500-5,000 people should be able to support 2-3 barbers or hair salons in a rural French setting like Provence.‚Äù

It did an excellent job of identifying 5 nearby towns as options, based on population and driving distance, and concluded:

‚ÄúAmong these options, Vaison-la-Romaine is likely your best bet, given its proximity and adequate size to support multiple hair salons. Orange and Carpentras, while slightly farther, offer more options due to their larger populations. Nyons is a good middle-ground option, while Buis-les-Baronnies might be worth checking if you prefer a smaller town setting.‚Äù


My assessment: GPT-4o did a better job on the estimation portion of the problem and on the image, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet came up with a nice set of towns.  Based on these analyses, I am heading to Vaison-la-Romaine and will report back in the comments.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulerio/,"""Hi Miguel, welcome to day 7. Here are relevant training options based on your onboarding questionnaire.""

New in Microsoft Copilot Studio: create copilots that act as agents üöÄ

Copilot agents orchestrate complex business processes. They act as independent agents working for you to look up information, reason over data, and use generative AI to kick off the appropriate chain of actions in response.

For example, an employee onboarding copilot:
- üì§ Gets trigged from a new hire event
- üëã Sends introduction message with personalized onboarding plan
-  üìä Reasons over data to answer employee questions
- üìö Recommends personalized training based on employee background

The underlaying capabilities that make it all possible:
- ùó¢ùóøùó∞ùóµùó≤ùòÄùòÅùóøùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùóºùó≥ ùó∞ùóºùó∫ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÖ ùòÅùóÆùòÄùó∏ùòÄ. Use generative AI to plan and reason to manage complex, multistep tasks.
- ùó†ùó≤ùó∫ùóºùóøùòÜ ùóÆùóªùó± ùó∞ùóºùóªùòÅùó≤ùòÖùòÅ. One frustrating thing about support is having to repeat yourself many times. Copilots learn from previous history to personalize interactions, so you don't need to repeat yourself every single time.
- ùó†ùóºùóªùó∂ùòÅùóºùóøùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóÆùóªùó± ùó∂ùó∫ùóΩùóøùóºùòÉùó∂ùóªùó¥.¬†Copilots can learn and adapt, providing a comprehensive history of its activities. You can see what actions and decisions it made -- and correct and teach them with just a few clicks.
- ùóóùó≤ùóπùó≤ùó¥ùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµ ùó∞ùóºùóªùó≥ùó∂ùó±ùó≤ùóªùó∞ùó≤ ùóÆùóªùó± ùó¥ùòÇùóÆùóøùó±ùóøùóÆùó∂ùóπùòÄ. Copilots operate strictly within the defined instruction, knowledge, and actions, and maintain stringent security measures and controls.

When can I use it?
- These new capabilities are currently accessible to customers participating in a limited private preview.
- Organizations such as Centro de la Familia are exploring agent capabilities that support teachers and case workers, allowing them to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time working with children, ultimately leading to better child outcomes.

Given the 240-year history of the Bank of New York, we are fascinated by the perseverance that has defined our company.

Let this history inspire us to apply excellent engineering principles to all we do. Remember that quality is a habit more so than a performance. We work at it not occasionally but always, tenaciously, and resiliently.

Imbedding quality into what we do is a marathon, not a sprint.
Above all, one needs resilience. It also demands for patience. Accept the challenges, learn from our mistakes, and never give up on improving moving forward.

Best assets of BNY are its #people and its #resilience. Collaborating, we can protect BNY tradition and encourage originality and excellence in whatever we do.

To 240 more robust years to come! Happy Founders Day! #1784 #1869

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulerio/,"I am deeply pleased to share that I have graduated from the ITSMF - Information Technology Senior Management Forum Management Academy. My profound gratitude goes to Bank of America for the unwavering investment in my professional development. This support not only enhances my capabilities but also inspires me to contribute more meaningfully each day to my teammates and the community in which we live and work.

The ITSMF Management Academy offers Black IT leaders a truly transformative journey. Over the past ten months, alongside my 76 cohort members‚Äîaffectionately known as the Phoenix 76‚Äîwe embarked on an intense and immersive experience that underscored ITSMF's mission to transform the mind, body, and soul. Through 26 assignments, over ten book readings, executive and book presentations, leader-to-leader sessions, and monthly cohort calls, our directors, Dr Turner and Shakeer Abdullah, Ph.D. challenged us to lead ourselves first before leading others. Their dedication delivered a leadership program that was both rigorous and methodical, transforming us from the inside out. One particularly impactful aspect was the unfiltered feedback, which was both constructive and compassionate.

To cap it off, I was humbled to receive the ITSMF Global Citizenship Award. This honor fuels my resolve and inspires me to continue showing up selflessly for those around me.

I would like to honor a few individuals who made this experience unforgettable:

‚Ä¢ My leader, Terrelle Carswell has been my staunch advocate throughout this journey. His support, advocacy, and encouragement have been invaluable.

‚Ä¢ My accountability partner in the program, Zena Kyles, MBA, PMP, epitomizes strength and resolve. She taught me to put aside excuses and simply show up.

‚Ä¢ My executive mentor, Tonya Bryant, challenged me to aim high. Her encouragement to continually pursue growth and learning was invaluable.

To my Phoenix 76 family: Our ten-month metamorphosis required us to trust the process. We finished strong because we learned to humbly sharpen each other to excel and thrive.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikodakalla/,"""At the World Championships in Budapest in June, USA‚Äôs Anita Alvarez sank to the bottom of the pool.

Looking across the deck, then noticing she was under way too long, her coach, Andrea Fuentes immediately dove in after her fully clothed, pulling her to safety. Anita was unconscious and didn‚Äôt have the capacity to kick, paddle, or help herself in any way.

If Andrea had not have noticed, she would have drown.

But she knew Anita.
She looked for her, quickly noticed she was under too long, (nore than normal)
then dove in without thinking twice.

This has resonated with me‚Ä¶.

When you are under too long, who are the people that will look for you, notice you aren't surfacing, and dive in to pull you to the surface when you lose your strength to swim in life?

Who are the people that would do that for you?

And can someone count on you to be that person that would go looking and notice when they are under too long, diving in to support them when they are all out of fight and fuel to swim in these turbulent waters we call life?

https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikodakalla/,"20 yr Workiversary

Thanks to the many friends, colleagues, and clients who congratulated me over the last week regarding my 20th anniversary with Frost Bank. It‚Äôs been a great ride, and I‚Äôve no intentions of getting off any time soon.

Milestones are funny things though. I realized, for example, that I‚Äôve now worked at one place longer than I lived in my hometown of Knippa! Or, that the city I moved to (MSA of ~ 1 million in 2004), having just been ranked the fastest growing MSA in the country for a staggering 12th consecutive year, is no longer a mid sized college town, but now a burgeoning internationally recognized City of 2.4 million - with all the perks and challenges that come with that kind of growth. Or that the company I joined would evolve into a top 50 bank in the US with nearly 200 branches and industry leading people and products (see #1 in customer satisfaction JD Power rankings,  or best mortgage lender in Texas by CNN).

And when I think back on the kid I was back then, I realize just how fortunate (blessed) I‚Äôve been these past two decades to have people in my life who‚Äôve gone out of their way to help mentor and guide me along the way. While too many to thank individually, there are a few I do have to call out specifically. Ronnie Miksch, Tim Crowley, Will Ingram, Keith Donahoe, John Schawe, John Greenwood, Ken Gates -  Your kindness, direction, and coaching (yes Ro, I‚Äôm talking to you) made me the banker I am today. I‚Äôve still got lots to learn, but I owe each of you a great deal for your help along the way.

I want to close with the thought I shared with the team last Friday morning as we celebrated with some chicken minis (cause everyone loves those things!). And that is, I‚Äôm more optimistic today about the future here at Frost than I‚Äôve ever been. It feels like Frost, and specifically the Austin team, is having our moment in the spotlight, as we hire up and grow across the region. I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of the people I get to do that with, and if you need a good bank to help you, or your company, give me a call, I genuinely would love to help.

Cheers y‚Äôall.

Karla was an incredible wife and mother to our two sons, Collin Johnson and Connor Johnson. During our 32 years of marriage, I witnessed her love and generosity touch everyone she met.

Karla devoted her life to helping others and had a particular passion for pets, especially German Shepherds. Her commitment to education and pet shelters was a testament to her generous spirit. Karla was not only the family planner and holiday host but also a loving sister and daughter who brought joy and love to every moment.

Many have asked about how to honor her memory. In lieu of flowers, Karla would have preferred donations to her scholarship fund. This non-profit ensures that 100% of the contributions go directly to deserving scholarship recipients.

This transition has been a time for me to reflect on my journey and be grateful for the opportunities and relationships I have had on my way!

The camaraderie I've received from my colleagues has been instrumental in my professional and personal development. Together, we have navigated challenges, celebrated successes, and continually strived to provide the highest quality of care to our patients. 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to every team member, colleague and friend I've had the privilege of working with. Your collaboration, and encouragement have made me a better clinician, leader and person.

As I embark on this new chapter, I carry with me the lessons learned and the friendships formed at St Joseph Medical Center and VMFH. While leaving is bittersweet, I am excited for what the future holds and confident that the foundation built here will continue to support my growth.

I look forward to staying connected and cheering on your continued success from afar.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesnewsom/,"Since our founding in 2012, the security of our customers‚Äô data has been our highest priority. That‚Äôs why the recent cyber security threat targeting some of our customers has been unsettling, especially given that we, and cybersecurity experts Mandiant (part of Google Cloud) and CrowdStrike, have found no evidence to suggest that unauthorized access to Snowflake customer accounts stemmed from a breach of Snowflake's enterprise environment.

Mandiant released their investigative report on the threat on June 10th confirming our preliminary findings that we had begun sharing with our customers on May 24th.

Key Mandiant findings include:

‚ñ™ Every incident Mandiant responded to associated with this campaign was traced back to compromised customer credentials.
‚ñ™ The impacted accounts were not configured with multi-factor authentication enabled, meaning successful authentication only required a valid username and password.
‚ñ™ Credentials identified in infostealer malware output were still valid, in some cases years after they were stolen, and had not been rotated or updated.
‚ñ™ The impacted Snowflake customer instances did not have network allow lists in place to only allow access from trusted locations.

We operate under a shared responsibility security model with our customers ‚Äì with them having the responsibility to follow best practices when configuring networks and enforcing secure authentication methods for access to their systems ‚Äì and now we plan to strengthen this model by requiring more stringent protections.

In the coming weeks, we will be providing a feature for administrators of Snowflake accounts to make multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for all users; ultimately moving to MFA by default. While we target to roll out the enhanced authentication policies by the end of June, we are going to do this in a controlled and staged way alongside close communication and enablement. By doing so, we‚Äôll not only be helping our customers better protect themselves, but we‚Äôll also be leading the industry to what we believe will become an industry standard.

We are also accelerating in-product capabilities, such as our Trust Center. This new active audit and monitoring capability is expected to be generally available by the end of June, with additional transparency specifically around MFA and network policies.

This is in addition to other actions we‚Äôve already taken, like locking customer accounts where we saw cyber threat activity, working closely with affected customers to help them better protect themselves, and communicating with all of our customers to harden their security measures.

You have our commitment that the security of your data will always be our highest priority.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesnewsom/,Customer Centricity,post,Text,James ,Newsom Jr.,Jaccuzi,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Senior Director, Data Services",2024-07-01 16:43,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208584940999905281,,,,,,3429,156,396,1w,,,,James Newsom Jr liked Ofir Nir‚Äôs comment on this,Liked a comment,,2024-06-17 21:42,,,,,,,,,Tuesday,1:42 AM,6/18/2024,Tuesday,,Engagement,1-2am,,,,,,3981,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonwarner3/,"Thrilled to share that I am now cancer-free and on a slow and steady road to recovery. üíú üí™ 

A few months ago, a preventative MRI revealed a rare tumor on my pancreas (solid pseudopapillary neoplasm). Thanks to early detection, we acted quickly before it spread, removing just 25% of my pancreas while largely preserving my spleen and other vital organs.  The tests are back, and the cancer is gone.

Key learnings from this journey:

üîπ Proactive Health: Early detection can save lives, and in my case, it did. My cancer was found through a preventative MRI. I had no signs or symptoms of cancer, in fact I was the healthiest I'd been in years.
üîπSelf-Advocacy: If you're unsatisfied with your healthcare provider, seek a second opinion at another institution.  Advocate for yourself, even when it feels deeply uncomfortable.
üîπ¬†Empathy: You never know what someone is going through. Be kind and supportive, as they may be putting on a brave face. 
üîπ Gratitude: Immense thanks to Biograph's diligent team for the early detection, my employer and team at OpenAI for their unwavering support, my all star husband Connor O'Brien, and our friends, family, and community for standing by our family through this. Special thanks to the world-class team at Stanford University for their exceptional care through every step of my journey. Truly the best healthcare institution in the world.

Looking forward, I'm increasingly optimistic about the future of healthcare, especially with AI's potential. Numerous promising AI companies in healthcare are emerging, and I'm excited to support their growth through any way possible. I believe that AI will revolutionize healthcare, making early detection and effective treatment more accessible.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement. This experience has strengthened my resolve to live fully and prioritize health, wellness, and family. üíú",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonwarner3/,MISC,,Text,Jason,Warner,Francisco Partners,Private Equity,"Managing Director, Data Science",2024-07-02 15:24,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211146093244370945,,,,,,6438,251,3,1w,,,,"Jason Warner, CFA likes this",Likes,,2024-06-24 19:20,,,,,,,,,Monday,11:20 PM,6/24/2024,Monday,,Engagement,11-12am,,,,,,6692,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonchapman/,"Today Entergy Texas submitted its proposal to build Legend and Lone Star Power Stations - two¬†natural gas¬†power plants¬†in Jefferson and Liberty counties. These 24/7 dispatchable resources will address the critical need for increased power generation capacity, support increased economic activity throughout the region, and pave the way for sustainable energy solutions that will benefit #SETX for decades to come.

These future-forward projects are projected to save customers approximately $370 million over the lifespan of the plants. These power stations are expected to be in service in 2028 and will bring a total of $2.8 billion in economic benefits to the region.¬†Approval of the two facilities by the Public Utility Commission of Texas will increase service reliability for all customers and support large-scale economic activity in the region like Sempra Infrastructure‚Äôs Port Arthur LNG facility.¬†The design of these plants will also enable carbon capture and hydrogen co-firing technology.

Today's filing is a critical step forward for our recently announced Southeast Texas Energy Plan, also known as #STEPahead. The strategic plan aims to add additional generation capacity to the power grid by 2028, critical transmission to get power where it‚Äôs needed, and grid-hardening projects to help Southeast Texas withstand extreme weather.

I recently heard someone on a podcast about our industry say that the next generation of aspiring trailer editors needed only to hear from the young editors now working in the trailer companies because they really couldn‚Äôt relate to the editors who were cutting trailers in the 80‚Äôs.
This actually made me smile.
I am one of those editors who has been editing trailers since the early eighties and I am still cutting these days. I am also a company owner always looking for another gifted, motivated and passionate young editor dying to do what I have been blessed to do for over 40 years and join the amazing folks at Rebel.
A couple years ago, I noticed a cut that someone posted here on LinkedIn and it blew me away.
I contacted the person who had done it. He was a junior in college!
Nick Chapman interned for us the next eighteen months and I am proud to say, right after graduating is now one of our amazing editors at Rebel and kicking ass!
Recently I have been receiving amazing cuts from young editors from around the world and they were unbelieavable!
I am happy to say that next month, two high school students will be interning with us at Rebel, one coming all the way from Denmark!
So, the moral of the story is‚Ä¶connect with the people who actually have been doing what you aspire to do, no matter how long they have been doing it and keep showing them your cuts.
They can recognize talent and they are most likely the ones who will be able to provide the opportunity for you to join our amazing industry.

To support the region's rapidly growing energy needs, Entergy Texas submitted a proposal to build two state-of-the-art natural gas power plants in Liberty and Jefferson counties.

We entered into an agreement to acquire WalkMe‚Ñ¢, a prominent leader in digital adoption platforms (DAPs), that perfectly complements SAP Business Transformation portfolio like SAP Signavio and SAP LeanIX. This will further enhance SAP customers‚Äô digital adoption and user productivity.

We acknowledged that transformation is not just technology, but business opportunities to be continuously driven. The value derived from adopting SAP solutions is already immense and will only get better. We estimate SAP customers to benefit from $2.4 trillion in economic savings and $5.4 trillion in revenue increase when adopting our solutions.

It was a pleasure that we were joined by Brian Hardee of PureTech Scientific, Jeff Lischett of Tropicana Brands Group, Ingo Elfering of Fresenius Group and Takuya Sakai of Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. They shared their first-hand experiences in adopting our key solutions like RISE with SAP accelerating with Business AI copilot Joule, to being innovation-ready with clean core ERP. Thank you again all SAP customers for your trust and confidence in us!

We also emphasized our commitment in sustainability, where we continue to strive in creating sustainable solutions that deliver successful business outcomes and positive environmental impact.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-mcmillan-bb8b0a5/,"Memorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, was established after the American Civil War. The first widely recognized observance was on May 30, 1868, when Major General John A. Logan, leader of an organization for Northern Civil War veterans, called for a nationwide day of remembrance. On that day, Americans were encouraged to decorate the graves of soldiers who had died in the Civil War with flowers.

For many years, I have used this day to celebrate and remember my West Point 1989 classmates who are no longer with us. They all left us too soon.

This Memorial Day weekend, if you know a parent, spouse, child, or sibling of someone who served and died, please reach out to them personally. Let them know you remember their sacrifice and that you care.

Here is the full list of my classmates who are no longer with us.

Be thou at peace.

Lea also joined some of our Swiss events throughout the years and always made sure to be giving back to the startup community. She is a real role model!

So, of course, when I first read about the AVA Women exit, I was really happy for her and her team, and then once I heard about the acquiring company declaring bankruptcy shortly afterwards, I was quite saddened at the thought of how this would affect them.

I'd been trying to get Lea on the podcast to talk about everything she's learned along the way for a while now, and it wasn't until startup days 2024 in Bern that I finally succeeded. It was touching, deeply personal and really eye-opening.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelnbloch/,"Das ist die ""Secret Sauce"" hinter heyMia: ü§´

Vor gut einem Jahr war heyMia nur eine Idee. Heute haben wir eine Recruiting-Plattform mit fast 4.000 Talenten und √ºber 200 Kunden. Wie haben wir das so schnell geschafft?

‚û°Ô∏è Unsere ‚ÄúSecret Sauce‚Äù: Low-Code Tools! üßô

Von Anfang an haben Lukas Wohlgemuth und ich auf Low-Code Tools gesetzt, um technologisch sehr schnell voran zu kommen und einfach iterieren zu k√∂nnen.

Das sind die wichtigsten Tools, die sich bei uns bew√§hrt haben: ‚¨áÔ∏è

üß† Airtable: Das Gehirn unseres Gesch√§fts! Damit managen wir unseren Talent-Pool und das CRM, und wir automatisieren Prozesse vom Onboarding bis zum Accounting. Mit Automation Scripts senden wir WhatsApp-Erinnerungen, berechnen Talent-Bewertungen, erstellen die Talent-Dossiers f√ºr Kunden etc.

üåê Make: Oft ben√∂tigen wir neben Airtable noch andere Services/APIs. Mit Make verbinden wir Airtable unter Anderem mit Gmail, Google Drive, Zoom, WhatsApp und PDF-Tools. So k√∂nnen wir komplexe Prozesse abbilden.

üíª Webflow: Unser Webseiten-Wizard. Die erste Version haben wir mit einem angepassten Template (schnell & g√ºnstig!) gebaut, inzwischen haben wir unser eigenes Design entwickelt und bald gehen weitere Features auf heymia.ch live.

üì± Heyflow: Unser Tool zum Erstellen interaktiver, mobil optimierter Flows. Damit f√ºhren wir Talente und Kunden durch den Onboarding-Prozess und k√∂nnen die ben√∂tigten Informationen einfach abfragen.

Als ‚Äúengineer at heart‚Äù bin ich beeindruckt, was dank Low-Code Tools heute m√∂glich ist und wie schnell man damit technisch anspruchsvolle Produkte bauen kann. Und es macht richtig Spass mit diesen Tools zu arbeiten!

Ganz ohne Coding gehts nat√ºrlich schon nicht, auch wenn die Tools das gerne so versprechen. üòÖ Mittlerweile ist unsere eigene Codebase ziemlich gewachsen. Aber h√§tten wir die Low-Code Tools nicht zur Verf√ºgung gehabt, h√§tten wir viel mehr selber entwickeln m√ºssen. Das w√§re deutlich teurer gewesen und h√§tte ein Vielfaches der Zeit ben√∂tigt... üêå

Ich kann Low-Code Tools zum Aufbau von neuen Startups/Produkten und zum Automatisieren von Prozessen also nur empfehlen. ‚úÖ

Was sind deine Erfahrungen mit Low-Code Tools?

_____
‚û°Ô∏è M√∂chtest du Low-Code Tools zuk√ºnftig in deinen Projekten oder deinem Unternehmen einsetzen, um die Effizienz zu steigern oder schnell neue digitale Produkte zu bauen? Let‚Äôs get in touch! üì•

Mein Herz rast, ich bekomme G√§nsehaut und beginne gleichzeitig zu schwitzen. Ich lese einen Artikel, der mit einem Zitat von mir endet ‚Äì in einem der Top-3-Wirtschaftsmagazine Deutschlands. (Link im Kommentar)

W√§hrend es zahlreiche schwule M√§nner in meinem Umfeld gibt, kannte ich zu Beginn meines Outings nur eine einzige Frau, die sich als queer bezeichnete.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelnbloch/,"Lea von Bidder was Swisspreneur's 12th guest way back in 2017, so it would be fair to call her one of our veterans. I first met her in San Francisco and she struck me as an incredibly inspiring person, motivating me to think bigger and be more ambitious.

Lea also joined some of our Swiss events throughout the years and always made sure to be giving back to the startup community. She is a real role model!

So, of course, when I first read about the AVA Women exit, I was really happy for her and her team, and then once I heard about the acquiring company declaring bankruptcy shortly afterwards, I was quite saddened at the thought of how this would affect them.

I'd been trying to get Lea on the podcast to talk about everything she's learned along the way for a while now, and it wasn't until startup days 2024 in Bern that I finally succeeded. It was touching, deeply personal and really eye-opening.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-blake-mba-880a11/,"On November 1st, I am going to retire or as I like to call it ‚Äúre-mission‚Äù from Ascension.  It has been such an honor to serve the Catholic Health Ministry not once but twice in my career.  It was such a privilege to be able to bring my faith to work and not have to separate faith from profession.  I am so grateful to Ascension and its leadership for the opportunity provided to me.  My wife, Liz, and I are going to take a sabbatical and discern about how to re-mission for what we call our third-third.  We want to continue to serve our community and our faith in perhaps a different way than we have done so far.  Below is the announcement that Joe Impicciche sent out internally on my announcement.


Peter Leibold, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer, is planning to leave Ascension on November 1. He will remain engaged with Ascension by serving as a member of the Ascension Foundation Board.‚Ä®‚Ä®A servant leader, Peter worked diligently to advance Ascension‚Äôs Mission and was a key leader in helping our organization navigate through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Advocacy worked with Finance, Legal and Operations to clear regulatory hurdles, obtain needed flexibilities and advocate for significant provider financial relief that was essential for Ascension to serve its communities and take care of its associates.‚Ä®‚Ä®Peter joined Ascension in 2014 and led his team by emphasizing transparency, communication and results. During his tenure, he celebrated Advocacy‚Äôs role in expanding Medicaid in Oklahoma, promoting growth in supplemental payments to several of our ministries, advancing spiritual care as a supplemental Medicare benefit, and discerning with ministries how to comply with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare. Peter brought his whole self to his role, living out his deep faith by advocating for Ascension as a ministry of the church.¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®Peter is a member of the Ascension Leadership Team, Ascension Leadership Academy Community 4 and the Executive Ministry Leadership Formation Cohort 13.‚Ä®‚Ä®He received the David J. Greenburg award, the highest honor provided by the American Health Law Association (AHLA) for service to the health law bar. He has served on various foundation and church boards.¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®Before joining Ascension, Peter served as the CEO of the AHLA for 15 years and was General Counsel of the Catholic Health Association for three years.‚Ä®‚Ä®Peter‚Äôs departure in November provides Ascension time to identify and transition a successor.¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®Please join me in thanking Peter for his service to Ascension and his dedication to our Mission.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-blake-mba-880a11/,MISC,post,Text,John,Blake,Ascension Health,Healthcare Providers,National Head of Health Payers Technology at Ascension,2024-07-01 17:30,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7209759807417765889,,,,,,473,205,0,1w,,,,"John Blake, MBA likes this",Likes,,2024-06-21 03:31,,,,,,,,,Friday,7:31 AM,6/21/2024,Friday,,Engagement,7-8am,,,,,,678,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-bachner/,"Last Thursday, we celebrated a significant milestone with the public launch of Romer Americas. Our goal was to introduce influential parenting content creators in Southern California to Romer's timeless elegance, innovative safety features, and mindfully selected fabrics.

Reflecting on this beautiful event, we extend our gratitude to our hosts Tezza Barton & Rocky Barnes, speaker Dr. Deepika Chopra, and our guests for making it extra special.

We are grateful for the unforgettable venue and catering Santa Monica Proper provided and loved the elevated touch of elegance Love Struck Blooms gave to our #RomerBabyBrunch.

The personalized chain stitching by Large Lemonade and The Altyr energy readings were also a big hit!

A big thank you goes out to MATE the Label and Anima Mundi Herbals for the fabulous gifts as well as to our wonderful teams who planned and captured the event:
üóìÔ∏è Event Planner: Sequin Productions
üì£ PR Team: The Last Layer
üì∏ Photography: Brooke Olsen
üìπ Videographer: Kaleef Parks

Special thanks to all the #Romer employees who helped make this event possible - it takes a village. Lastly, we appreciate the on-site efforts from Kelly Thomas, Nicole Hahn, and Kate Clark, and the behind-the-scenes efforts from the entire Romer brand team back in Fort Mill, SC!

We're thrilled to be so close to shipping our first products this month. Authorized retailers are listed here: https://lnkd.in/etGDznGs.

After an incredible journey at Microsoft, I am announcing my departure from one of the most powerful, innovative, and talent-rich companies in the world. I feel truly blessed for my time here and have met so many incredible people who will remain friends for life. üèÜü•á

I have made the bold decision to leave my favorite workplace to strengthen and utilize my capabilities in transformational leadership, a passion close to my heart. I have said yes to one of Danish history‚Äôs most significant transformation cases at TDC Erhverv, where I will take on the role of Senior Vice President for Enterprise and join the Executive Board.

Starting July 1st at TDC Erhverv, my responsibility will be to accelerate the sales of end-to-end solutions and advanced services to enterprise and public customers. This initiative aims to solidify our market leadership as the only provider capable of delivering across all technologies.

There is a special reason I chose TDC Erhverv:
""TDC Erhverv is a strong and iconic brand that is on an exciting and ambitious transformation journey. My passion and strength lie in transforming organizations through modern change management, making a noticeable difference internally in the company culture and contributing to strengthening customers' digital journeys and business results. I look forward to contributing to strengthening our focus on spreading end-to-end value-based digital and AI solutions for the benefit of Danish society.‚Äù

I would like to thank Microsoft for the most developing years of my career. You are sending me out into the big world so much wiser and prepared for the challenges ahead. Thanks, from the bottom of my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you to the leadership, my team, my colleagues, and ALL our partners and friends in the ecosystem. You have ALL made the last 3.5 years incredible. #MemoriesForLife Together, we have built history. Thanks for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for all your support, partnership, and innovation.

See you all again one day üëå And to all my new friends - see you soon. I‚Äôm so excited to meet you all‚Ä¶

Our life is a book consisting of many chapters. This is just one of them. üòò Remember to enjoy every step you take... We don‚Äôt know how many we will take.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-osborne-b83486166/,"Zions Bank and World Trade Center Utah (WTC Utah) Crossroads of the World truly put Utah on the map as they brought some of the worlds most influential leaders

A few Highlights

‚≠êÔ∏èFormer President George W. Bush was wonderfully engaging and personable. His humor had the crowd roaring and should be a stand up comedian, however his humor was interspersed with truly insightful and deeply meaningful (sometimes emotional) discussions on the hardships and care he has had for not only for the people of our nation, but all people ‚Äî the women and children harmed as we left Afghanistan, the challenges for those impacted by our border challenges with Mexico, and the anger experienced on 9/11. Making me realize just how much broader our perspectives need to be.

‚≠êÔ∏è Mexico‚Äôs former President, Vicente. Fox discussing the opportunity for nearshore resourcing ‚Äî so true, and I am working with companies in Utah that are building strong workforces based in Mexico and see how much we could expand in this arena.

‚≠êÔ∏è Former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper was insightful on trade economics, and not onboard with any of the current proposed Utah National Hockey League (NHL) team names. (I tend to agree and truly hope ‚ÄúYeti‚Äù does not stick!)

‚≠êÔ∏è Recognition of the incredible impact Scott Anderson has made to our state presented by our current Governor Spencer Cox along with prior Governors Gary Herbert, Jon Huntsman and Michael Leavitt

‚≠êÔ∏è Meeting with Derek Kitchen, prior State Senator and current Sr. VP & Deputy Director Congressional on the work happening within Export-Import Bank of the United States and FireFly Automatix, Inc.

‚≠êÔ∏è UVU President Astrid S. Tuminez interview with Richard Haass created awareness of the sensitivity of our global relations, the risks, and our role in becoming  informed. Having a marine son stationed in Okinawa these conversations become all too real, and his direct calls to action were welcomed (I did leave having bought 2 of his books.) üòÇ

Being busy can be a state of constant motion without a clear purpose or direction. It can involve juggling multiple tasks without making significant headway in any one area.

At one of my son‚Äôs recent high school graduation, I was inspired hearing the wonderful ambitions so many young men and women are pursuing.

If I had known then what I know now, here are a few things I would tell new graduates:

1-The best opportunities for you may be far from home; pursue them now before other family and life demands grow in complexity.

2-Stay in contact with your good high school friends over the many years ahead; long friendships can be among the richest and they will eventually need you, and you them.

3-It sounds like everyone has a plan and their life is all perfectly mapped out while you are left behind trying to figure things out. They don‚Äôt. Move forward and make each achievement a building block for the next one.

4-If there was a special someone you always wanted to date in high school but didn‚Äôt, ask them out now. You‚Äôre out of high school and nobody cares anymore.

5-Your parents are suddenly much smarter now than they have been the past four years you were in high school. Ask for their advice and actually listen to it.

6-If you stay in shape, you‚Äôll never have to get back into shape.

7-The best employers look for talent, then passion, and then personality. Develop those, and you will always be in demand.

8-The decisions you now make over the next four years of your life will determine much of what the rest of your life looks like. Shoot for the stars and don‚Äôt settle for subpar.

9-If you didn‚Äôt like the ‚Äúbox‚Äù that you were in or known for during high school, change it now. You write your present and future however you want it.

10-Thank your teachers and coaches every time you see them from now on. Decades from now you will still be quoting them and doing those same drills they had you do with your children‚Äôs teams that you coach!

The future is bright for all 2024 graduates and here‚Äôs to wishing you the very best of success!!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/katyaandresen/,"I continue to hold two different views of AI - I see the benefits and potential but also the downside.  If you only see the benefits and get sucked into the hype, you can run into trouble.  If you only focus on the downside, you potentially miss out on the benefits.  I want to leverage the good while mitigating the downsides - which means understanding it and making sure your staff understand it and have formal responsible use guidelines and training.

That's why I read both critical and praising articles/reviews about AI, especially AI product releases. And, also put my hands on it myself to experience with benefits and drawbacks.

This a critical review of chatGPT4o and worth a read. The author points out the demo was a ""preview"" of advanced features being tested in controlled ways. The actual product release did not have all the features calling it a ""bait and switch.""  That's hype.  He compared it to product releases like mobile phones that show features in release demos that are actually in the product release.

""This tactic, in which A.I. companies promise wild new features and deliver a half-baked product, is becoming a trend that is bound to confuse and frustrate people . . . With artificial intelligence, companies are giving a preview of a potential future, demonstrating technologies that are being developed and working only in limited, controlled conditions. A mature, reliable product might arrive ‚Äî or might not.""

He goes onto review the new features or ""improvements"" that were in the product release.He shares a couple of detailed examples of the common problem with LLMs, even this new improved version: hallucinations.  The models provide outright or subtle wrong answers or made up answers reinforcing the need to really check its work and not fall asleep at the wheel.

This article reminds us that when companies rush to release half-baked product, users are the product.  OpenAI said its iterative approach to updating ChatGPT allowed it to gather feedback to make improvements. ‚ÄúWe believe it‚Äôs important to preview our advanced models to give people a glimpse of their capabilities and to help us understand their real-world applications,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

The bottom line from this review:

A major thing OpenAI got right with ChatGPT-4o is making the technology free for people to try. Free is the right price: Since we are helping to train these A.I. systems with our data to improve, we shouldn‚Äôt be paying for them.
The best of A.I. has yet to come, and it might one day be a good math tutor that we want to talk to. But we should believe it when we see it ‚Äî and hear it.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-perry-8562347/,"Looking back at her teenaged self when she had been recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Emily Browne she says she was the direct beneficiary of the advances St. Jude has made in methotrexate pharmacodynamics and the pursuit to replace cranial radiation with intrathecal therapy. Now two decades into her career at St. Jude and nearly 29 years since her diagnosis, Browne shares her story in honor of National Cancer Survivors Day. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it then, but my journey to St. Jude began September 11, 1995, when I was diagnosed,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs a 17-year-old, I didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúoncology‚Äù meant, only that my pediatrician was concerned about my lab results and persistent fever. I found myself in a clinic in my hometown of Birmingham surrounded by children with cancer, oblivious to the fact that I was about to become one of them.‚Äù 

Fast forward and Browne began in a dream job in a clinic at St. Jude. It was then she began to understand and appreciate the enormous impact that St. Jude researchers like Dr. Ching-Hong Pui and countless others had on advancing the cure rates and improving the quality of life of all children with cancer, including herself. Over the past 20 years, she has worked in a variety of capacities at Jude ‚Äì from Leukemia & Lymphoma to nursing, and now the Transition Oncology Program.  As director of the fledgling program, Browne offers her perspective, knowledge and experience to better understand the psychosocial and physical health needs of patients and families as they transition off cancer-directed therapy and for the next few years of early survivorship. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been amazing to experience different career paths without ever leaving St. Jude,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine working anywhere else!‚Äù

The event, held in Las Vegas, is a technology showcase held for HPE business and government customers. 

During the session, Perry said he and his staff see key training opportunities in respect to AI that work to enhance the productivity of highly skilled clinical, research, and administrative professionals. These groups all need to have both a grasp on the evolution of AI, as well as how it can and will impact their respective operations. 

To help advance our knowledge and discovery of pediatric diseases, St. Jude built a GenAI framework to integrate deep learning models into data science programs. The effort supports the institution's ongoing strategic investments in data science, which date back to the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project which at the time was the largest investment and most comprehensive effort to identify and understand the genetic origins of cancer. 

Perry was also recently honored by Becker's Healthcare‚Äôs 2024 ‚ÄúCIOs to know‚Äù list, which recognizes IT executives at health systems and hospitals throughout the U.S. who are leading strategic initiatives, implementing new electronic health record systems, enhancing cybersecurity and deploying telehealth services.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-perry-8562347/,"Looking back at her teenaged self when she had been recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Emily Browne she says she was the direct beneficiary of the advances St. Jude has made in methotrexate pharmacodynamics and the pursuit to replace cranial radiation with intrathecal therapy. Now two decades into her career at St. Jude and nearly 29 years since her diagnosis, Browne shares her story in honor of National Cancer Survivors Day. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it then, but my journey to St. Jude began September 11, 1995, when I was diagnosed,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs a 17-year-old, I didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúoncology‚Äù meant, only that my pediatrician was concerned about my lab results and persistent fever. I found myself in a clinic in my hometown of Birmingham surrounded by children with cancer, oblivious to the fact that I was about to become one of them.‚Äù 

Fast forward and Browne began in a dream job in a clinic at St. Jude. It was then she began to understand and appreciate the enormous impact that St. Jude researchers like Dr. Ching-Hong Pui and countless others had on advancing the cure rates and improving the quality of life of all children with cancer, including herself. Over the past 20 years, she has worked in a variety of capacities at Jude ‚Äì from Leukemia & Lymphoma to nursing, and now the Transition Oncology Program.  As director of the fledgling program, Browne offers her perspective, knowledge and experience to better understand the psychosocial and physical health needs of patients and families as they transition off cancer-directed therapy and for the next few years of early survivorship. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been amazing to experience different career paths without ever leaving St. Jude,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine working anywhere else!‚Äù

I shared my thoughts on how culture is the essence of how we operate and interact within our environment. Leadership can set the vision and direction, but it's our teams that truly drive the culture forward. Cultural growth and change emerge from the collective actions, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals across all levels of the organization.

As leaders, our role is to create an environment that empowers and inspires our teams to embody the desired culture and conditions for success. By fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity, we can create a thriving workplace where employees feel valued, engaged, and motivated.
Thank you to everyone who attended and contributed to such a meaningful discussion!

It was AWESOME to come together with so many leaders from across the state ‚Äì including our co-owners, Governor Brian Kemp, members of the Georgia Public Service Commission and other elected officials ‚Äì to celebrate this historic achievement. On behalf of the thousands of employees and craft labor who have worked on this project, we are so thankful to our partners who were steadfast, loyal and strong ‚Äî partners who worked together with us through challenges and successes along the way. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but we stayed focused on safety and quality to get the job done to benefit our customers and the state of Georgia for generations to come.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennycoleman-soco/,MISC,,Image,Kenny,Coleman,CenterPoint Energy,Utilities,SVP & CIO,2024-07-02 15:42,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7202067023516835842,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQHfW-If8U64bw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1717097448905?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=EgMeR8lmIMCNoEj2WVR1q4SowifEayTuT40fIIRVR24,,,,,2005,105,27,1mo,,,,Kenny Coleman likes this,Likes,,2024-05-30 18:03,,,,,,,,,Thursday,10:03 PM,5/30/2024,Thursday,,Engagement,10-11pm,,,,,,2137,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-nimsger/,"This chart about the costs of training AI large language models (LLMs) caught my attention. Economic theory‚Äîparticularly in the technology industry‚Äîhas long suggested that supply-side innovation can cause prices to fall rapidly for critical infrastructure, even with increasing demand. Think of computer hardware and semiconductor chips as prime examples. 

Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, saw that theory in action. Moore observed that as the number of transistors on a computer chip doubled over a period of about 18 months, the price of the chip over the same period fell by about half. That was way back in 1965‚Äîand the so-called ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs law‚Äù for chip progress and pricing has continued to hold roughly true for the nearly six decades since (a veritable eon in the tech world). But fast forward to 2024, and generative AI seems to be turning Moore‚Äôs law on its head: costs of training the next generation of LLMs aren‚Äôt halving; instead, prices have roughly doubled every nine months. 

So what explains this reversal? It‚Äôs all about how LLMs scale.

To date, many of the AI race‚Äôs main drivers have seemed to be hyper-fixated on scaling up the existing architecture. Many LLM champions believe that to get to where AI wants to go, ‚Äúscale is all you need‚Äù. Just make the transformer models bigger and more powerful, their thinking goes, and LLMs will revolutionize the economy and‚Äîfor some‚Äîlead to artificial generalized intelligence. That view is why frontier model company CEOs talk about numbers like $10-billion training costs for a model and a $100-billion supercomputer.
 
But today, I‚Äôm hearing more and more about scaling down. In stark contrast to LLMs, the small language model (SLM) ‚Äútheory‚Äù is that smaller models, more tightly engineered for narrower applications and domains, will increasingly supplant LLMs. The same way that fine-tuned four-cylinder engines in a modern BMW 4 series outperform (more horsepower with better gas efficiency) the V8 450-cubic-inch engines that used to power Corvettes. SLMs are also typically trained on finely curated high-quality data sets‚Äîanalogous to the high-octane gas that the four-cylinder engine needs to use. As such, the costs of SLMs may map more closely to¬†Moore‚Äôs law than their large-language counterparts. 

For the moment, developers and investors are essentially betting on both of these theories‚ÄîLLMs and SLMs‚Äîsimultaneously. However, that probably won‚Äôt continue forever in the same fashion. 

‚ÄúScale-is-all-you-need‚Äù LLMs will have to demonstrate extraordinary ROI to justify their $100-billion price tags, while SLMs will have to prove that they are flexible enough to fit multiple use cases and continue to improve their efficiency at domain-specific tasks. Companies adopting AI will also need to decide when they need a fine-tuned BMW and when they need a powerhouse Corvette. 

I believe this is one of the most fascinating and consequential races in the AI world right now‚Ä¶and one to watch closely.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-nimsger/,AI/Machine Learning,infographic,Image,Kristin,Nimsger,Thoma Bravo,Private Equity,Operating Partner,2024-07-02 16:12,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7212263893224579073,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEruMb6AFWI8Q/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1719520679803?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=CBsFX4djeImiVTgVVS5_e6ccuIUPDsPnkEKtUFQ5bbM,,,genAI,checked,523,26,35,4d,,,,Kristin Nimsger Weston likes this,Likes,,2024-06-27 21:21,,,,,,,,,Friday,1:21 AM,6/28/2024,Friday,,Engagement,1-2am,,,,,,584,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdco‚Äôs platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = ‚ù§Ô∏è: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Global Thought Leaders: From global creative leaders Rob Reilly, Alexandre Abrantes, Jo Shoesmith, Claudine Cheever, Chaka Sobhani, to storytellers like Double Oscar Winner Ben Proudfoot, we hosted insightful talks that challenged the status quo and ignited a passion for innovation.

The Business of Women‚Äôs Sports Take Center Stage: We spotlighted the booming business of women's sports with two powerful panels including Thayer Lavielle, Heather Hopkins Freeland, Flaujae Johnson, Angela Ruggiero, Jessica Berman, Meg Linehan. Smartly sits at the heart of the social & streaming channels driving this growth. #InvestInHer

Leaving Cannes, we're energized to lead the charge towards a future where intelligent creative fuels brand love and growth. The best is yet to come! #SmartlyatCannes2024 #CannesLions2024

üî•Think AI as super automization
üî•Everyone in the creative field needs to be interested in technology

""The next generation isn't going to be thinking ""men's sports/ women's sports - they're thinking sports"" Heather Hopkins Freeland, Adobe

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradesmond/,"Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Lions is a wrap, and Smartly came to play. Here's a glimpse into our week of sparking industry love and creative revolution, anchored by our campaign of Falling back in love with advertising again:

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdco‚Äôs platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = ‚ù§Ô∏è: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Global Thought Leaders: From global creative leaders Rob Reilly, Alexandre Abrantes, Jo Shoesmith, Claudine Cheever, Chaka Sobhani, to storytellers like Double Oscar Winner Ben Proudfoot, we hosted insightful talks that challenged the status quo and ignited a passion for innovation.

The Business of Women‚Äôs Sports Take Center Stage: We spotlighted the booming business of women's sports with two powerful panels including Thayer Lavielle, Heather Hopkins Freeland, Flaujae Johnson, Angela Ruggiero, Jessica Berman, Meg Linehan. Smartly sits at the heart of the social & streaming channels driving this growth. #InvestInHer

Leaving Cannes, we're energized to lead the charge towards a future where intelligent creative fuels brand love and growth. The best is yet to come! #SmartlyatCannes2024 #CannesLions2024

Inspiring conversation at the Smartly Penthouse about the role of Brands on the Women's sports rocketship:
""Brands aren't just doing it to check a box or to be popular. It's to build business. If you can show that it can be a thriving profitable growing business, then you just through some barriers that are incredibly important for society. Brands and partners who get that are special.""

I am proud to be an investor in the Chicago Red Stars, and see Owner, Laura Ricketts & Team President, Karen Leetzow do amazing and inspiring things to lead this team to great heights.

Here are a few inspiring quotes from yesterday‚Äôs panel:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to us by purpose  to invest in Women‚Äôs Sports and shine a light on what women can do.‚Äù Laura Ricketts 

‚ÄúA big difference I see in terms of investing in women‚Äôs sports, is how social media and streaming showed the data that viewership, engagement and interest was there in the women‚Äôs game.  This was a big shift and compelled investors and media companies to take a fresh look‚Äù.   Ally Wagner (Bay FC Founder & former USWNT Soccer Player).

‚ÄúWe have the platform to bring women‚Äôs sports to every HH in the US.  We think Women‚Äôs sports is a great business and we want to lead the media industry in championing it‚Ä¶..part of the problem is there is audience for the games but you can‚Äôt find enough of the product on air‚Ä¶..we‚Äôre going to change‚Äù.

Our new research, launched at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity deep dives into how people across generations & demographics want brands to show up across their brand experience journey. Here are a few highlights:

‚Ä¢When consumers are in the discovery phase, production quality of the ad is 2x more important than the product featured, alone.

‚Ä¢Mirroring Gen Z's preferences, 52% of Gen Alpha gravitate towards short- form videos between 2-5 minutes. However, longer content isn't entirely out of favor.

‚Ä¢In the Mid Funnel Consideration phase, consumers want to see Product, Product, Product. Product information is 2.4x more effective than price and promotion. 

‚Ä¢Price and promotions are not in the top five most important creative considerations during the Discovery & Consideration phases of their brand experience journey.

‚Ä¢Only at the purchase phase of the brand experience journey, do consumers rate the actual product offer the most important. Product is 1.6x more important than production which is rated #1 in the Discovery phase.

‚Ä¢While affordability remains a consideration, product information trumps price promotions when influencing purchase decisions.

People are looking for a journey, not a sales pitch. They want brands to guide them from discovery to consideration to action, with creative messaging that truly resonates.

We kicked off the week with a powerful article from Laura Desmond:
""Reinvention is at the heart of advertising, from the age of media to the rise of AI, our industry has constantly adapted. We dared to transform Cannes in 2005, and the data-driven, programmatic era followed. But consumers are telling us the experience is broken: irrelevant ads, exploding production costs, and a lack of privacy. It's time to fall in love with advertising again. We need to bring creative, media, and intelligence together to create meaningful experiences that power brand love and performance. Brands that tightly connect creative with media, think full-funnel, and leverage AI will win."" 

Our First Smartly Branded Cannes HQ: We brought the Smartly vibe with a stunning Croisette view from our penthouse rooftop, hosting industry legends across holdco‚Äôs platforms, brands and sports & fueling passionate conversations about the power of technology to power creativity. #FallInLoveWithAdvertisingAgain

Tech + Creativity = ‚ù§Ô∏è: We championed the power of creative technology to reignite brand love and unlock growth. Smartly is the bridge between the fragmented landscape and a future of storytelling that's both creative & impactful.

Global Thought Leaders: From global creative leaders Rob Reilly, Alexandre Abrantes, Jo Shoesmith, Claudine Cheever, Chaka Sobhani, to storytellers like Double Oscar Winner Ben Proudfoot, we hosted insightful talks that challenged the status quo and ignited a passion for innovation.

The Business of Women‚Äôs Sports Take Center Stage: We spotlighted the booming business of women's sports with two powerful panels including Thayer Lavielle, Heather Hopkins Freeland, Flaujae Johnson, Angela Ruggiero, Jessica Berman, Meg Linehan. Smartly sits at the heart of the social & streaming channels driving this growth. #InvestInHer

Leaving Cannes, we're energized to lead the charge towards a future where intelligent creative fuels brand love and growth. The best is yet to come! #SmartlyatCannes2024 #CannesLions2024

üåü It‚Äôs about stepping out of your comfort zone, facing fears head-on, learning from each bump, and growing stronger with every step forward.

üåü It‚Äôs simple, really. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can. The magic happens when you push a little further each day, dare to do something new, and embrace the uncertainties.

üåü Yes, it‚Äôs scary. But it‚Äôs also where you find new strengths, meet unexpected joys, and discover what you‚Äôre truly capable of.

üåü A comfort zone is a beautiful place ‚Äì but nothing ever grows there!

Reflecting on my own financial journey, I realize now how much small changes can make a huge difference. It's something I wish I had known sooner! From not saving early enough to feeling too embarrassed to ask questions, these are common regrets I've heard from so many women.

In my latest blog post, I share insights from my own experiences and interviews with amazing women. Whether it's understanding tax-deferred savings, leveraging work benefits, or just getting more involved in your finances, there's always room for improvement.

Here's the full blog post with some ideas on how to move forward to start making better decisions today:

Working under Jethro Elvin's leadership has been a privilege, and I'm grateful for the chance to dig deep into Basware's offerings and validate firsthand why they are the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation.

However, the opportunity to spearhead the global sales of AP Assurance was too compelling to pass up. This game-changing solution offers the most effective and user-friendly approach to improving working capital, which I've encountered in my experience at both SAP and Basware.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmccarthynyc/,"The End of an Era

This week marks a significant turning point as I've made the decision to leave Coupa Software. This decision is wrapped in immense pride and gratitude to my colleagues (and former colleagues!), customers, partners, industry analysts, and board members from all stages. 

Walking through the Coupa doors 13 years ago, I could never have imagined the phenomenal story we'd create. We started as a fledgling company with a bold vision: to become a Salesforce -like platform for Business Spend Management. We had big dreams and even bigger determination, evident by the post-it notes that adorned our (budget-less) walls!

What followed was phenomenal growth. We grew Coupa from $1 million in recurring revenue into a $1 billion powerhouse. We built a differentiated platform, powered by an innovative community AI model. We cultivated a vibrant customer community with our spirit of ‚Äúensure customer success‚Äù driving our decisions. 

We earned over 100 software patents (24 with my name), secured leadership positions in 150+ analyst reports, and went toe-to-toe with SAP! Along the way, we had an incredible IPO, a meteoric public market rise, and ultimately, a successful Thoma Bravo privatization valued at a staggering $8 billion.

The memories I'll cherish most are the incredible IPO experience, the epic hackathons (even if held in a tiny bank vault!), fun customer advisory boards that embodied the spirit of ""none of us is as smart as all of us,"" the thrilling Great Race-style global sales cycles, and of course, the goofy product videos that hopefully made people outside Coupa laugh as much as they made us laugh in Coupa! 

To the wonderful colleagues (past and present), customers, partners, analysts, and board members that spent so much time collaborating with me personally on this journey, thank you from the bottom of my heart. It‚Äôs been an absolute honor working alongside such brilliant, hardworking, and dedicated people. I could never have played my role in Coupa‚Äôs success without you. I hope our roads cross in the future. 

While my journey at Coupa comes to a close, a new and exciting chapter for me awaits. I'm excited for the next challenge and can't wait to share the details with you all next week! In typical Donna fashion, I start on Monday. üòÄ 

In the meantime, tell me about your favorite Coupa memories below. Let's celebrate the incredible journey we've been on!

It has been a pleasure and an honor to watch the company grow into the indisputable leader in #SustainableProcurement, a market category that just barely existed when I joined nearly seven years ago. 
 
There have been so many remarkable milestones along the way. Working to make Business Sustainability Ratings a mainstream concept. Figuring out how we should pronounce our name (ee-koh-vah-dis)! Driving partnerships and integrations with all the Source to Pay and TPRM colleagues. Developing the eLearning Academy so suppliers could embrace improvement. All seven amazing SUSTAIN events, especially pivoting to an online conference just 10 days after the world locked down in 2020. Supporting two major funding rounds. Establishing critical NPS processes and insights to inform our direction. Creating so much compelling thought leadership that the share of voice is nearly unbelievable. Officially becoming a purpose-led business to ‚ÄúGuide all companies to a sustainable world.‚Äù Helping grow the EcoVadis solution portfolio and network to over 2.4M screened suppliers and 140K+ rated suppliers ‚Äì and revelling as more companies than ever discover Sustain +Ability, getting a rating WITHOUT BEING ASKED ‚Äì because it‚Äôs good business. Partnering closely with sales to achieve 10x+ ARR from 2017 to now. Navigating more acronyms and regulations than I may care to remember üòä. 

And most proudly - building from a team of 5 marketers to over 50, including dozens of nationalities, locations and functions ‚Äì and somehow still creating a tight-knit group that cares deeply for each other while executing like crazy. Working with you all has been an absolute joy. 
 
My sincerest thanks to our co-CEOs, Pierre-Francois Thaler and Frederic Trinel, for this incredible opportunity to cut my teeth as a #CMO - I have learned and grown so much. To my EcoVadis leadership colleagues and all EcoVadians with whom I‚Äôve dived deep day in and day out, thank you for your collaboration, persistence, passion and optimism ‚Äì you are changing the world one company at a time. And to my dear EV marketers ‚Äì thank you for everything - keep innovating and reaching for the stars. I will miss you most. C√©cile Dorvault David McClintock Meena Hans Robert Altman Angie Marcel Daniel Perry

I will keep EcoVadis in my heart and cheerlead your purpose and success always!
 
What‚Äôs next? I‚Äôll be starting on an exciting new journey later in July. Stay tuned for the news but ‚Äì spoiler alert ‚Äì I‚Äôm still a procurement software geek üòä!

Someone at work once criticized me I for taking on too much at once. And that stuck with me for a while. So against all my natural tendencies, I deliberately narrowed my professional focus. Not only was it hard, but I was actually LESS productive. You see, ideation is what runs through my veins- it‚Äôs what powers me. Removing my source of inspiration is like taking the engine out of a car and expecting it to run. What I‚Äôve come to realize is that ‚Äútoo much‚Äù is when I am at my best.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmccarthynyc/,"I'm shutting down my startup, RAVACAN.

5 years after I founded it.

Here are 5 lessons and reflections:

‚Üì

1. We don't have product-market fit

- Building an enterprise-grade software is incredibly costly
- No buying intent from Direct procurement
- Procurement managers lack the authority to drive changes internally

2. Creating a new category is hard

- Manufacturing companies prefer highly customizable solutions over SAAS
- Educating the market about a new category requires significant time and resources
- Buyers can't compare and feel the risk is higher

3. Why I'm Stopping This

- We had minimal returns despite significant effort
- We cannot build what the market needs with minimal capital, and open-source solutions exist (more on this soon!)
- Manufacturers are secretive and don't share the word with their peers even when they are very happy

4. Things I Would Have Done Differently

- Targeted more dynamic niches like semiconductors or raw materials
- Engage smaller companies instead of enterprises
- Offer the product for free to get references

5. My Most Critical Learnings

- Don't build something people need, but something they want
- Better be the second best than the first (Edit: Better be challenger than pioneer)
- Use funding momentum and don't let it go away

Richard Branson said, ""The brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all."" I try to live by this every day.

On one hand, it's tough to shut down something I've poured my heart into. 
On the other hand, I feel a sense of relief and gratitude. The journey with RAVACAN has been an incredible learning experience. The lessons I've gained, the skills I've developed, and the insights I've gathered are invaluable.

While RAVACAN's chapter is closing, these experiences will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors. I‚Äôm eager to apply what I‚Äôve learned to whatever comes next.

Finding ways to unwind is an important part of being at your best in work and everyday life. As someone who finds it hard to fully switch off - yes, if you email me, I‚Äôll probably still reply‚Ä¶

I never said it was easy!

When you enjoy what you do and work for great companies, it‚Äôs easy to blur the lines and be overactive. Sometimes, a few days recharging and reflecting is just what the doctor ordered. A few days in Rhodes, Greece should do the trick!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,"Watching a recent ONC Certification program roundtable and realizing how directly the ONC targeted Epic/Abridge with the way they tailored ""Decision support interventions"" (¬ß170.315(b)(11)) in the HTI-1 final rule.

As a reminder, Abridge is part of Epic's Vendor Services program, but specifically an elite tier (Workshop). This is reserved for:
1. Apps building something Epic does not want to build, but wants to be able to be leading in (this applies to both Toolbox and Workshop tiers)
2. Apps that Epic has chosen to codevelop the cutting edge APIs and UX to accomplish those workflows (this applies to just Workshop)

""Decision support interventions"" is intended to replace an existing criteria ""clinical decision support"" (¬ß‚Äâ170.315(a)(9)) to introduce information transparency to address uncertainty regarding the quality of predictive DSIs. The criteria requires surfacing ""source attributes"" about AI algorithms. This is an important and valuable criteria, but it is burdensome - AI is not great at sourcing, as we've seen in the news.

What's interesting is the proposed rule, this criterion applied to ""developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface with predictive DSIs"". That's a broad range - any interfaced DSI would be somewhat looped into providing these source attributes.

In the final rule, the scope of impacted Predictive DSIs was narrowed to  ""supplied by a developer of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module¬†""

In the webinar, it seems that language was intended to loop in Abridge and Epic:

Audience member: ""The first one here is going with the NES analogy if both Game cartridges can be seen in the Nintendo store, does that imply ""stewardship""? Both games can integrate with the NES APIs and Nintendo wants to show that availability is possible but only one game was developed collaboratively""
Jeff Smith (ONC): ""The answer to the question is that the kind of source attribute and intervention risk management requirements would only pertain to the game that was developed collaboratively. We know several developers have App Stores but we don't consider predictive DSIs that are offered through the App Store ""supplied by"" unless the developer themselves have gone to promote a specific predictive DSI that they have collaboratively worked with... simply listing a predictive DSI in a developer's App Store does not mean that that predictive DSi is necessarily supplied by developer so just being in the App
Store isn't a determinative quality.""

Being an EHR partner is a significant tailwind, for sure, but with that comes a required regulatory burden that competitive ambient/AI solutions are not regulated by. This is good news for ambient/AI startups trying to ""fast follow"" - they're hypothetically able to use the APIs Abridge and Epic create, but don't necessarily have to implement the sourcing. I wonder if health systems demand DSI for all their AI solutions, though.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,MISC,,Article,Matt ,Kamen,Optum Inc.,Healthcare Providers,Chief Strategy & Analytics Officer,2024-07-01 17:44,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7210102671557431296,,,,,,54,15,0,1w,,,https://youtu.be/k6tjJZj98LA?t=3281,Matt Kamen liked Ayokunle Omojola‚Äôs comment on this,Liked a comment,,2024-06-22 02:13,,,,,,,,,Saturday,6:13 AM,6/22/2024,Saturday,,Engagement,6-7am,,,,,,69,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,"Watching a recent ONC Certification program roundtable and realizing how directly the ONC targeted Epic/Abridge with the way they tailored ""Decision support interventions"" (¬ß170.315(b)(11)) in the HTI-1 final rule.

As a reminder, Abridge is part of Epic's Vendor Services program, but specifically an elite tier (Workshop). This is reserved for:
1. Apps building something Epic does not want to build, but wants to be able to be leading in (this applies to both Toolbox and Workshop tiers)
2. Apps that Epic has chosen to codevelop the cutting edge APIs and UX to accomplish those workflows (this applies to just Workshop)

""Decision support interventions"" is intended to replace an existing criteria ""clinical decision support"" (¬ß‚Äâ170.315(a)(9)) to introduce information transparency to address uncertainty regarding the quality of predictive DSIs. The criteria requires surfacing ""source attributes"" about AI algorithms. This is an important and valuable criteria, but it is burdensome - AI is not great at sourcing, as we've seen in the news.

What's interesting is the proposed rule, this criterion applied to ""developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface with predictive DSIs"". That's a broad range - any interfaced DSI would be somewhat looped into providing these source attributes.

In the final rule, the scope of impacted Predictive DSIs was narrowed to  ""supplied by a developer of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module¬†""

In the webinar, it seems that language was intended to loop in Abridge and Epic:

Audience member: ""The first one here is going with the NES analogy if both Game cartridges can be seen in the Nintendo store, does that imply ""stewardship""? Both games can integrate with the NES APIs and Nintendo wants to show that availability is possible but only one game was developed collaboratively""
Jeff Smith (ONC): ""The answer to the question is that the kind of source attribute and intervention risk management requirements would only pertain to the game that was developed collaboratively. We know several developers have App Stores but we don't consider predictive DSIs that are offered through the App Store ""supplied by"" unless the developer themselves have gone to promote a specific predictive DSI that they have collaboratively worked with... simply listing a predictive DSI in a developer's App Store does not mean that that predictive DSi is necessarily supplied by developer so just being in the App
Store isn't a determinative quality.""

Being an EHR partner is a significant tailwind, for sure, but with that comes a required regulatory burden that competitive ambient/AI solutions are not regulated by. This is good news for ambient/AI startups trying to ""fast follow"" - they're hypothetically able to use the APIs Abridge and Epic create, but don't necessarily have to implement the sourcing.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mckamen/,"I‚Äôm happy to announce that after what felt like the longest 7 months of my life, I‚Äôve finally removed my green banner! I‚Äôll have more on where I‚Äôm going next and the people who were instrumental in helping me get there a little later on.

For now, there are a couple of things at the very top of my mind as I start the next chapter of my career:

Without my support system, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it through the last half year. First and foremost, I want to thank my wife Erin Powell, who was my financial and emotional rock throughout the weeks and weeks and months and months of applications, cover letters, interviews and disappointment. She kept me together and kept our family‚Äôs collective heads above water, and I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be right now without her. Someday, I‚Äôll also tell my son how, as a toddler, he helped his dad through one of the most challenging periods of his life just by being a smiling and giggling source of joy, energy and motivation who served as a much-needed distraction from my situation. My family, friends and former colleagues have all been heavily involved in keeping me going. The messages of encouragement and support. The offers to help set up connections and conversations, or to even just take a look at my resum√© and offer feedback or advice. The silver lining through all of this is that I have a lot of people in my corner, more than I ever even knew, who were willing to be my champion or a sympathetic ear. Words can‚Äôt adequately express my gratitude for the love and support I‚Äôve received since day one when I was laid off and nearly every day since. I was down bad, and you all helped lift me up.

To my fellow green banners who are still hoping to get that call or email with a job offer attached to it, I want to let you know that I see you and support you. The job market is a cruel and miserable pit of despair right now. The ghosting, rejection and silence can all feel overwhelming at times. People can tell you there will be light at the end of the tunnel, and while there will be, it can be so hard to look beyond your current situation. It‚Äôs always easy to tell you not to take things personally, it‚Äôs just business, but few things impact your personal life more than your professional life. It‚Äôs okay to feel angry or frustrated or sad. All I can say is to keep going, believe in yourself and your talents and, most importantly, take the occasional day to yourself to do the things that you love with the people you love. Something will come along eventually. If ever there is a chance for me to help you the way so many others have helped me along the way, please reach out. Unemployment is a long and lonely road, no matter how many people you have in your corner, so don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I believe in you.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"Design is broken. Young and not-so-young designers are becoming increasingly aware of this. Many feel impotent: they were told they had the tools to make the world a better place, but instead the world takes its toll on them. Beyond a haze of hype and bold claims lies a barren land of self-doubt and impostor syndrome. Although these feels might be the Millennial norm, design culture reinforces them. In conferences we learn that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" but, when it comes to real-life clients, all they ask is to ""make the logo bigger.""

Silvio Lorusso's book 'What Design Can't Do' probes the disillusionment that permeates design. It tackles the deskilling effects provoked by digital semi-automation, the instances of ornamental politics fashioned to please the museum-educational complex, the nebulous promises of design schools.

I have had many absolutely amazing supportive team members and bosses, who have shown me respect and care throughout my career as a researcher. I would not be the colleague I am today without my people.

However, many people who come out as transgender lose their networks in the process of sharing their identity. Those networks are key to everything from finding a job to overall well-being. To celebrate Pride month and give back to my community, I'm participating in a challenge to walk/run 30 miles to help fundraise for the Trans Lifeline. They are there for those folks who lose their networks, providing material support for trans folk who are in crisis.

If you're moved to do so, your donations will go to making sure that trans folks get access to material support when they are in crisis. If you're not able to donate, please consider sharing this fundraiser or starting your own. <3

Happy (almost) Pride Month, friends!

I am excited for what lies ahead and for the incredible opportunities I have had. I have a few months left and may still be with Walmart when I choose my next move.

My journey at Walmart has been incredible, concepting and designing industry shifting products with my partners and leading teams like 2fa, Ask Sam, RFID tracker, VizPick, MerchOne and Me@Walmart! Many of these have been recognized by Walmart and the industry for their contribution to innovation.

I'm now actively seeking Innovation, Experimentation, Design, Creative, Product & UX leadership roles. If you know of any opportunities or can connect me with someone who does, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm looking forward to bringing my expertise in ideation, research, prototyping and rapid acceleration to my next opportunity.

Above all, I am looking for an area that prioritizes empathy and kindness as their way of working. I would love to help build a culture of transparency and clear expectation that allows failing fast and learning faster to be the muscle behind the success.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"After 3 transformative years at Walmart, it‚Äôs time for me to welcome a new and exciting professional challenge (more on this to come!). 

I knew saying goodbye to the most talented, caring, and ambitious people I‚Äôve had the fortune to work with wouldn‚Äôt be easy. And it got even harder when, shortly after sharing my news, we learned that the majority of the design org would be impacted by Walmart‚Äôs RTO strategy. 

In the face of sudden change, we did what came naturally ‚Äî we got together over phone, zoom and chats. We spent the last few weeks connecting, strategizing, wondering, reminiscing, laughing, and shedding a few tears. Most of these folks I‚Äôve only met in person once or twice, a fact that has little to do with the quality of our human connection, or the groundbreaking work we deliver.

One common theme out of dozens of conversations was Gratitude. Gratitude for each other, our community, our impact (the agency and influence design has had at the world‚Äôs largest retailer is unreal!). It was a special era, and I‚Äôm grateful to have been a part of it.

To my Walmart colleagues that are staying, I hope that specialness continues on in a changed but no less meaningful form. You got this. For those that are moving on, I‚Äôm rooting for you! My virtual door is always open for you.

There are more people to thank than I‚Äôm allowed to tag, so I‚Äôll close with a special shout out to my teams. Together we scaled new heights and had a blast doing it. You are incredible and unstoppable, always!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"One of the biggest problems with trying to use generative AI today is that AI is only capable of generating things that ""look like"" other things. 

This morning I was creating a framework in Miro and I just needed an arc line to draw something. They didn't have that shape, so I asked their AI to draw me one... and got a very unexpected result. Why would Miro think that I would want it to draw me a whole flow chart?

I think this is reflective of a larger issue with AI in the industry: tools trying to make things that ""look like"" deliverables rather than things that facilitate the design process. 

It is an important distinction. I have a friend who was subcontracting for another consultant working on a design project. This consultant, I think, really believed in the power of generative AI, but there were other flaws in his thinking. For example, he wanted my friend to draw a Theory of Change diagram, but she didn't have enough context for the client and capabilities. It eventually became very clear that this consultant didn't think about a Theory of Change diagram as a part of the design PROCESS, but actually thought of it as a ""deliverable."" What he really wanted was something that ""looked like"" a Theory of Change diagram.

We see the same thing when the hottest AI tool uses Figma to draw an interface. What we're seeing isn't an interface design, it is something that ""Looks like"" an interface design. The design PROCESS isn't about producing something that looks like an interface and throwing it over the wall‚Äîwhen we draw things in Figma, we're creating centerpieces for conversations on a team. The team is full of brains that have context-specific knowledge, and the picture / diagram we're drawing is a way for us to synthesize that knowledge. 

I do draw a lot of flow charts, but Miro can't possible know what needs to be in my flow chart because usually I don't know. Flow charts are something that me and a team go back and forth on refining and refining‚Äîdiscovering questions and then tracking down answers, then updating the chart. When we get to the ""end,"" what we have is a composite of contextual knowledge that had probably never been synthesized before. 

It is just an odd thing. 

 
There might be a market for this. This consultant I mentioned might be happy with the outputs of AI generated things‚Äîbut I think that this is something holey different from the design process.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,AI/Machine Learning,infographic,Image,Monique,TeSalle,National Grid,Utilities,"Director, Product Design // Head of Design for U.S. Customer",2024-07-02 15:56,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206986782301696001,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQGDQyprF0REDw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1718111699734?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=yyqYdcnB4lhXN10Sf6m84_yYIAwFHP3M5IIErAHdwRA,,,genAI,,20,9,0,3w,,,,Monique TeSelle finds this insightful,Reaction,,2024-06-13 07:52,,,,,,,,,Thursday,11:52 AM,6/13/2024,Thursday,,Engagement,11-12pm,,,,,,29,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
https://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-teselle/recent-activity/reactions/,"After an incredible 9-year journey with Walmart, it's time for me to bid farewell and embark on a new adventure.
 
I joined Walmart in 2015 and have had the privilege of working in both Walmart Mexico and Central America, and Walmart USA. Throughout these years, I led diverse teams across eCommerce, Digital Factory (Zona 18), and spearheaded Mexico's digital transformation. My journey continued in the USA, where I took on multiple product roles focusing on Product Strategy, Supplier Experience, Item Catalog, Inventory Flow, and Store Innovation and Automation.
 
What other company in the world can provide such a broad range of experiences and opportunities for growth? Walmart has allowed me to develop a comprehensive skill set and gain invaluable insights across different facets of retail and technology. The size of Walmart, breadth and depth of experiences I've had here are unparalleled.
 
Throughout this journey, I've met the most amazing people who have each contributed to my growth as a person and a professional. The long tenures of Walmart employees have always impressed me the most and served as a source of inspiration. Sharing the floor with colleagues who have dedicated 20, 30, or even 40 years to this company has been a profound learning experience.
 
I leave Walmart with a bittersweet feeling. It‚Äôs not easy to say goodbye to a company I love, but also excited for the new chapter ahead for my career and my family. There are too many people to thank individually, but I want to give a special shout-out to those who have been particularly impactful in my journey.

THIS IS NOT NEW YORK: Generative Explorations of the Urban Landscape 

What AI dreams beyond the frame of my pictures?
In this personal exhibition, I have embarked on an exploratory journey, redefining the essence of what photography can be. This exploration begins with some pictures I took in New York and allows AI the space to imagine what lies beyond the frame of my original photo. 
This collection blurs the line between the tangible and the imagined in a process that transcends mere image production, venturing into a realm where the organic and the synthetic converge, and the known melds with the fantastical.¬† The AI serves as an augmentation of my artistic vision, amplifying my creative potential and propelling me into unexplored territories. It enables me to create images that challenge the viewer's expectations.

""This is not New York"" offers a glimpse into the future of artistic and photographic innovation, a tribute to the new frontiers accessible through the synergy of technology and human creativity.

EXHIBITION DETAILS
Title: THIS IS NOT NEW YORK: Generative Explorations of the Urban Landscape

It‚Äôs hard to believe it‚Äôs been 2 years since I started this journey, and I can still feel the excitement, inspiration and trepidation in taking on something seemingly monumental. Buckle up, they said.

I went all-in. I said Yes to every opportunity, I challenged myself, I got out of my comfort zone, I dug deep, I had big wins and and balancing setbacks, I persevered, I learned, and I transformed. üë©üèª‚Äçüéì

I explored my strengths as a systems thinker and a sensemaker, I leaned into my passion for community development, I expanded my reach, I developed lifelong friendships, and I defined my mission to make impact through climate solutions. üå±

I also learned that I might have missed my calling as a game show host.

The timing of this education was also magical. Being a student at MIT during the AI revolution was pretty special. AI will continue to transform our lives in ways that nobody fully understands yet, and we had a front seat for it. Seeing the transformation from a variety of perspectives and most importantly through intimate conversations with top leaders driving the vision, steering the evolution and adoption of the technology on a day-to-day basis and shaping the AI enabled world we all live in..  Definitely a highlight of this education. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

With the pace of change in the world today, coupled with the speed of technological advancement and unprecedented geopolitical instability, polarization and climate change, leadership is needed more than ever, and thoughtful leadership makes all the difference.

I‚Äôm most encouraged, excited and hopeful about the work I‚Äôve done to discover and develop my leadership signature, the uniqueness of my particular style, and for the safe environment in which I could take risks, test out some new ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô and bring all of it to bear in activating my vision.

I couldn‚Äôt possibly be more grateful. For the opportunity to build a community with this incredible group of people, and for the unwavering support of my friends and family. It has been amazing to expand my tribe and chart a course with you all.

And you‚Äôre amazing if you read this far! Brevity is not my strong suit, but I‚Äôm working on it!

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

The next policy move by the Federal Reserve is most likely a rate cut which will happen once central bank officials have a greater confidence level that inflation is returning in a persistent manner to the 2% target.

Together, we discussed one of our greatest enablers ‚Äì technology ‚Äì and how we can harness it to deliver more value for those we serve today, and for those we will serve in the future.

While reflecting on our strategy, our accomplishments and our areas of opportunity, I shared some words of advice I think apply to us all.

Always look for bright spots rather than flat spots. As humans, we are wired to look for the flat spots when something goes wrong. But if we switch our mindset to seek out the bright spots, we can delve into what is going well, learn from it and apply it to achieve even better outcomes in the future. By continuing to learn and share in service of our mission there is nothing we can‚Äôt accomplish together.

Many brilliant minds are working across technology, policy, and implementation. Proactive and thoughtful consideration of risks so safety, trust and transparency are at the forefront.

Interesting perspectives on the legislative work happening from Senator Klobachar (MN) and Senator Warren (VA) to consider safe guards and unintended uses.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpossley/,"Can generative image models be good world models?
This work from @Meta FAIR shows that there is a tradeoff between realism and diversity.
The more realistic a generative model becomes, the less diverse it becomes.
Realism comes at the cost of coverage.
In other words, the most realistic systems are mode-collapsed.

My hunch, supported by a growing amount of empirical evidence, is that world models should *not* be generative.
They should make predictions in representation space.
In representation space, unpredictable or otherwise irrelevant information is absent.
This is the main argument in favor of JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpossley/,"Glad to finally see Biden doing this. He can't out-Trump Trump on this front; just using all sticks with no carrots as immigration policy. I am all for clamping down on illegal immigration but we need to fix the legal immigration mess. Policy towards the spouses of citizens and legal immigrants has been outright cruel.

America is a land of immigrants and its economy totally depends on immigrants to keep growing. America has not had an employment problem for a long time. Its dependence on Filipino nurses is absolute, almost 35% of nurses in US are from Philippines. Its dependence on Indian American IT engineers is also fairly absolute. Same is true in agricultural sector where Mexican labor has become indispensable. 15% of the US population is foreign born. Close to 30% of the population has an immigration  connection.

While it stops illegal immigration, it needs to welcome much needed legal immigrants. With this announcement today, and the announcement of clamping down at border two weeks ago, President Biden has started to differentiate himself from DJT.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-deeringer-232a8b8/,"Before the month of May comes to a close, I want to share the story of my husband Ed.  His last 16 months of life did not come close to defining his immeasurable impact on the lives of so many but he fought everyday with every inch of his body, mind, soul and heart.  He fought past boundaries and limits he shared with me & long after what he defined as his dignity- all to spend every moment he could  with our girls and I.
Ed, like many glioblastoma patients was a picture of health. He exercised, relentlessly, scrutinized everything he ate. He was committed to a vegan diet. He pushed himself beyond his potential every single day of his life. That‚Äôs who Ed was. That is Ed‚Äôs legacy.
 In April 2022 Ed was diagnosed with a glioblastoma, but not just your average glioblastoma, his tumor was a diffuse midline glioma uncommon for someone his age. It was also unmethylated and had a lethal type of mutation- all things that excluded him from most if not all clinical trials.  He had his first surgery 4 days after his diagnosis on April 6. He woke up and recovered extremely well. Two weeks later on May 4 he started six weeks of radiation and chemo and we traveled to the city every five days a week for 6 weeks.  Ed had MRIs every 1-2 months depending on the findings. During that time, our family lived one moment at a time surviving MRI to MRI. It continued to start the doctors with his progress, with his determination and positivity. The doctors would always remark that he never  ‚Äúmatched‚Äù his imaging. However, in October 2022, just 6 months later, MRI showed a small suspicious spot with hydrocephalus, (fluid accumulating in his ventricles). He had a second brain surgery for the insertion of a VP shunt and a biopsy. He woke up with weakness to his right side, but after a couple of weeks was pretty much back to baseline and the biopsy showed good news -the number of active growing cells was low.  Until in March, he started having some back pain.  The cancer had spread to the membranes around his spinal cord- he was given 3-6 months to live.  Then he contracted shingles in his right eye and scalp.  Some of you may have seen the PSA he did in the hospital urging people to get their shingles vaccine.
On April 20th we made the decision to start hospice. When he was in hospice where we almost took him off because he was doing so well:  lifting weights & he signed up for the New York City marathon.  Our girls and I had the honor and privilege to love and care for our Ed until his last breath.  We never left his side as we walked him home.
I will never forget the conversations we had during those countless hours in waiting rooms.  He wanted to make things better for patients like him and families like ours.
So now I run and post for Ed.  I will be running the NYC marathon in November fundraising for National Brain Tumor Society
Please join me in spreading awareness and supporting this organization.

I am passionate about creating a better world for our children and grandchildren. What else should we leave behind, if not a flower for someone else to enjoy when we are gone?

Join me this week at the CMS Health Equity Conference to talk about using data and AI to improve health equity. While I am looking forward to presenting and facilitating conversation, I‚Äôm most excited about learning from other experts and colleagues on this topic.

To me, improving health equity means increasing the opportunity for someone to attain their optimal health - regardless of things like race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, geography or language.

Sometimes the best next step in creating the future you imagine is to take an objective look at where you are NOW (both as an organization and as an individual!) #HelloData Having a baseline is necessary to effectively measure change over time. How else will you know if you are actually moving in the right direction? How else will you have the confidence to change investments to better serve your mission?

Data can help us celebrate the ‚Äúwins‚Äù - reminding us where we started - highlighting how far we‚Äôve come. Data can also help us to stay grounded in how far we still have to go, so we can continue making the business case to invest in a purposeful pursuit.

However, just after completing her coursework and before turning in her final thesis, her then-boyfriend George Hislop, ‚Äô41, a GSE student in Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), got called in to serve during World War II, prompting the pair to get married and Virginia Hislop to leave campus before graduating. 

Now ‚Äì 83 years after leaving campus and living in service to learning ‚Äì Virginia Hislop returned to Stanford to finish what she started and receive her graduate degree. When she rose from her seat at the ceremony, donned in cap and gown, to walk across the stage and receive her master‚Äôs hood, the applause roared.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,"A CFO's Success Journey..

""I have been following the MECA CFO Academy program since 2016, and I would like to share my experience:

1. Compelling Content: I was initially drawn to the program by the compelling content shared by Mr. Saleem on LinkedIn. It was truly unique and informative.

2. Unique Format: The program‚Äôs format, spread over 12 months with multiple sessions, allowed me to better absorb the material over time, making the learning process more effective.

3. Community Support: The cohort and peer meetings created a strong sense of community. This aspect of the program provided me with additional motivation and support.

4. My Experience with the Program: My expectations were completely met. Having completed an MBA 15 years earlier, the refreshed content was particularly useful given my accumulated business experience.

5. Practical Application: At the time, I was a VP of Finance. The skills and techniques from the program significantly aided my strategic and financial endeavors.

6. Program Structure: The program was structured into three parts: strategy, leadership, and digital transformation. Each section was crucial for my development as a CFO.

7. Harvard Simulation and Case Studies: The Harvard simulation and case studies were pivotal. They offered practical applications of the learned techniques and brought the courses together cohesively.

8. Active Peer Group: The B13 peer group was very active, creating a safe environment for discussions and practice. This was incredibly beneficial for reinforcing and enhancing my learning.

9. Fully Remote Learning: The fully remote format with pre-uploaded lectures allowed me to thoroughly prepare before live discussions. This setup was very conducive to mature, interactive learning.

10. Why did I repeat the program: I repeated the program to reinforce my learning. The revamped digital content in later batches, especially given the progress in AI, was a major added value.

11. Career Advancement: When I joined, I was a VP of Finance at a smaller company. The strategic insights I gained from the course contributed to my promotion to CFO.

12. High Value Proposition: I highly recommend this program. It offers significant career advancement tools at a fraction of the cost of other top university programs, making it an excellent investment for anyone serious about their career in finance.""

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,"Corrosion of alloys in high temperature molten salts is often considered from the point of view of the alloy. A relatively less studied aspect, however, is the influence of the corrosion on the ""fouling"" of the molten salts themselves. In his recent publication (https://lnkd.in/eNnkyyv2), Kondaiah Paruchuri explores this subject in detail for molten nitrate, carbonate and chloride salts and shows that the corrosion resistant coatings developed at the Advanced Materials and Technologies Laboratory (https://amtl.me.vt.edu) not just mitigate corrosion of the alloys at high temperature but also reduce fouling, thereby preserving the properties of the molten salts better for thermal energy capture and storage.

I would be lying to say that I earned this recognition on my own, and it's only because of our team of talented engineers and technicians that I am even receiving this honor.

ASME (The American Society of Mechanical Engineers) is as old as the packaged steam boiler itself and was founded in response to the dangers of early designs and the need for pressure vessel standards.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,"My first experience with the devastating effects of climate change was the Cedar Rapids Flood of 2008. Almost 10% of the people in my hometown were displaced from their homes, and this flood caused 7x more damage because of climate change. 

Since then, it‚Äôs been my goal to contribute to the fight against climate change. Today, we have the chance to reduce suffering on a global scale, by acting now to minimize our greenhouse gas emissions.

This mission has taken me through the University of Iowa and University of California, Berkeley, where I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to begin tackling this immense challenge. During my PhD at Berkeley, my team at Berkeley Lab and I identified heavy industry as one of the most difficult sources of emissions to tackle, with huge potential for positive impact. 

During the next several years, we explored what it would take to decarbonize industrial process heat, which makes up 1/4 of all energy used in the world and accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions. We designed a thermal storage material and system that could provide this industrial heat at prices competitive with fossil fuels, and proved many of the critical features of this technology on a lab scale!

Our results were so promising that I decided to begin looking into what it would take to commercialize this, and bring the technology into the real world. This brought me to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Cradle to Commerce program, where I met Pauliina Meskanen.

Very quickly after meeting Pauliina, I knew this was somebody I wanted to work with. She has the determination, motivation, skills, and personality required to build a successful company from the ground up, and we decided to start working together almost exactly a year ago.

From these initial conversations, Calectra was born! Pauliina and I founded Calectra together with the mission to electrify and decarbonize industrial process heat. Since last May, we‚Äôve found that high-temperature industry (steel, cement, glass, chemicals, aluminum) is especially lacking in solutions for decarbonization. We are full steam ahead on filling this gap!

We‚Äôve got big plans, please follow along as we work to build Calectra and change the world!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-prasher-2458b41/,MISC,,Image,Ravi,Prasher,Bloom Energy,Utilities,Chief Technology Officer,2024-07-02 15:39,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211774471374786560,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D22AQFwP8yErsKuoQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1719418403430?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=drPGvQ8h9JhnzxGVjGoDtPaC48QJG8eSzosbEOUdcak,,,,,107,29,3,6d,Congratulations!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-anderson/,"When we designed the Jefferson Health Honickman Center, our new state-of-the-art outpatient care center, we knew we wanted to create much more than a traditional healthcare facility. We hoped to foster a true sense of #community, so we created an adjoining public plaza that could be activated for special events, fitness classes, and more. 
 
This week, at Jefferson Plaza, we hosted the #Jefferson200 Block Party in partnership with the city‚Äôs annual Wawa, Inc. Welcome America festival. It was a celebration of #innovation and #education as we recognized Jefferson‚Äôs rich 200-year legacy and commitment to Greater #Philadelphia. Live music, a DJ, free food, giveaways, #health resources, and a cornhole tournament for Jefferson staff, were some of the highlights. We even had an incredible performance by Philly‚Äôs own Kathy Sledge, a founding member of the iconic group Sister Sledge. 
 
The most meaningful part of the day was that our team kicked off the party with a service project to make 500 sandwiches for Our Brother‚Äôs Place shelter. Volunteerism has been a key part of our #bicentennial celebration as we‚Äôve committed to at least 200,000 hours of service in honor of 200 years. We‚Äôre half way toward that goal and we‚Äôre just getting started. 
 
Thanks to all who came out to what I hope is just one of many special moments on #JeffersonPlaza.

üîπ There's a lot of discussion about how AI can revolutionize education and healthcare worldwide. However, it's important to recognize the significant implications of AI in agriculture as well.

üî∏ While India has more than 20 official languages and a multitude of regional languages and dialects, AI holds immense potential for preserving and revitalizing endangered languages. This technology can be used to create language learning tools, analyze historical texts, and even generate new content in these languages.

üîπ Additionally, we explored how AI can help revolutionize spiritual content based on our rich cultural legacy and a vast collection of manuscripts. We also delved into the question of whether AI can truly help mankind, particularly in the realm of emotional or spiritual intelligence.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-cruz-66bb26a/,"One must remember that the talents that make a person successful in a previous, non-leadership role are rarely the same ones that will make them excel as leaders. This is why we have many companies grossly over-managed and severely under-led. When a leader can inspire and empower their team to become the very best version of themselves by challenging their assumptions of what they can accomplish, they can now empower their team to believe in the impossible and produce unimaginable results to the astonishment of many.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-cruz-66bb26a/,"According to Brian Scudamore, I've learned that strong leaders don't fight to have the¬†first¬†and last word. They listen to their teams, ask the right questions, and allow everyone to contribute. Instead of trying to do it all, find people who can do it better. With the right people in place, you can take a step back to focus on your strengths ‚Äì like leading your team and planning your company's future.

As Christine Cain indicated, to build a strong team, you must see someone else's strength as a complement to your weakness, not a threat to your position or authority. Great leaders aren't know-it-alls who continuously try to outshine everyone. They admit when they're wrong and genuinely want to learn from others.

At the end of the day, it's not about being the smartest person in the room. It's about building a team with the most intelligent people you can find and inspiring people to believe in the impossible.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertroley/,"Today we are announcing that we are the first observability platform to integrate with NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices). This announcement continues our strategy of extending our AI investment, and follows previous announcements of AI monitoring, New Relic (our GenAI Assistant), and AIOps.
 
Several organizations are rapidly adopting generative AI for a variety of use cases, and whether they are in experimentation, limited testing or full scale production, understanding how their AI investment is performing and returning value is critical. That is because running and deploying AI applications is costly and hard to get right. NIM helps this, but often LLMs are a part of the overall application, so New Relic allows you to observe all parts of the application, both AI and non-AI portions. Our investment in NVIDIA NIM allows customers to extend observability to NVIDIA‚Äôs microservices architecture.

Observability is uniquely suited to solving these challenges for business. This integration further reduces complexity and costs of developing, deploying, and monitoring AI applications. 

Customers can use New Relic AI monitoring to gain a comprehensive view of AI applications built with NVIDIA NIM, along with key metrics on throughput, latency, and costs while ensuring data privacy. 

I am proud that our team is always anticipating and solving for our customers' needs ahead of the market. And there is still so much more to come.

Congratulations to our 2024 cohort of incredible physician-leaders from all across the Houston Methodist system who graduated today from our Physician Leadership Development Program held in conjunction with Rice Business - Jones Graduate School of Business.

Over the past six months, they have had the invaluable opportunity to learn from both seasoned executives at Houston Methodist and distinguished professors at Rice University. This program was meticulously designed to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary for effective leadership.

Today, our physician leaders showcased their group projects addressing current priorities within our system. It was wonderful to observe how they applied their program learnings to devise practical solutions that will significantly impact our entire healthcare system.

A special thanks to all of the capable executive sponsors of our team projects @Wayne Voss, Roberta Schwartz, Sarah N Pletcher, MD  MHCDS, Shawn Tittle, janet leatherwood, and the thoughtful leadership of Carla Braxton MD, MBA,FACS, FACHE. I very much appreciate the partnership of Michael L. Koenig and Zoran Perunovic who were instrumental in the design and development of this unique learning experience.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertalschwartz/,"We had a packed house yesterday at Houston Methodist where we hosted American College of Healthcare Executives members from across the country for a curated Innovation Open House.  My colleagues and I presented on some of our key strategic initiatives including responsible AI use, patient access redesign, and ambient intelligence in the operating room. We then toured the group around our Tech Hub and Virtual Operations Command Center.

Here are some of the key messages shared from our leadership team:

Jordan Dale, System Chief Medical Information Officer - Whether you realize it or not, you probably use AI every day from spell check on your phone to navigating with Google Maps and much more. AI tools are an important part of our innovation strategy at Houston Methodist to continue leading medicine, and we are committed to using AI safely and responsibly with an AI oversight framework that ensures human agency remains a top priority.

Tesha Montgomery, Senior Vice President for System Access - Our health system serves a massive population with the footprint of Houston being larger than some entire states in the USA. In surveying our patients, convenience rises to the forefront with a majority of patients stating that they would switch providers due to convenience factors alone. With our digital front door committee and patient access team, we are constantly working to improve all new technology that is patient facing and are proud to share that almost half of new patient appointments are successfully scheduled online.

Evan D. Collins, MD, MBA, Chief of Hand & Upper Extremity Center, and Rose McCullough, Director - Implementing ambient intelligence tools in our operating rooms over the past 18 months has significantly improved our OR scheduling and efficiency.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertalschwartz/,"We had a packed house yesterday at Houston Methodist where we hosted American College of Healthcare Executives members from across the country for a curated Innovation Open House.  My colleagues and I presented on some of our key strategic initiatives including responsible AI use, patient access redesign, and ambient intelligence in the operating room. We then toured the group around our Tech Hub and Virtual Operations Command Center.

Here are some of the key messages shared from our leadership team:

Jordan Dale, System Chief Medical Information Officer - Whether you realize it or not, you probably use AI every day from spell check on your phone to navigating with Google Maps and much more. AI tools are an important part of our innovation strategy at Houston Methodist to continue leading medicine, and we are committed to using AI safely and responsibly with an AI oversight framework that ensures human agency remains a top priority.

Tesha Montgomery, Senior Vice President for System Access - Our health system serves a massive population with the footprint of Houston being larger than some entire states in the USA. In surveying our patients, convenience rises to the forefront with a majority of patients stating that they would switch providers due to convenience factors alone. With our digital front door committee and patient access team, we are constantly working to improve all new technology that is patient facing and are proud to share that almost half of new patient appointments are successfully scheduled online.

Evan D. Collins, MD, MBA, Chief of Hand & Upper Extremity Center, and Rose McCullough, Director - Implementing ambient intelligence tools in our operating rooms over the past 18 months has significantly improved our OR scheduling and efficiency. In collaboration with our vendor, we have been able to make the technology work specifically for our needs at Houston Methodist.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/romena-akhter-0583015/,"PE firms are recognizing the CIO's role in driving revenue, cost efficiency, and AI strategy ‚Äì all critical for success. This elevates the CIO from a tactical leader to a strategic partner. Investors are increasingly looking for strong CIOs at PE-backed firms. This means the CIO profile becomes a key consideration during portfolio company selection. The PE focus on long-term value creation aligns perfectly with the strategic capabilities of a forward-thinking CIO. Building for the future requires strong technology leadership.

We need to identify CIOs who understand the PE landscape and can contribute to the firm's investment strategies. When placing CIOs, we must emphasize their strategic impact beyond just IT operations.

Sarah helped promote and bring her #residents together for this event in support of Mayor Yemi‚Äôs initiative (Ik #Neighborhood Gatherings) to combat #loneliness! 

This event was sponsored by Zonzon and SERVPRO and it was beautiful to see residents come together, enjoy some Einstein‚Äôs Bagels and Krispy Kreme Donuts, and make meaningful connections. 

Together, we‚Äôre stronger!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkpark/,"Managing more than 60 hotels from upstate New York all the way down to Georgia, Visions Hotels has established a benchmark for exemplary guest experience on the East Coast.

In 2019, Visions partnered with Otelier (formerly MDO) to deploy a business intelligence solution that would automate back-office reporting and centralize performance data from across its portfolio, allowing leadership unique insight to build data-driven strategies. Today, general managers, accounting teams, and corporate leaders spend less time on manual data entry and back-office tasks, freeing them up to focus on driving guest satisfaction.

""The spike in inflation over the past couple years means profitability doesn‚Äôt flow the same way it once did. So, it‚Äôs important for our team members at the property level and corporate to always be hyper aware of our daily performance,‚Äù says Jason D'Agostino, Corporate Director of Revenue Management at Visions Hotels. ""IntelliSight has been crucial for our team members who rely on automated dashboards each morning, showing rooms sold, GSS scores, rate-shopping data, our STAR reports, all in one spot.""

A few of the highlights:
- Meeting Dudley White was an unexpected source of inspiration, as he was in very high demand. I appreciate that he took the time to engage in conversation.
- Meeting Darryl Hoelscher in person. We collaborated for two years on a program for a major bank through video conferences. I knew Darryl was great before everyone else at Signature got to work with him! üòÅ

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcurran1/,"Allow me to reintroduce myself üî•

I‚Äôm Valissa and I guide mid-career women and women of color who aspire to stand out and ascend to executive leadership--without overworking.

- I spent over 15 years navigating and leading teams in financial services and technology which are male-dominated spaces.

- After overcoming career challenges to reach executive roles, I realized in 2020 that supporting women with their career aspirations is my PURPOSE.

- So, I started Standout Career Guide to help mid-career women and women of color advance their careers and worked full-time until I resigned in May 2023.

- In January 2024,¬†¬†I pursued full-time entrepreneurship focused on personal brand and leadership coaching.

Fast forward to today...

- In 1:1, group, speaking, and masterclass settings, I lead women through transformative coaching that aligns with their ambitions.

I‚Äôm proud to see many clients achieve their dreams of becoming influential leaders within their companies and industries.

Client salary increases total $145K so far.

They:

üìà Elevate their visibility and leadership brand
üí∞ Gain recognition and achieve promotions
üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Excel without overworking or sacrificing their well-being

ALL with integrity, relationships, and focus.

Coaching and a community of supportive professionals make a HUGE difference, especially in spaces with limited leadership diversity.

Also, I'm a proud wife, bonus Mom, soon-to-be author, travel lover, rom-com movie enthusiast, foodie, avid learner, and personality assessments fan.

My mission?

Every day I jump from bed, I'm excited to champion the advancement of corporate women in leadership roles with salaries that match their contributions. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I know you want that, too.

Join me tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon EST via Zoom for a free hands-on masterclass, ‚ÄúBuild Your Strategic Network Blueprint: Securing An Executive Role & Salary Growth‚Äù üöÄ

Nicor Gas‚Äô commitment to philanthropy and volunteerism is at the heart of everything we do. Yet, it's the strength of our partnerships with organizations like the Northern Illinois Food Bank, United Way of Metro Chicago, The Salvation Army, The Morton Arboretum, Quad County Urban League and many others that amplifies our impact, weaving together a stronger, more extensive network to serve our customers and foster regional growth. 

As I reflect on the achievements highlighted in this report, I‚Äôm filled with gratitude for the hard work and generosity of our team.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,"My friend and neighbor is going solar. I should be celebrating this, as it puts us one step closer to energy independence and giving climate change a big kick in the pants. Unfortunately, my joy is dampened somewhat by the ever-worsening business practices within our industry.

I don't work in residential solar anymore but I can humblebrag and say I know my way around the industry pretty well after 20+ years in it and even if I had to brush up on the current net metering regs... I've got a good idea how this all works. Having said that, trying to read his ""proposal"" took me an embarassing little while, largely because so much of it is complete nonsense. I still don't fully understand what my friend has signed up for (and he CERTAINLY doesn't) but here are some things I noticed.
1. The array of financing parties involved is completely absurd. On this one document, I see reference to LGCY Power, Sunrun, and Lux Power. The added bonus is that the project is apparently actually being financed by et another party, who I won't name here. None of those folks are the actual installer, who is yet another party added to the mix. Man, as a consultant, I *am* a soft cost in the solar industry but this seems ridiculous.
2. Their generation estimate is high, which doesn't surprise me (or likely any of you) but it's high by more than I would like to see (>10%) because they didn't look at shading... for a house in the woods. Sigh.
3. When I visited my friend, he had solar on the roof already but, as far as he knew, he had not yet signed a contract. I'm not even sure where to start with that but he believed the contractor had filed for a permit, so I'm still trying to understand just what my friend has done to himself on this one.
4. The system is 10-20% oversized vs. annual load and my friend is not planning any big load increases. I am sure this was done to maximize someone's incentive because it certainly is not optimal for the homeowner. Luckily, for now, Eversource's net metering rate is pretty generous but if that changes a signficant fraction of his generation may be valued below his payment to his financing company. They also are running around with laminated ""news articles"" about ISO-NE $2.4bn investment in new infrastructure and implying that will all be fully rate based to residential customers.

5. The fear-mongering sales tactics are crazy. They claim utility costs are going up 10% per year (more like 4%-7% in reality, depending on if you look over the past 20 years or past 5 years) and that in 25 years my friend is going to have a $5k+/month electric bill. This makes their 3.5% annual increase seem darn reasonable...

At the end of the day, my friend will save something by going solar... because solar is a fundamentally effective and inexpensive technology. Unfortunately, he will pay (no joke) 4x more for it than he should have and it is down to these predatory sales practices and overly complex financing structures.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,MISC,,Text,Sander,Cohan,National Grid,Utilities,"Head, Innovation",2024-07-02 15:57,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7210301131648831488,,,,,,69,30,1,1w,,,,Sander Cohan likes this,Likes,,2024-06-22 11:22,,,,,,,,,Saturday,3:22 PM,6/22/2024,Saturday,,Engagement,3-4pm,,,,,,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Innovation, collaboration, and diverse thinking are central to achieving this.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,"Friends and Colleagues
I am very excited to be able to share that after a tremendous run serving as CEO of Ava Community Energy that I will be joining Octopus Energy Group, where I will work to grow their many clean energy tentacles across North America. 

A few years ago, I started trying to better understand who the best in class, customer obsessed, clean energy companies were so that Ava could shamelessly copy their best ideas. After lots of time spent reading reports, talking to people across the industry and directly engaging the many great and fascinating companies, I came across Octopus Energy. They were doing everything I wanted to do at Ava. 

Building a brand that people really care about - in an industry where people don't know or care about the brand. Octopus has become THE most trusted brand in energy across the UK with Trustpilot scores head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. 

Scaling load flexibility to levels where it actually matters and plays a meaningful role in electricity resource planning - with over 200k EVs and more than a GW of total load under control OE operates the largest VPP in the world. 

Designing technology solutions that fix the underlying 'wiring' issues in utility/CCA operations that make delivering incredible customer service and innovative electrification solutions so difficult - the Kraken suite of products serve over 50m utility meters globally and managing over 30GWs of clean energy.

So when the opportunity presented itself to join the Octopus team and work to bring these capabilities across the pond I was really really intrigued. I also knew that the Ava team was fully ready to take over and continue to overperform. 

Now that my journey at Ava has come to an end, I am ready to take on this amazing, fun and audacious new challenge - to partner with electric utilities across North America to help them drastically scale the delivery clean, affordable and reliable electricity. 

I look forward to catching up with many of you in the very near future. I will continue to be based in San Francisco, CA so if you find yourself in the city by the bay, lets catch up.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,MISC,,Celebration,Sander,Cohan,National Grid,Utilities,"Head, Innovation",2024-07-02 15:57,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208939393481359360,https://media.licdn.com/media/AAYQAQQSAAgAAQAAAAAAABgBrZ2daanMQJ-egBdqUfzcNg.gif,,,,,881,131,3,2w,Congrats Nick!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandercohan/,"What makes an innovative organisation? It's more than just actions, over words. It's in their willingness to take chances, in their courage to experiment, and in their constant state of curiosity. 

They see challenges as opportunities. Continuously improving, evolving and refusing to accept how they work today, as how they want to work tomorrow.

It's in their hunt for humility, an open arms approach to learning, the abolition of ego, and the warmth, respect and veracious hunger for the input of others.

Innovation cultures are forged from diverse and inclusive engagements involving unusual suspects. A melting pot of combustible people and materials that meet in sometimes bizarre and serendipitous ways to spark unexpected yet powerful reactions. It's a mindset, and it's in the DNA of the organisation, the particles and bonds, the synaptic connections, how they fuse and branch.

Innovative organisations are melting pots of divergent minds. They celebrate the value of difference. A little bit of the past, a pinch of the present, and a heavy hit of the future. Drucker was right when he said culture eats strategy for breakfast Paul. One could argue it eats it for lunch and dinner too.

For National Grid to have deployed Ideaonomy AI as part of their inaugural innovation day, a start up less than a year old, to a host of senior stakeholders speaks volumes.  We're proud to work with clients who have guts. Without guts, there will be no change. We can't play it safe and still expect to win.

Big thanks Ben, David, Sander, Chris, Gerard, Linda, Caroline, Oli, Phillipa, Sarah, Mark, Jonathan, Paula, Nora, Stephen, Matthew.

Without this expertise, we can end up spending days or even weeks training a machine learning model. The book I recently read, ""Accelerate Model Training with PyTorch 2.X"" by Maicon Melo Alves, fills that gap, offering insights that can significantly speed up our work.

What I really appreciated was the book's practical, hands-on approach with copious code examples and experimental evaluations.

I appreciate Vinishka Kalra for making time to send me a copy of this book. Thank you!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanpdoherty/,"After an incredible 35 years at EY, I am excited to let the LinkedIn world know that I will be retiring at the end of this week. There are too many acknowledgements to include all the great colleagues, clients, and friends I have worked with and learned from over the years in this post. However, I would like to take this moment to show my appreciation for Aaron Hipscher who left this earth way too soon and showed an incredible amount of confidence in me that I never would have found in myself. He took a chance on hiring me initially into the firm saying he knew this SUNY Binghamton kid from the Bronx had untapped potential. During the interview process, he insisted that I stop by the Arthur Young office after I had a 2nd interview with every other firm to check in with him. Aaron‚Äôs tremendous recruiting skills were evident when I landed in Vero Beach on September 11th, 1989, for 2 weeks of audit training. Thanks to him I was lucky enough to start my career with an amazing group of people that continue to be fantastic friends to this day.

During my 35 years at EY, there were times I got antsy and considered leaving. However, each time the power of mentoring helped redirect me to an interesting project or opportunity within EY where I was able to leverage the tremendous insight I had learned from auditing some of the most innovative derivative trading companies early in my career.  These experiences included two adventure filled overseas secondments to Tokyo, Japan.

Starting my next chapter, I am excited to share my experiences and insights with my Financial Statement Analysis students at Fordham University next semester. I am hoping I can sway some of them to enter the exciting world of Public Accounting. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I will just have to play Ben Affleck‚Äôs Accountant 2 in class when it is released!! In addition to teaching, I am excited to consider taking on some board positions to leverage my deep experience working with Japanese and US financial institutions as well as Private Equity clients throughout my career.

I feel so grateful for all the incredible experiences and relationships I‚Äôve cultivated during my time at EY. I have worked with some of our largest Banking and Private Equity clients and so many talented and amazing people. Thank you to everyone I have worked with for all of your support over the years.

This program is specifically designed to support women who have experienced trauma to help them heal and move forward in their lives. Trauma can have a profound impact on a person's life, and it is essential to confront and address it in order to overcome its effects.

I am incredibly proud to share that twelve courageous women successfully completed the program and shared their powerful stories during the graduation ceremony. It was truly inspiring to witness their strength and resilience.

I was also privileged to have my dear friend, Retired Federal Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore, as our guest speaker. Her speech was nothing short of amazing, filled with valuable lessons and words of encouragement. Her presence added an extra layer of significance to the event.

Reflecting on this journey, I am overwhelmed with gratitude. It is truly humbling to witness the positive impact our program has had on the lives of these women, and I am grateful to be a part of their healing process.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/shachella-james-pmp-69b8a1b/,MISC,,Image,Shachella,James,CenterPoint Energy,Utilities,Vice President Infrastructure and Technology Services at CenterPoint Energy,2024-07-02 15:41,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204665330055405568,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQHfhv7LMsbvNw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1717720590496?e=1723075200&v=beta&t=vZy0179xWqfGgq4KQpZar-7hZg47FUvt_ypof1DZGj0,,,,,57,12,0,3w,,,,"Shachella James, PMP likes this",Likes,,2024-06-06 22:07,,,,,,,,,Friday,2:07 AM,6/7/2024,Friday,,Engagement,2-3am,,,,,,69,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-lloyd-35b26218/,"I am glad to see that the recent Peterson Health Technology Institute (PHTI) report on virtual MSK care aligns with the broader body of evidence supporting the efficacy of virtual physical therapy. However, I am disappointed that several studies used to support the efficacy of ‚ÄúPT-guided‚Äù care do not mention the involvement of a physical therapist in the intervention. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and every state practice act make it clear that one must be licensed to practice physical therapy to call their services physical therapy whether that care is delivered virtually or in-person. Grouping non-PT interventions under ‚ÄúPT-guided care‚Äù weakens a report that otherwise delivers an accurate assessment of the opportunity for virtual physical therapy to deliver value in MSK care.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-lloyd-35b26218/,"#PhysiciansAtHLTH

HLTH takes place every October in Vegas, and will take place this year on Oct 20th - 23rd.

For the last few years, I've created schedules and guides for physicians attending HLTH.  I'm a fan of these conferences because they focus on emerging healthcare technology, serve as a great way to network with physicians who have interesting non-clinical jobs, and feature a ""who's who"" speaker and panel lineup of leaders from hospitals, tech companies, and policy groups.

During prior conferences, physicians have been under-represented largely due to the cost of the event and because CME is not included.  However, both of these are going to change:
üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è HLTH has a new ""Physicians at HLTH"" track and they will be offering CME for some of the talks this year (https://lnkd.in/gJCDncND).
üí≤ Additionally, HLTH and Nisha Mehta, MD's Physician Side Gigs are going to be offering free admission for 200 physicians.  (more info here: https://lnkd.in/g_XaV_Yn and application here: https://lnkd.in/gKs7z5wZ)

So far, only a few speakers have been announced (Tom Mihaljevic, CEO of Cleveland Clinic and Joaquin Duato, CEO of Johnson & Johnson).  HLTH will also feature pitch competitions, American Medical Association's Physician Innovation Network events, StartUp Health company talks by physician founders, companies like Zus Health that are requesting physician feedback, and great parties üéâ.

Here is a link to a ""A Physicians Guide to HLTH"" I wrote about a past event (https://lnkd.in/dMzdb9X3).  I also included an the HLTH23 calendar, and I'll be making an HLTH24 calendar once more speakers and events are announced.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-lloyd-35b26218/,MISC,,Image,Stacy,Lloyd,American Medical Association,Healthcare Providers,"Director, Digital Health & Operations",2024-07-01 17:28,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204879141219778560,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFu2Vk-G-VvYg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1717346502543?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=X4VaE3Rm_Fh4z7XLW2M6RiQQHH1_xF-5AM9bufwLu4Y,,,,,64,17,1,4w,,,,Stacy Lloyd likes this,Likes,,2024-06-07 16:17,,,,,,,,,Friday,8:17 PM,6/7/2024,Friday,,Engagement,8-9pm,,,,,,82,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Last week I had the privilege of hosting a discussion on ""unleashing health data"" at the World Economic Forum's Global Technology Retreat. As we think about harnessing the power of GenAI and LLMs to improve the way we care for people, we identified the need for aligned incentives to drive transformative change; clear statements of sustainable ROI for all stakeholders, including patients and communities; robust public-private partnerships; and high impact case studies to show in practice that we must do more than simply be content with these powerful new tools nibbling around the edges of a broken healthcare system.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mastephen/,"I have been applying to many internships for almost 9 months now and I have a couple of resumes based on the role. But at times, there is some specific technology that the job description mentions, which I have worked on but didn‚Äôt add to my resume to avoid cluttering. At times, I also edit certain points based on the role. And while I store the multiple versions of my resume on my laptop, I like to keep the naming consistent and avoid the terms (2), copy, etc. However, I often have to create multiple folders to track which resume I submit for a particular company. This takes around 10-20 seconds for every application, and if I am submitting my resume with major edits for multiple roles, that takes some additional time. So, I built a short script in Python (I like to call it a mini-project!) to save some time for me. The way it works is - when I make the edits and download my resume, I ensure it is in the following format -FirstNameLastName_Resume_RoleName_Company. This script will create a folder based on the company name and then create a sub-folder for a specific role within the company, all while keeping the file name consistent (FirstNameLastName_Resume.pdf).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-romano-23b3b974/,"Let's recap what appears to be complete BS against Trump. The man wins an election against an unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton
. They pay for a fake dossier and claim it's not the American people who elected him but the Russians. A Special Counsel is appointed, millions of dollars are spent, and the conclusion is that there was never any collusion between Trump and the Russians. It was the American people who elected him. It was complete BS.

Once in the White House, a woman writes a memoir and claims Trump sexually assaulted her several decades ago. Trump says no, I never did what she is accusing me of. New York then changes the law so she could bring charges decades after. She's actually unable to provide any direct evidence because she waited decades to report the alleged assault. The case proceeds anyway; eventually, after back and forth, Trump has to pay her millions of dollars for defamation. In interviews, she says she can't wait to receive the money so that she can go shopping worldwide. She also says the sexual assault was never sexual; claims rape is sexy. The media ignores the inconsistencies because that's not what the so-called deep state wants.

A porn actress also comes out and says she had an affair with Trump decades ago, and Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. The government says, wow! That's such huge information, had the American people known that they would have elected Clinton. Several people say there's no case to be made there; eventually, the case goes to court with the government claiming that he did not specifically disclose that the legal fee was somehow a campaign contribution. Anyway, they convict Trump. Meanwhile, the porn industry exploits all these women and men, paying them only a small fee once to shoot their movies and using them for decades without ever paying them any other fee. One would think a government that cares about porn actresses would try to help them and stop the exploitation. No, they actually don't care.

I can go on and on. When junior journalists receive information from the government in the form of indictments, they often believe everything the government says, that they are just there trying to punish deadly criminals in society, that they are trying to stop a dangerous guy. Meanwhile, the so-called dangerous man has not done all the atrocities others have done in terms of laws that punish ordinary people, including some based on their race, and bombs all over the world that left hundreds of thousands of people dead. Of course, Trump is not a perfect man. People attack him; he also attacks people, and so do you.

But the false claim that he's the worst American to have ever lived and that now he's akin to Adolf Hitler and if he's re-elected again, doom and gloom would envelop the United States are simply false. Now they are claiming that he's so crazy he might attack Biden on stage on June 27 when they debate in Atlanta next week. The hypocrisy is really disgusting.

It reminded me of the first time I met Carla when she was also on stage, talking about Morgan Stanley's newly launched incubator and its mission to empower underrepresented founders. I got so inspired, asked two questions in public, and chased after her as she was leaving to see how I could join her team. Who would have known, Carla took a chance on me, and because of that, I had three years of the most meaningful career helping scale that program and support our founders.

As I have just graduated from Harvard Business School, I want to thank all the mentors and ex-colleagues like Carla who helped me, trusted me, and inspired me. Without you, I wouldn't have been here.

Thank you to our partners, Kate Crosby and Peter Light for having us, and for making this project a reality through their vision and leadership.

The Eversource Energy and ABRSD project team designed and built this school through the Mass Save Path 1: Net Zero and Low EUI Buildings program, with an Energy Use Intensity (EUI) goal of 23.1 ‚Äì which is well below the Massachusetts school median score of 65. The Boardwalk Campus building surpassed that EUI target and has been operating for over a year at less than a third of the energy use per square foot of a typical Massachusetts school. It is a remarkable achievement, and this building can now serve as a statewide and national model for decarbonization and high-performance energy efficiency.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilaksubrahmanian/,"Did you happen to notice a minor adjustment to the setting on your Wi-Fi thermostat last week? It‚Äôs what we call ‚ÄúDemand Response‚Äù in the wonky and technical energy community. On hot humid days like we‚Äôve been having, demand on the electric grid is significant. For those signed up for our ConnectedSolutions demand response program, small adjustments are made to the thermostat for a couple of hours to reduce demand on the grid. 

Last week Amy Findlay, P.E. and her team were hard at work overseeing this choreography. The chart below shows what happened on Thursday, when along with utilities across New England, we were able to drop the peak by 300 MW during the three-hour peak energy event timeframe ‚Äì equivalent to powering approximately 200,000 homes. Amy and her team are already delivering on the vision for Virtual Power Plants.

Tune in to https://lnkd.in/dvknQiDw to listen to the entire podcast.

The overall message was meant to be positive, with Velshi noting that in 2023, 30% of the electricity generated came from clean energy sources such as hydro, wind, and solar (such as our recent solar project at Northeastern University‚Äôs landmark Snell Library building which welcomes more than two million visitors per year). This is about halfway to the world‚Äôs goal of reaching 60% by 2030.

However, a concerning point that emerged from the podcast, which seemed to be overlooked by the commentators, was the 2% increase in global electricity consumption. This is a stark reminder that to limit the rise in the world's average surface temperature to no more than 1.5 degrees C; we must urgently lower energy use, not increase it.

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has identified lowering energy use through efficiency as a crucial pathway to limiting global warming. The International Energy Agency reports that energy efficiency could cut today‚Äôs energy bills in advanced countries by one-third and make up 50% of the CO2 reductions needed by 2030 to achieve global climate targets.

I make an effort to read every book that comes along on leadership as well as make a conscious effort to view the perspectives of others. I am focused on helping others to assimilate and create an amazing outcome for a business. STOP with the negative behavior and hierarchy! If you are in leadership and do not understand the criticality of mental health - you will fail to reach your team. I constantly hear complaints about ""Folks want more money"" - Did you know that they would take less just to be treated differently? As someone that cares so deeply about my work that I would go through weekends, nights et al. if only to feel appreciated, 79% more than a promotion.

Al Kenney for 20+ years of friendship and for being my bridge to SAP. Peter T. Brandt for bringing me in to SAP and for helping me get started on this journey. Joerg Koesters for wearing every hat possible with me for the last 17+ years ‚Äì coach, collaborator, manager, peer, advocate, co-conspirator and, most of all, great friend. Franz Josef Schoppengerd for your early mentorship, years of industry collaboration, continued friendship, and more than a few memorable meals along the way. Ram Jambunathan for your years of mentorship and inspiration, along with Alexa Gorman, Paul White, Max Kahn, Lior Weizman and the entire SAP.iO team for helping to contribute so much amazing innovation opportunity to Consumer Industries. Jeffrey Harvey for your relentless optimism and can-do spirit through thick and thin.¬†And, finally, E.J. Kenney, Matt Laukaitis, and Lori Mitchell-Keller for your leadership, example, coaching and advocacy.¬†I would not have had the career I‚Äôve had at SAP without your encouragement, support and sponsorship.

Wishing all of my SAP colleagues all the best for continued success going forward.  As for me, I don‚Äôt yet know what's next but I‚Äôm excited to find out.¬†For now, I plan to take a little time off to recharge and reassess and then looking forward to seeing what the future holds!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonybender/,MISC,post,Text,Tony,Bender,Culligan,Consumer & Industrial Products,Global CIO,2024-07-01 16:36,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7202174145822953472,,,,,,212,137,0,1mo,Congrats on a great run Mark!

Yes, it is the best Father‚Äôs Day gift I‚Äôve ever gotten. But not for the reason you think.

As parents, Neil and I tell the kids they can be anything they want; that no dream is impossible. And that no one succeeds alone.

How extraordinary when you can show your kids that what you‚Äôre telling them is true.

I feel so grateful to have been part of this team, where everything worked because everyone worked together. From the lighting, sound, and scenic design, to the costumes, wigs and makeup; from the story, score and orchestrations, to the cast, crew and choreography. With an outstanding team of producers and a director who brought a brilliant vision and - with genius and generosity - let her team do its best work to bring that vision to life.

I feel humbled to have been in the company of our fellow nominees, each of whom illuminated the human experience through their art.

Thank you and congratulations to The Araca Group, Matthew Rego, Michael Rego, Hank Unger and Cristina V., to my friends Sue Gilad and Larry Rogowsky, to American Zoetrope, Angelina Jolie, all of our co-producers, the team at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, our brilliant director Danya Taymor and the amazing cast, crew and creatives who take us, every night, to Tulsa, 1967.

I feel so grateful to my parents, who always let me be me; and my husband, Neil, who always catches me.

And to my wonderful kids, who fill me with wonder and remind me that anything‚Äôs possible:

Ignore the people who tell you, you shouldn‚Äôt. Tune out the voices that tell you, you couldn‚Äôt.
Embrace those who tell you, you should, could and will. And, as Kecia Lewis said last night:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracyburzycki/,"When our daughter Mrinalini was born, we decided to raise her in India during her school years. 

Once when she was six, we were at Delhi airport waiting to board.¬†I noticed her speaking in a whispered voice, concentrating intensely, eyes closed.¬†I asked her later what she'd been up to.¬†She became shy. ""Papa, I was sending a message to my school teacher.""

""If you cannot write a letter,  there is another way to send a thought over. You send it to God who then sends it across to the person.¬†I wanted her to know that I love her and am looking forward to seeing her again in school soon.""

When she was seven, we enrolled her in a summer athletics cubs camp at Columbia. Walking around campus, seeing the statue of Columbia‚Äôs beloved mascot, the lion, she announced, ‚ÄúI will go to college here when I grow up.‚Äù 

I smiled. ‚ÄúMrinalini, let time take its course. There are many good colleges, and I am sure one of them is going to be just the right one for you.‚Äù Who could say what the future held in store?

She frowned fiercely, as if to tell me, just because I am seven and you‚Äôre a bit older does not mean that you don‚Äôt take what I know about my destiny seriously.

When she was nine, I noticed her getting very stretched across multiple projects. I thought it was time to sit her down and offer her some adult wisdom. ‚ÄúMrinalini, as you grow, you‚Äôll see that you can‚Äôt do everything, or learn everything, or be everything. You‚Äôll have to make some hard choices.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeonardo de Vinci didn‚Äôt have to make hard choices,‚Äù she replied.

Never swaying for a moment in her plan for college, 8 years later, she got early admission to Columbia. 

Then last week, Mrinalini Sisodia Wadhwa graduated.¬†As Columbia College‚Äôs Salutatorian, she was given the honor of sitting next to the College Dean on stage. She double-majored in history and mathematics & won departmental honors in both fields & a history thesis award. At Columbia, she learned French, Sanskrit and Urdu, was the co-editor-in-chief of the Columbia Undergraduate Law Journal and chair of the Columbia History Association, and co-founded the Columbia Asia Journal. She will now study as a US Rhodes Scholar at University of Oxford. 

At her graduation dinner, I shared her passion for art and poetry. The way she used two corks and three toothpicks to make a giraffe when she was seven, and a poem she wrote on Africa when she was sixteen at a Bostwana safari. I should have also shared her love for knitting, and Odissi, and her daily meditation.

Every child has the seed of something magical in them. All we can do, as parents and caregivers, is to water that seedling and watch it bloom into the radiant flower they were each uniquely meant to be. Because, as India‚Äôs poet laureate Tagore wrote, ‚ÄúEvery child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man.‚Äù

Congratulations to the Class of 2024 around the world, and a big ""thank you"" to all school and college educators!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicki-kuo-033658/,"LinkedIn family,

It's been a while, so thank you for allowing me a moment to share some updates via a very long post. I‚Äôm eager to reconnect and hear from you as well.

Reflecting on my 25-year journey in cybersecurity, I'm grateful for the people, experiences, and milestones that have enriched my professional life. From shaping go-to-market strategies for emerging cybersecurity companies to achieving a number of strategic exits, each experience has been a blessing.

As an immigrant displaced by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the boundless opportunities in America profoundly influenced my work ethic and values. The legacy of dedication and resilience instilled by my father, who served with the US Department of Defense, and my mother's bravery which helped us escape a war torn country, continues to inspire my commitment to the cybersecurity and defense sectors.

A career highlight was my tenure at Proofpoint, where we as a team grew the company from $20 million to $1.4 billion in annual recurring revenue over 13.5 years, from early-stage to IPO, and later acquisition by Thoma Bravo. I'm thankful for the friendships forged and lessons learned.

Along the way, I developed an obsession with the US venture capital ecosystem and how it consistently generates the world's most significant companies. Starting with pre-IPO investments in Facebook and Palantir I went on to invest in and help over 100 innovative startups over the last 15 years. This path eventually led me to launch my own VC fund called Inflection Ventures in December of 2022.

At Inflection Ventures, we focus on private companies in cybersecurity, defense, and technology infrastructure, primarily looking for growth stage companies (at their point of inflection) but also supporting and advising friends in the ecosystem across all stages.

These photos are from a visit with Shield AI in Dallas, where I met with cofounder and CEO Ryan Tseng. Shield AI leads in developing AI systems for defense applications, enhancing autonomous decision-making in critical missions where GPS and communications are compromised. Their mission aligns perfectly with our goals, and represents the impactful work we support.

Please message me if you want to catch up or learn more. I'd love to hear your voice. 

I appreciate all of you and am extremely grateful to all the LPs on this journey with us!

All the best, 
Kabe

https://www.linkedin.com/in/willruble/,"Many claim to be data-driven, but most focus solely on revenue, a lagging indicator of past performance. By the time revenue drops, it's too late to take corrective action.

Being truly data-driven means identifying and influencing the inputs to revenue, known as driver metrics or KPIs. The key to making this happen is the Weekly Metrics Review meeting, my favorite and most impactful ritual of the week.

Weekly Metrics Meeting goes over:
(a) All of the driver metrics that¬†lead¬†to revenue,
(b) voiced over by the directly responsible individuals that own them,
(c) on a weekly basis.

I‚Äôve seen the transformative effect this ritual has had on my teams at SurveyMonkey, Miro, Amplitude, and now at Dropbox: everyone is on the same page and tracking the same metrics. No more data drift. No more misalignment. No more distrust in data. This one meeting allows the team to focus on executing in the same direction.

-> To get started, begin by identifying the driver metrics. This means building a bottom-up forecast model (i.e. actual math formula) to connect these metrics to output revenue.
These usually include sign ups, free to paid conversion, churn rate, etc.

-> Then, understand which driver metrics need to change/lift to achieve the desired revenue scenario. These become your assumptions.

-> The Weekly Metrics Review meeting focuses only on the driver metrics with assumptions against them.

-> Lastly, identify the people who will own each metric, coordinating activities across departments to drive the desired lift.

-> Go over these metrics with all DRIs on a weekly basis.

Trust me, it's a game changer once you perfect it.

More details on how to make it happen on my blog: https://lnkd.in/eg36Ud2p

It symbolized guidance and forward momentum in both my personal and professional life. The arrow reminded me of the beauty in growth and change, encouraging us to step out of our comfort zones, take the path less traveled, and trust the journey.

I'm thrilled to announce the next chapter in my professional journey as I join Wells Fargo as a Technology Executive in the Identity Access Management space!

My decision to join Wells Fargo reflects their iconic logo ‚Äì the stagecoach journeying towards the new frontier of the West. This symbolizes new beginnings and endless possibilities for me. This imagery serendipitously aligns with my own journey towards growth and new horizons, acting as a declaration of growth inspired by my recent reflections.

Thank you again to everyone who has supported me along the way. Here‚Äôs to the journey ahead, to the paths we choose, and to the arrows and stagecoaches that guide us.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/yar-savchenko-6a973723/,MISC,,Image,Yar,Savchenko,Comerica Bank,Banking,Senior Vice President of Infrastructure,2024-07-01 15:54,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7202345820237553664,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQERmvPIGAfQTQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1717109448833?e=1722470400&v=beta&t=-BGO1topQzXB6INtHI6aWBvDtHBf1s5kwFaA1jBo7Zc,,,,,209,75,0,1mo,,,,Yar Savchenko likes this,Likes,,2024-05-31 16:30,,,,,,,,,Friday,8:30 PM,5/31/2024,Friday,,Engagement,8-9pm,,,,,,284,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
