"Earlier this week, Greg Engel, Brad Brown and I hosted a dinner in New York City with some of our clients, journalists and industry influencers to discuss the findings from our latest KPMG Tax Reimagined 2023: Perspectives from the C-suite report.
The data spurred some really interesting conversations on corporate tax departments â€“ including their role as value drivers to the broader business, the impact of AI and how to grapple with the rising importance of the intersection of Tax and ESG, and the skillsets and talent needed in the tax department of the future.

"Iâ€™m delighted to announce that Cognizant has agreed to acquire Mobica, an IoT software engineering services provider headquartered in the UK. Mobicaâ€™s services span the software development cycle, with core competencies in implementation, testing, and the deployment of embedded software, and a specialization in clientsâ€™ strategic internal R&D projects. This acquisition significantly expands Cognizantâ€™s IoT-embedded software engineering capabilities and will enable us to provide clients with a deeper and broader array of end-to-end support to enable digital transformation. Mobica builds upon Cognizant's efforts to establish strategic capabilities in Eastern Europe through our earlier acquisitions of Softvision and Devbridge, which have significant software product engineering operations in Romania and Lithuania, respectively. Upon acquiring Mobica, Cognizant will have more than 7,500 associates in Eastern Europe.",
"The most courageous act in modern business history may be the decision by CVS Health nearly a decade ago to quit selling cigarettes.
In what seemed like the blink of an eye, CVS walked away from $2 billion in revenue and hundreds of millions in profit.
Remarkably, when CVS quit selling cigarettes, many Americans who relied on CVS as their supplier quit smoking altogether.
The move coincided with the companyâ€™s shift into more direct provisioning of healthcare servicesâ€”and sent a strong message to employees and external stakeholders that CVS was truly in the business of health.
As more and more retailers (Walgreens, Amazon, Costco Wholesale) and tech companies (Apple, Facebook, and Google) have gotten into the business of healthcare, not enough companies are struggling with the ethical consequences of simultaneously selling products and services that erode health while also selling healthcare services.
In my latest Forbes column, I describe the tension and a few ways that companies work work to resolve it.",

"I was in Washington, DC, this week with eBay sellers to meet with congressional leaders and senators about raising the 1099-K tax reporting threshold far above the current $600 level. We know that many entrepreneurs begin their journey by selling something they already own, because they believe it could have a second (or third) life on eBay. This could include their grandmotherâ€™s china, a vintage bicycle, or a preloved handbag. In each of these cases, they likely didnâ€™t make taxable income and the original receipt is long gone. Now is not the time to create barriers for people who want to sell items online - and I left my conversations feeling optimistic about progress weâ€™re making on this topic. A bipartisan, permanent fix will remove confusion and concern for millions of people, and weâ€™ll continue to advocate for our sellers on this critical issue.",

"Much has been made of clinician shortages. It is a societal problem of great significanceâ€”that will require bigger fixes linke increasing the number of medical school and residency slots and potentially implementing new technologies to augment clinical capacity. However, I always struggle when an individual organization (particularly those in attractive high density metropolitan areas) struggles with shortages. What a single organization needs to do when presented with a *national* shortage is simply be a better employer than the next organization. It needs to create better working conditions and be a more attractive employer than the next organization. And the reality is that the working conditions and morale in many clinical organizations have deteriorated to the point where having a good work cultureâ€”where people feel empowered and valued and respected (simple as that sounds) can be a differentiator. And while the macro environment may be challenged with shortagesâ€”individual groups and institutions can be fine because they do the work to create a working environment that feels soulfully and personally rewarding for individuals.",

"Engaged employees arenâ€™t immune to negativity or job stress. Our insights reveal that whether they're engaged or not, employees experience more stress during the workweek than on the weekend.
So, how should managers structure the ideal day for employees to encourage higher engagement and performance? It begins by providing meaningful feedback and recognizing employeesâ€™ strengths.
Performance management fails when managers treat feedback like itâ€™s a balancing act. Itâ€™s not about equally matching criticism with praise â€“ instead, itâ€™s about ensuring the scales are heavily tilted toward what employees do best.

"So Friday 8th Sept marked my last day as CEO of International, and if you are reading this, donâ€™t worryâ€”itâ€™s not an Oscar Speech. ðŸ˜Š
Although Iâ€™ll be with Walmart until the end of January, when I officially retire, that Friday was a day to reflect and remember what an extraordinary journey the last 27 years have been and in particular the last 6 years in International. It was a day to be grateful.
Iâ€™ve had opportunities to meet people, see places and hear stories that I never thought I would possibly be able to do, or in fact, that I could have imagined. Of everything, it is the stories that leave the biggest impression on me. Everyone at Walmart, all 2.1 million of us, have a story. They can be heartbreaking, inspiring, funny, sad, and sometimes all of those at once, but itâ€™s what makes us unique. And the thing I have loved most about what I have done, is hearing the stories of people all over the world. Theyâ€™ve given me energy every day to keep working towards making things better in ways large and small.
From Asda in the UK for 17 years, to leading our stores in Walmart US, to Walmart International, my experiences have reinforced my deeply held belief that we are more common than we are different wherever we are and that â€˜our people make the differenceâ€™ has never been more true.
Thank you to everyone who commented on Dougâ€™s post. Itâ€™s been humbling (to say the least), and Iâ€™m at a loss for words (which doesnâ€™t happen often!) on how to express how I feel when I read them.

I always look to learn from others, and I shared three tips for making the most of these opportunities:
- Be intellectually curious â€“ People like to talk about what they do.
- Be respectful â€“ Ask open-ended questions that allow someone to
share their perspective.
- Be authentic â€“ Be yourself. Donâ€™t try to be a person you think
others want you to be.
When we are authentic, respectful and intellectually curious, youâ€™ll be surprised how open people are to helping us.

"Fantastic article by Jim Campbell, AvidXchange, Inc.â€™s Construction Business Line Executive, about how AP automation can strengthen key relationships in the construction industry. Cash flow is king in the construction business, especially for subcontractors and smaller companies that are buying materials earlier than ever before due to ongoing supply chain problems. The right AP automation solution streamlines invoicing and payment, reducing the collective burden for general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers.

"We had a solid second quarter at Pfizer, and our financial results were in line with our expectations. We are more than halfway to our goal of launching 19 new products or indications in an 18-month span across a variety of therapeutic areas. Most importantly, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines in the first six months of 2023.
Patients are the reason we exist, and we never forget that the work we do is to help them.
- We continue our integration planning with Seagen and recently announced a new oncology R&D structure that we believe will help further accelerate our delivery of cancer therapiesâ€”because we know that when it comes to the battle against cancer: time is life.
- We are building on our acquisitions of Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics to help deliver solutions for immuno-inflammatory diseases, RSV, migraine, and sickle cell disease, respectively.
- We know that trust is everything and recently received great accolades from U.S. News & World Report and Newsweek. For the third year in a row, we also earned a top 100 score in the 2023 â€œDisability Equality Index.â€

"In celebration of the start of Black History Month, today I would like to lend my platform to the â€œGodfather of Silicon Valleyâ€ â€” Roy Clay Sr.
In 1958, Clay was writing software for the U.S. Department of Energy when word of his instrumental work got back to David Packard of the Hewlett-Packard Company. Shortly thereafter, Clay was recruited to establish HPâ€™s computer development program, ultimately writing software for the HP 2116A, the first computer sold by the company. As the highest-ranking Black HP employee for a time, he used his position to help the company improve its efforts to combat discrimination and inequities. I make this introduction because Black history matters, and now you know the story of this influential technologist and can share it with others.
In honor of Black History Month, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Black Employee Network will host a series of celebrations. I look forward to participating and would like to thank them for their continued effort to advance how we all can act as a force for good.
