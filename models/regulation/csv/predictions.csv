"This week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a set of rules aimed at bringing about greater transparency, competition, and efficiency in the $25 trillion market for private funds.
The new rules apply to private equity, venture capital, and hedge fund managers "" asset classes that conjure up images of Wall Street and Silicon Valley. But in reality, this market is fueled by millions of American teachers, firefighters, and other public servants.
More than 5,000 public pension funds collectively manage $5.6 trillion in retirement savings for nearly 27 million Americans. These pension plans are major investors across these asset classes, and in particular are the largest block of investors in private equity.
As such, millions of Americans' retirement security is increasingly tied to a private funds market that has grown rapidly -- but has remained opaque and structurally biased to favor the interests of Wall Street private fund managers over those of middle-class retirement savers and pensioners.
At Omidyar Network, we believe the new SEC rules are a win for retirement savers, and a meaningful step towards a private funds industry that is more competitive, efficient, transparent and accountable.

"We expect to see a boom in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing as a result of the CHIPS Act, but a new announcement from the U.S. Commerce Department means we may also see a boom in available childcare. In order to tap into $40 billion in federal subsidies, manufacturers will need to guarantee affordable, high-quality childcare for workers.
As a father, a husband, and an American, I am elated. As a technology leader, I am cautiously optimistic. Not only should this requirement help curb the labor shortage companies are facing, but it will also further meet the needs of workers with children. In theory, that's a win-win.
Companies that receive subsidies can work with the Commerce Department to ensure they are meeting basic guidelines for the care provided to workers, which could include childcare centers near the plants themselves or directing a portion of subsidy funds to workers to pay for care for their children.
Whether manufacturers manage to check all the right boxes for childcare in the midst of racing to build new factories and ramp up production remains to be seen. My hope is, they will. Nevertheless, this serves as a step forward in empowering American workers in a way that *should* benefit workers, the tech industry, and the overall economy.
