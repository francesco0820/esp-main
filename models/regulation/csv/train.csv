"So Friday 8th Sept marked my last day as CEO of International, and if you are reading this, don't worry""it's not an Oscar Speech. Y S
Although I'll be with Walmart until the end of January, when I officially retire, that Friday was a day to reflect and remember what an extraordinary journey the last 27 years have been and in particular the last 6 years in International. It was a day to be grateful.
I've had opportunities to meet people, see places and hear stories that I never thought I would possibly be able to do, or in fact, that I could have imagined. Of everything, it is the stories that leave the biggest impression on me. Everyone at Walmart, all 2.1 million of us, have a story. They can be heartbreaking, inspiring, funny, sad, and sometimes all of those at once, but it's what makes us unique. And the thing I have loved most about what I have done, is hearing the stories of people all over the world. They've given me energy every day to keep working towards making things better in ways large and small.
From Asda in the UK for 17 years, to leading our stores in Walmart US, to Walmart International, my experiences have reinforced my deeply held belief that we are more common than we are different wherever we are and that "" our people make the difference' has never been more true.
Thank you to everyone who commented on Doug's post. It's been humbling (to say the least), and I'm at a loss for words (which doesn't happen often!) on how to express how I feel when I read them.
I'll keep posting on LinkedIn as I embark on my next chapter, whatever that may hold, and I'll end for now with a simple thank you to everyone who has guided me, shaped me, challenged me and taken a chance on me and the brilliant teams I've had the honor of working with over all these years.

"Much has been made of clinician shortages. It is a societal problem of great significance""that will require bigger fixes linke increasing the number of medical school and residency slots and potentially implementing new technologies to augment clinical capacity. However, I always struggle when an individual organization (particularly those in attractive high density metropolitan areas) struggles with shortages. What a single organization needs to do when presented with a *national* shortage is simply be a better employer than the next organization. It needs to create better working conditions and be a more attractive employer than the next organization. And the reality is that the working conditions and morale in many clinical organizations have deteriorated to the point where having a good work culture""where people feel empowered and valued and respected (simple as that sounds) can be a differentiator.

"Today, the European Commission has published proposals to reform the legislation that regulates medicines in the European Union. The proposals have important goals: increasing patient access to medicines across Europe and strengthening the competitiveness of Europe's pharmaceutical sector. I share these goals: I have worked towards them for over 30 years, and as a European company, Novo Nordisk has done so for a century. Unfortunately, in their current form I fear that these proposals will have the opposite effect.
There is no doubt that reform is needed "" and soon. We have to stimulate research in new treatments to tackle serious chronic diseases, as well as anti-microbial resistance and other emerging health threats. The reform is a huge undertaking and has many positive points for improving the speed and efficiency of the EU's regulatory system. However, the Commission has got some of the big calls wrong. To continue to #innovate, big and small companies need a #regulatory framework that incentivises science and innovation, ensures that top talent and research facilities stay in Europe and takes intellectual property seriously. But the Commission is proposing to reduce the baseline of an essential form of intellectual property, so-called Regulatory Data Protection, from eight years to only six years. The Commission then proposes additional protection periods, on fulfilling certain conditions. These are unpredictable, which results in uncertainty when making investment decisions on developing medicines, which may only bear fruit a decade later. In the case of a requirement to launch a medicine in all 27 EU member states, this is simply impossible to comply with, because of how national health systems decide on how medicines are put on the market. Together, these measures would reduce our ability to develop new medicines in Europe, while failing to increase access in practice.
However, I am committed to engaging on this legislation, and we all have a responsibility to work together to ensure the revised pharmaceutical legislation can meet the complementary needs of patients, healthcare systems and a competitive and resilient economy across Europe. This is an important focus in my incoming role as President of EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. If we work together and get it right, we can create an environment that inspires and supports innovation, competitiveness and patient health, making Europe stronger for the decades to come.

"Just recently, Stanford University released its AI Index Report for this year.
The most interesting points from my perspective:
- Companies that are already using AI are benefiting significantly (e.g. cost decreases and revenue increases)
- AI is both helping and harming the environment (e.g. it makes processes more energy efficient, but also requires energy itself)
- The number of incidents concerning the misuse of AI is rapidly rising (e.g. deepfakes)
- Interest in AI is increasing, not least among politicians and legislators
For me, the development and use of AI solutions go hand in hand with responsibility. This means, for example, thinking about sustainability when developing AI solutions, and focusing on the benefits for - and safety of - the people using it.
Achieving this requires a careful balance between enabling technological process and establishing rules based on common values. After all, AI opens up a new way of doing business with entirely new business models. It can help make businesses more agile, supply chains more resilient, and economies more sustainable.
I would like to see Europe focus on these opportunities. By overregulating out of fear of the potential risks, we also face the very real possibility of losing startups and investors, for example.
In addition to the existing regulations that apply already, the upcoming EU AI Act should only regulate AI applications that pose significant risk to the health, safety, and fundamental rights of citizens. I hope that the vote in the European Parliament will not deviate from a risk-based approach.
Finally, I would like to encourage governments to agree on global principles and standards for the use of safe and trustworthy AI. Ultimately, the biggest risk would be to stifle opportunities before they can blossom.",Regulation or Legislation

"The novelty of AI makes it feel like we're entering uncharted territory. But are we?
The technology sure is new, which is what makes it so promising "" and so concerning "" for healthcare. As noted in this week's The New York Times piece, AI's widespread application and ability to continuously learn also mean that we must take a different approach to regulation.
But the gravity of this moment is familiar. It's what we felt when the internet began connecting our computers "" and when electricity started lighting our homes. As I wrote in my book on misinformation in healthcare, ""Dead Wrong,"" we must draw lessons from how governments regulated innovations of the past to inform how we oversee new frontiers in technology, medicine, and media.
So what can we learn from our past about AI's regulatory future?
Ys Settling for lax or no regulations is the wrong move.
That's what we did with social media. That may explain why one study found that on pre-Elon Twitter, misinformation traveled 6 times faster than the truth, and bogus news stories were 70% more likely to be retweeted.
As Jesse Ehrenfeld MD MPH of the American Medical Association told the Times, doctors need to know we can trust AI before it can make a meaningful difference in healthcare.
Y Regulators must listen to *all* the groups who may feel the effects of rules governing AI.
When I was researching ""Dead Wrong,"" my team spoke with Sachin H. Jain, MD, MBA and Aneesh Chopra, who helped drive the implementation of Meaningful Use under the HITECH Act, and they both made this point. If we had sought out and listened to more on-the-ground physicians, we might have preserved the joy of medicine.
AI stands to change the lives of nearly everyone who touches the healthcare system. That means regulators need open and ongoing conversations with people beyond technology vendors.
Y Smart, agile, adept regulation requires a forward-thinking, results-driven approach.
Meaningful Use was about the transition from paper to electronic health records. But what about the interoperability required to move and use that data for the benefit of patients? That was beyond our scope, and it caused problems that continue today.
President Biden's executive order is an encouraging start, but AI's unique nature will likely require lawmakers to take action. We'll need smart regulations that align the technology's development not only to the challenges we face today, but also our aspirations for tomorrow.
If we build a regulatory framework with that in mind, AI may well improve care and curb misinformation. It will be much harder to retrofit poorly designed regulations to those goals after the fact.

"In celebration of the start of Black History Month, today I would like to lend my platform to the ""Godfather of Silicon Valley"" "" Roy Clay Sr.
In 1958, Clay was writing software for the U.S. Department of Energy when word of his instrumental work got back to David Packard of the Hewlett-Packard Company. Shortly thereafter, Clay was recruited to establish HP's computer development program, ultimately writing software for the HP 2116A, the first computer sold by the company. As the highest-ranking Black HP employee for a time, he used his position to help the company improve its efforts to combat discrimination and inequities. I make this introduction because Black history matters, and now you know the story of this influential technologist and can share it with others.
In honor of Black History Month, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Black Employee Network will host a series of celebrations. I look forward to participating and would like to thank them for their continued effort to advance how we all can act as a force for good.

"AI regulation is clearly coming. The EU already has multiple drafts in process. And it is one of very few topics Democrats and Republicans can agree upon. The challenge of course is that no one can clearly articulate what the regulations should achieve, let alone what rules could enable or prevent those outcomes.
In an effort to embrace the reality and try to shape the debate, OpenAI gave testimony in the Senate last week and just issued a blog post advocating for an international agency similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency. I am glad they and the tech industry more broadly are leaning in.
From a politics perspective, this was a smart move and made last week's hearing much friendlier than it could have been. From a policy perspective, it is hard to tell yet. The proposal acknowledges the global nature of the risks and the issues. Today's blog post provided more detail, including distinctions between smaller open source models and experiments vs large models. Given the pace of progress on open source, it is not clear how meaningful this distinction is or will remain. But OpenAI's proposal is certainly better than some more specific suggestions like assigning punitive liability to hosting companies or requiring regulatory review of every code release or individual attributes of models - or defaulting to forcing everything through a privacy regulatory lens, which while very important for social media may not be a top three regulatory issue for AI.
I personally think the most productive regulatory effort would actually be to clarify where and how existing laws apply. For example, what does copyright mean in the context of AI? Does Drake have rights to an AI model trained on his songs? What constitutes fair use? How about privacy and data security laws? Non-discrimination laws ? Product safety regulations and product liability rules? Reducing uncertainty in the application of existing laws and regulations could go a long way toward producing fair outcomes and retaining trust in the ability of political and legal systems to keep up with rapid technological change.",Regulation or Legislation

"This is HUGE- at the White House today for the signing of an unprecedented executive order that includes more than 50 (FIFTY!!) directives to expand access and provide support for child care and long-term care workers.

Too many families and individuals struggle to access the affordable, high-quality care they need. According to our latest survey, less than half of employed active-duty spouse respondents were able to find child care.

In fact, ""child care is too expensive"" is the top reason given by active-duty spouse respondents who are not currently working but need or want to work. For those who care about food insecurity in military families (I'm looking at you, Craig Newmark!) this is a piece of the solution.

"Check out this excellent report from Tyler Gellasch and Alex Thornton at Center for American Progress making the case for why the SEC and Congress should take action to bring more sunlight, transparency and accountability to private markets - and articulating and why this matters to Americans as investors, workers and shoppers, and is critical to the health of our capital markets and the American economy.
I'd pull out three key points:
1. ""The overwhelming majority of Americans are now exposed, either directly or indirectly, to the hidden risks of the private markets."" This is particularly notable for the teachers, firefighters and manufacturing sector workers whose retirement savings are invested in private markets via their pension funds. But it's also relevant to all Americans - as we all are impacted by the meteoric growth of large private companies (""unicorns"") and the $14 trillion private funds market.
2. ""All investors clearly benefit from the comprehensive, consistent, reliable, and comparable information"" ... but ""Whereas information in the public markets is fairly accessible to all market participants, access to information in private markets often depends on who is buying and selling.... private markets are built on discrimination"" U.S. private markets are opaque, and the embodiment of an uneven, unfair playing field. That runs contrary to the SEC's mandate of protecting investors and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets
3. ""The exposure of millions of American families and businesses to markets that lack the disclosure and accountability protections of the public markets should ring loud alarm bells, not just for regulators and investors but for anyone who cares about the integrity and prosperity of America's capital markets. The SEC has the authority to begin addressing this growing problem. The agency should act quickly to do so and work with Congress"" on solutions.

Now is not the time to create barriers for people who want to sell items online - and I left my conversations feeling optimistic about progress we're making on this topic. A bipartisan, permanent fix will remove confusion and concern for millions of people, and we'll continue to advocate for our sellers on this critical issue.",

"The dynamic developments in the #GenerativeAI space have made it very clear that we urgently need international rules and guidelines for AI. This is a belief shared by politicians, scientists, developers, and users alike. Governments and companies worldwide have the responsibility to minimize risks.
While Europe is well-positioned to take on a pioneering role in this area with the EU AI Act, one critical question remains: The development and implementation of AI regulation takes a long time "" and in the light of the fast-paced developments in this area, time is something we don't have. So how can we bridge this gap?
The answer lies in self-regulation. At SAP, we were one of the first European companies to define #AIEthics guiding principles and created an AI ethics steering committee in 2018. We also assembled an advisory panel of external experts from academia, politics, and industry to help us chart our course and monitor our approach. And back in January 2022, we rolled out the SAP Global AI Ethics Policy to clarify how SAP's ethical guiding principles are applied to our daily work.
As companies accelerate their adoption of AI technology, it is crucial to commit to ethical practices and self-regulation until comprehensive international AI regulations are put into place. By doing so, we can ensure a safer, fairer, and more #responsible AI-driven future for all. And experiences gathered by doing so could also provide useful input for governments when preparing actual AI legislation that is fit for purpose.",Regulation or Legislation

Thousands of Sage customers are already benefiting from AI solutions and services. We are excited about the possibilities of this next wave of generative AI and believe it will elevate the work of humans, freeing them up from repetitive administration tasks and allowing them to contribute through higher-value tasks, ultimately increasing productivity.
The UK, and London specifically, with its vibrant tech ecosystem, rich history of innovation and diverse talent pool, is an ideal location to discuss the future of AI.
PM Sunak's emphasis on ensuring the safe and secure development of AI resonates with our values at Sage. Ethical AI development is not just good for business; it is essential for humanity.
The UK must take a leadership role in supporting international alignment on AI regulation. Hosting an organisation for global cooperation on AI based in London could be instrumental to this.

"The biggest news in AI this week was the new White House Executive Order. This is a balanced and accessible summary by one of the best tech/platform analysts. We will be watching closely as the implications are unpacked by the business, policy and academic communities. In the mean time, I have a few high level comments:
(1) It is true that regulation sometimes can have unintended consequences. And the US has generally benefited from a light regulatory agenda in enabling new technology innovation. But it does seem like the stakes are sufficiently high that some oversight - balanced with appropriate humility about how much is not yet known - is in order. I don't share the ""must avoid any regulation for this rapidly evolving space"" view of some folks in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, or the cynical view that this is just regulatory capture by some early movers in AI.
(2) It is an executive order and doesn't carry the weight or permanence of a law passed by Congress. With that said, it is definitely not nothing. As Casey notes, it has significant breadth and depth. The model size thresholds will allow smaller/open source players to avoid much of the scrutiny the operators of the largest proprietary models will be subject to. Seems like a reasonable approach, even though it is hard to know if they drew the line in the right place, and the line will need to be revisited over time.
(3) While the US have briefly taken the regulatory initiative here, I expect the EU will reclaim it soon - and with more teeth, less concern for throttling innovation and a desire to support/favor an emerging AI industry in Europe.
(4) The executive order does not address some of the bigger commercial issues related to copyright and fair use. Negotiations are already under way between major rights holders and platforms, and I expect that can be solved without much government intervention. The big issue will be smaller individual rights holders.
(5) The content/media authenticity/deep fake issue is moving so fast I worry it could overwhelm democratic processes. We already saw deep fakes affect the recent election in Slovakia, and as the President noted, it is now trivial to create synthetic media that (almost) perfectly impersonates anyone. I hope the Commerce Dept plans to work closely with industry to develop watermarking and other standards.
At DocuSign, we believe AI will transform how agreements are created, negotiated, executed and managed. As the leader in both e-signature and contract lifecycle management, we are benefitting from years of experience in developing AI functionality, a deep understanding of agreements and a position of trust with our customers.
