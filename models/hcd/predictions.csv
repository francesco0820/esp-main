"Every day at Leaf Home our marketing, sales and field teams  are in touch with thousands of homeowners who are looking to learn more about the products and services we provide. We strive to deliver a seamless and exceptional customer experience and our online Self-Scheduler is the latest example of this commitment.   We now  allow homeowners to schedule home visits  for estimates in a few quick clicks through our web experience. YTM Simple but powerful because previously, the process involved speaking with up to three separate people Y  , which could be frustrating and time-consuming for busy homeowners.  This improvement is not only  good for our customers, but it also benefits our business. We see a higher number of appointments, lower cancellation rates and higher sell-through rates when homeowners are setting up their own appointments. Y Leveraging this tool has also freed up time for our team from calendaring tasks, creating a true win-win from both a customer experience and operational efficiency standpoint.  Launched as an A/B test and now being rolled out to all our users, this is the outcome of a  phenomenal partnership between our Growth Product, Technology and Transformation teams Brian Swedenberg Phil Newlon Jeremy Hough Samantha Albarran Y Giving more power to the customer is at the heart of building a great hashtag#d2c business and we are always looking for new digital ideas to test that simplify and elevate the hashtag#customerexperience in the home services space.Y If you have an idea, we would love to hear from you.",Human-Centered Design,1,1

"Yesterday, we were honored to perform the Maile Lei Untying Ceremony with Hawaiian Electric for our Kapolei Energy Storage facility in West Oahu.  Community engagement and safety are paramount to us at Plus Power, and we were grateful for the participation of many state and local officials and community stakeholders to help us celebrate.This 185 MW / 565 MWh facility, relying on 158 Tesla Megapack 2's, is the largest demonstration in the world of grid-forming services from a standalone battery storage facility. It is committed to provide 50 MW of Fast Frequency Response, virtual inertia, and blackstart services akin to a conventional power plant""but in 250 milliseconds and without emissions or need of water. We are thrilled to work with  Hawaiian Electric on this landmark facility that will help hashtag#Hawaii meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045.  This groundbreaking project is a postcard from the future: Batteries will soon be providing these services, at scale, on the mainland. Representing approximately 17% of Oahu's peak load, KES will be operated by Hawaiian Electric to help balance the  island's  power  grid, enabling the continued growth of both rooftop solar and utility-scale renewable energy.

"One of Procter & Gamble's strategic priorities is to lead with deep consumer insights, which help us deliver breakthrough innovations and superior products that better peoples everyday lives. 

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry loads carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now Tide Cold Certified  meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well  or even better  in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. Its a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And were proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tides ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

"I got the best compliment from a client today. She said...""You're like a superfood. Nutrient rich. You pack a big punch. Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question. Pierce denial. Pierce lies. Pierce the surface.hashtag#emotionalintelligencehashtag#purposehashtag#iqeqtqThis picture is a fair representation of how I look when I receive compliments. A lot happy.
