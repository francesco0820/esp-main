Check out this video showing a newly designed hinge developed by Carter Worthen, a lead operations specialist in our Gas Distribution Operations in Utah, after he witnessed a coworker sustain an injury from a falling bin door.
 
The hinge is designed to prevent potential injuries by preventing bin doors from inadvertently opening on our trucks. Once our Safety and Fleet Maintenance team completes its testing, the hinges will be installed throughout our Gas Distribution fleet. These hinges can also be used for our trucks on the electric side – and potentially help our industry peers too!","Innovation,Human-centered design,Product Development",

"A few years ago, while getting ready for bed on a Thanksgiving night, my father fell and fractured his hip. I drove to meet him in the emergency room, where the young woman at the front desk looked up at me and said, blandly, “You must be here to see Room 4.” I was actually there to see my dad, but resisted the opportunity to make that a teachable moment and headed to room 4. When I walked in, the nurse was standing with her hand on my dad’s shoulder. She greeted me warmly and started sharing “what a cool guy” my father is, that he must be in a lot of pain but has been joking and making her laugh, that he’s been telling her about being with the family for Thanksgiving and even about my work in healthcare.

The Glasgow Consensus Statement – published last week and available at https://lnkd.in/ebr7dJXu – focuses on reinforcing the humanity in healthcare. The primary overarching task is to Connect as Humans. That’s the difference between ‘room 4’ and ‘what a cool guy’. Human connection is essential, not extra. And it benefits patients, families, and health professionals – I hope we can all rally around that.","Customer centricity,Human-centered design",checked
"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"6 months ago, I shared my new role as the President and Co-Founder of Vale Health. Today, a lot of work from countless people allowed us to announce the first health system going live with their wellness marketplace. https://lnkd.in/gNEVh7yE 

As you will see, we started with better sleep as a health goal. We believe we are the first to really combine evidence-based wellness products, apps, and education with direct links to the clinical services of high quality health care providers into one experience. Now, people can have a trusted wellness marketplace linked to their trusted provider for their total health and wellness needs. 

Many more person-centered goals and categories are coming soon. You will also see the launch of the other founding health systems this year. 

These are still early days, and we know there is a lot to learn still, but I do want to pause today and thank the many people and organizations that came together to get us to the first milestone.

"â“RAG demos are easy. RAG in production is much harder. Why is it so?Recently I wrote about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the technique that enables enterprises to leverage the power of large language models (link in comment ).Many companies have experienced that their technology teams are able to demonstrate the use of RAG quite rapidly. However, when the time comes to put the solution into production, they face difficulties. The users do not accept the solution easily and many donâ€™t think it adds a lot of value.We will first see why the demos are easy and then reflect on the challenge of productionising RAG.Why are RAG demos easy?ðŸ‘‰ Simple architecture: The principle of RAG is quite simple to understand. In the basic RAG pipeline, there are very few components: vector database, source chunking, vector matching and LLM interface. It is easy for engineers to understand the architecture.ðŸ‘‰ Framework availability: To make matters simpler, helper frameworks such as Langchain and LlamaIndex are available. They come with built-in support for chunking, vector databases and LLMs. It is possible to build an RAG pipeline by writing a few lines of code, if you are using one of these frameworks. The initial results of such a pipeline are very impressive, mainly because of the language abilities of the LLMs. Thus great demonstrations can be built quickly with RAG. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»Now we will see why using RAG in production is challenging. ðŸ‘‰ Correct but not comprehensive: For simpler questions, the replies are often satisfactory. However, when complex questions are asked, the users find the answers correct, but not satisfactory. They feel that the reply covers only basic aspects, but not what they really needed.ðŸ‘‰ Source requirements: In order that RAG works, the necessary knowledge sources should be added to the vector index. It takes a lot of effort to judge the requirements of users and accordingly build the index. It does not stop here. The index must be forever updated with current information.ðŸ‘‰ Easy to add, difficult to remove: Once a source is added to the index, it starts influencing the answers. Many times, multiple sources contain conflicting information (for example, old and new price list). The answers in this case become unreliable.ðŸ‘‰ Data privacy: The quick RAG implementations typically use an external LLM api such as OpenAI or Google. In such cases, the internal data of an organization is sent to the outside world; creating a possibility of data privacy issues.ðŸ‘‰ Latency: As the index size grows, it takes a long time to select the right material for a query. This is unacceptable for real time use.Overcoming these challenges involves building a more complex pipeline. I will describe that in a later post, but here are some techniques that can help: reranking, knowledge graph, internal models, trust layers.hashtag#llm hashtag#retrievalaugmentedgeneration hashtag#aiinbusiness","Data and Analytics,Innovation,Human-centered design",checked
"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
📈 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
🖥 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
🏥 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
⌚ With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another.

"Users prefer to learn by doing. Not by reading instructions. Every extra word is an opportunity for users to abandon the product. They have more important stuff to do.This is where intuitive design come into play.Let's break it down: 1. Intuitive Navigation: Design your interface in a way that feels natural to the user. Familiar patterns, like swipe to refresh or pinch to zoom, are more effective than instructions. 2. Visual Cues: Use icons, colors, and visual hierarchy to guide users. A well-placed arrow or a different button color can direct users more efficiently than text. Make sure that the design is also aesthetically pleasing. 3. Progressive Disclosure: Only show users what they need when they need it. Overloading them with information upfront is overwhelming. Gradually guide them through complex features. 4. Feedback Systems: Implement immediate feedback for user actions. If they press a button, make something happen. It's a non-verbal way of saying, ""Yes, you're doing it right."" 5. Testing and Iteration: Test your design with real users. What seems intuitive to you might not be for others. Iterate based on feedback to ensure your product truly minimizes the need for instructions. 6. In a world where attention spans are short, the best way to engage users is to let them dive right in.
