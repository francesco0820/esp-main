"Vulnerable post 

I was having a blah kinda week. You know one of those weeks where you feel like you're running in a hamster wheel. Well my phenomenal staff at our Collins-Westside location decided to love on me today to show their appreciation during a pivotal time for us all, and ya'll they made me cry. 

A good cry though, one of gratitude. 
As a leader you don't always get it right, but every great leader surrounds themselves with great people, leads with good intentions, cultivates genuine relationships, and stays humble enough to pivot for the greater good. 

This Collins-Westside team, Ebony N. S. and I opened the 1st Walmart Health in the State of Florida, and Suzette Quaintance took the reigns and carried on our reputation of being the ""A"" Team, and boy do I love this team. This was just a handfull of them today, as we are winding down our operations across the enterprise. 

As we approach our final month of delivering care to our communities, what I will miss the most at Walmart Health, are the people. These people believed in our mission, they lived it, they executed it, and they did an amazing job! 

If I could sum up my Walmart Health experience in one word, it would simply be ""PROUD"". 

PROUD of our people
PROUD of our work
PROUD of our imprint
PROUD of our impact
PROUD of the seeds we have planted, that we hope to see grow. 

PROUD, is honestly an understatement, but... it will do for now.

"Do your employees connect with your company's purpose? Maybe, maybe not. According to a recent MIT Sloan study, 72 percent of people want to work for an organization with a purpose they believe in. At Schneider Electric, the number one engagement factor I have and hear from my team members and colleagues is their connection to our purpose, #lifeison. https://lnkd.in/etiU6KJC

And yet, sometimes, it can be hard to understand how your day-to-day job is contributing to the greater cause. As leaders, it's our responsibility to help our employees make that connection and embrace it at a personal level. 

But how do we do that? Here are a few suggestions on how to create a passionate and purposeful team: 

1) Offer Connections: Create a space for safe and open dialogue -- ask how they feel they are contributing to the company's purpose. And if they are struggling to see the connection, offer your own thoughts on how their work is helping to serve the greater good. 

2) Encourage Involvement: Recognize that everyone has their own passions. Provide time and support for employees to participate in employee resource and special interest groups, as well as company-sponsored volunteering and charitable initiatives. Doing so gives employees a greater sense of personal connection to the company, and offers them an opportunity to learn and grow as humans  something thats good for them and good for your business!

3) Celebrate Impact: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions employees make to your purpose, small or large. Every action counts. And recognizing individuals fosters a people-first work culture, where employees feel valued, seen, and heard.

When individuals and corporations find common ground in purpose, the impact is profound. Let's be leaders who champion this connection. 

How are you fostering the power of purpose in your teams?

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Many people know that I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer at age 27 and that experience of fighting cancer as a young woman greatly affected my life. 

It was through being treated and surviving breast cancer that I learned about the gaps in our healthcare system that overlooked young women. I wanted to ensure that young women were provided with the same resources and support that were available to older women, such as representation in clinical studies, access to support groups with other young people, and greater awareness in the medical community. 

No one should have to face cancer alone. The Young Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to improving the quality and quantity of life for those under 40 with breast cancer, continues to exist and flourish today because I was inspired to take action for the young women who would come behind me with similar diagnoses.

"As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to pay homage to my mother, Maria "" born and raised in Southern Spain.

Without her courage, strength and determination I would not be where I am today. I am extremely grateful for my Spanish roots and the lessons I learned from my mother. In fact, I'm reminded of a famous Spanish proverb that goes, ""Si te caes siete veces, levAntate ocho"" "" or in English, ""If you fall seven times, get up eight.""

Our 2 sessions have been potent.""There are 2 things that are incredibly important to me as an Executive Coach, emotional intelligence practitioner, developer of leaders.The first is making a difference. Making a contribution. The only way I know this to be possible is through listening. Listening actively - yes, and, more than that. Listening without judgement. Listening with my ears, eyes, heart...with my humanness that is hearing, seeing, and feeling.And that leads to the second thing. Asking questions that are directed at the thing between and beneath. This is the 'pack a big punch' compliment.I know what it's like to ask, and be asked, surface questions. These questions sometimes make a little progress and do a little thing and are 'fine' for some momentum. They keep you in the problem longer because these questions avoid what's at the root.Nutrient dense questions are the ones that liberate.These are also the questions that can make us the most uncomfortable and so we avoid them. We avoid asking them of ourselves and asking them of others.My question and invitation to you is this.What are you not asking that you need to ask?Listen with all of you - hear, see, feel what's at the root - and ask that nutrient dense question.

"A few years ago, while getting ready for bed on a Thanksgiving night, my father fell and fractured his hip. I drove to meet him in the emergency room, where the young woman at the front desk looked up at me and said, blandly, You must be here to see Room 4. I was actually there to see my dad, but resisted the opportunity to make that a teachable moment and headed to room 4. When I walked in, the nurse was standing with her hand on my dads shoulder. She greeted me warmly and started sharing what a cool guy my father is, that he must be in a lot of pain but has been joking and making her laugh, that hes been telling her about being with the family for Thanksgiving and even about my work in healthcare.

The Glasgow Consensus Statement  published last week and available at https://lnkd.in/ebr7dJXu  focuses on reinforcing the humanity in healthcare. The primary overarching task is to Connect as Humans. Thats the difference between room 4 and what a cool guy. Human connection is essential, not extra.

"Sometimes, it's the simple things that make the biggest impact. A great example of continuous innovation within our mobile app was the recent enhancements to our HealthSafe ID (HSID) capability for members to register for access.

One of the most frequent pain points we hear from our consumers is difficulty for dual eligible (DSNP) members (people with both a Medicare and Medicaid plan) in registering for an account. This population in particular is often dealing with some of the most complex healthcare challenges, and many times have lower access to digital resources and healthcare literacy.

In our new mobile experience - if the member chooses the wrong registration path or health plan, the HSID application will do everything it can to search for other plans in order to help ensure our members are able to register. This not only eliminates the burden from our members having to try and navigate account setup, it gives better access to the wealth of capabilities our market leading mobile ecosystem has to offer. 

Little changes like this can make a huge difference, in this case: we've seen double digit registration success growth in just a few short days! That's millions more members every year with better access to care. 

I am extremely proud of the team that made this happen.

"aRAG demos are easy. RAG in production is much harder. Why is it so?Recently I wrote about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the technique that enables enterprises to leverage the power of large language models (link in comment ).Many companies have experienced that their technology teams are able to demonstrate the use of RAG quite rapidly. However, when the time comes to put the solution into production, they face difficulties. The users do not accept the solution easily and many don't think it adds a lot of value.We will first see why the demos are easy and then reflect on the challenge of productionising RAG.Why are RAG demos easy?Y Simple architecture: The principle of RAG is quite simple to understand. In the basic RAG pipeline, there are very few components: vector database, source chunking, vector matching and LLM interface. It is easy for engineers to understand the architecture.Y Framework availability: To make matters simpler, helper frameworks such as Langchain and LlamaIndex are available. They come with built-in support for chunking, vector databases and LLMs. It is possible to build an RAG pipeline by writing a few lines of code, if you are using one of these frameworks. The initial results of such a pipeline are very impressive, mainly because of the language abilities of the LLMs. Thus great demonstrations can be built quickly with RAG. YYNow we will see why using RAG in production is challenging. Y Correct but not comprehensive: For simpler questions, the replies are often satisfactory. However, when complex questions are asked, the users find the answers correct, but not satisfactory. They feel that the reply covers only basic aspects, but not what they really needed.Y Source requirements: In order that RAG works, the necessary knowledge sources should be added to the vector index. It takes a lot of effort to judge the requirements of users and accordingly build the index. It does not stop here. The index must be forever updated with current information.Y Easy to add, difficult to remove: Once a source is added to the index, it starts influencing the answers. Many times, multiple sources contain conflicting information (for example, old and new price list). The answers in this case become unreliable.Y Data privacy: The quick RAG implementations typically use an external LLM api such as OpenAI or Google. In such cases, the internal data of an organization is sent to the outside world; creating a possibility of data privacy issues.Y Latency: As the index size grows, it takes a long time to select the right material for a query. This is unacceptable for real time use.Overcoming these challenges involves building a more complex pipeline. I will describe that in a later post, but here are some techniques that can help: reranking, knowledge graph, internal models, trust layers.hashtag#llm hashtag#retrievalaugmentedgeneration hashtag#aiinbusiness",Human-Centered Design
"2024 is our year for implementing care redesign programs across our hospital system. Our goal is to have ambient intelligence cameras in every acute care patient room and remote monitoring devices on all patients staying in an inpatient bed with plans to send them home with the device to continue monitoring in the outpatient setting. 

We know that we are bullish about innovation and sometimes implementing new technology in a hospital setting feels like trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables, but we have seen amazing results once we get through the change management hurdle. 
 With predictive analytics, the AI tools are 75% more accurate at projecting a patient's discharge date compared with our nurses' predictions alone. 
 With virtual nursing, we have been able to eliminate all contract nursing positions and add a fresh set of eyes to the patient floors which has led to great catches in discrepancies. 
 With ambient intelligence, we have seen a 15% increase in our OR capacity without adding any new staff members. 
 With remote monitoring, we have reduced telemetry needs and moved labor from one skillset to another. 

During our first 2024 Innovation Open House session last week, we hosted 20+ attendees from 7 healthcare organizations across the country. We would love to have you join us for future sessions.

"Users prefer to learn by doing. Not by reading instructions. Every extra word is an opportunity for users to abandon the product. They have more important stuff to do.This is where intuitive design come into play.Let's break it down: 1. Intuitive Navigation: Design your interface in a way that feels natural to the user. Familiar patterns, like swipe to refresh or pinch to zoom, are more effective than instructions. 2. Visual Cues: Use icons, colors, and visual hierarchy to guide users. A well-placed arrow or a different button color can direct users more efficiently than text. Make sure that the design is also aesthetically pleasing. 3. Progressive Disclosure: Only show users what they need when they need it. Overloading them with information upfront is overwhelming. Gradually guide them through complex features. 4. Feedback Systems: Implement immediate feedback for user actions. If they press a button, make something happen. It's a non-verbal way of saying, ""Yes, you're doing it right."" 5. Testing and Iteration: Test your design with real users. What seems intuitive to you might not be for others. Iterate based on feedback to ensure your product truly minimizes the need for instructions. 6. In a world where attention spans are short, the best way to engage users is to let them dive right in.

"JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s new Chase Media Solutions unit is a stroke of genius. Critics referencing #privacy concerns don't know what they're talking about. Why is it a stroke of genius? Because Chase will get paid twice. And merchants will pay twice. It's too funny. I've seen some criticism of this announcement from folks who think Chase will be selling customer data to advertisers. That's not how it will work. Instead, Chase will sell ad space on its digital properties to advertisers buying into Chase's pitch that the bank can improve ad targeting by analyzing the customer's spending patterns. It's a great move by Chase because they'll make $ by selling ad space and by generating more sales on its cards. It's an appealing deal for advertisers because--unlike other advertising approaches--they only pay when the customer makes a purchase. The irony is that when the purchase is made, the advertising firm not only pays for the ad, it pays the interchange fee on the card purchase. Another reason this is a stroke of genius is that the new advertising service could enable Chase to bundle--at some point--pricing for the advertising with interchange fees.The achilles heel here is that even Chase--as big as it is--doesn't have a 360-view of its customers' spending habits. Today's consumer spending behavior is so fragmented and specialized that it's likely that many Chase cardholders only use their Chase card for specific types of purchases--which will limit the range of advertisers any one cardholder will see.That might be a good thing, though--for both the cardholder and Chase. Might mean more relevant ads.From a broader banking industry perspective, this is an interesting move by Chase. Most of the community-based institutions I've talked to have historically been hesitant to--or outright against--putting 3rd party ads on their digital properties. And even if they want to do it, it begs the question how they would do it. Maybe a new service offering from a Q2, Alkami Technology, and/or NCR Voyix?https://lnkd.in/eyzCKudT#banking #marketing #digitalbankingMary Wisniewski Jason Henrichs   Jim Marous Alex Johnson Alex Jimenez Efi Pylarinou Al Dominick",Human-Centered Design

"I was thrilled to present at the ""Human Centered Design in Hospitals"" event last month, hosted by Highland and organized by Amrita Kulkarni. 

While I was there sharing our own stories of impact fromSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital, I was also lucky enough to learn from Brian Graziano and Christopher Neuharth.  Some reflections below! 

1. Working in design & innovation in hospitals requires you to be multilingual: A core capability of innovation & design teams must be ""speaking the language"" of basically every department, including the C-Suite. Our portfolio of projects demands rapid fluency in the language of patient experience, IT, HR, security, systems, audit, legal etc. 
 
2. ""Learn to Spear Fish"": In a discussion about prototyping and piloting, I was inspired by hearing, ""Your organization needs to eat, now."" It really got me thinking about a posture towards sourcing projects from collaborators and also putting novel ideas out in the wild in days, not months. 
 
3. ""'Nobody's job' might have to become your job"": By way of the remit of innovation & design groups, sometimes projects emerge because there is no clear, single accountable leader.",Human-Centered Design

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry loads carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now Tide Cold Certified  meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well  or even better  in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. Its a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And were proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tides ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

- Live events remain invaluable; engaging with professionals face-to-face highlighted the real challenges they face and how we can assist immediately.

- The buzz around AP and Invoice Automation in the US is undeniable. Professionals we interacted with emphasized the urgent need for support, noting that the US continues to lag behind Europe in this regard.

- Compliance is a rising concern in the US, especially for large companies operating internationally. The focus on reducing risks ties into a growing awareness of the importance of staying compliant.

- Collaboration was key throughout the event, showcasing the power of teamwork in driving impactful outcomes and value for our partners and clients.

- The exceptional experience, including an exclusive dinner at Epcot and front-row seats for the Firework show, highlighted the commitment to creating memorable moments for our guests (Im a Disney World fan so this was easy for me!)

 And finally, we engaged in a design jam with Anna Stoesz, Cindy Tam, and Bridget Feickert to learn more about rapid prototyping, the role of research, and top UX trends that emphasize iteration to support a continuous experience evolution.

A heartfelt thank you  to everyone involved in organizing ConsumerCon.!!
