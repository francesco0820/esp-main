Critics referencing #privacy concerns don't know what they're talking about. Why is it a stroke of genius? Because Chase will get paid twice. And merchants will pay twice. It's too funny. I've seen some criticism of this announcement from folks who think Chase will be selling customer data to advertisers. That's not how it will work. Instead, Chase will sell ad space on its digital properties to advertisers buying into Chase's pitch that the bank can improve ad targeting by analyzing the customer's spending patterns. It's a great move by Chase because they'll make $ by selling ad space and by generating more sales on its cards. It's an appealing deal for advertisers because--unlike other advertising approaches--they only pay when the customer makes a purchase. The irony is that when the purchase is made, the advertising firm not only pays for the ad, it pays the interchange fee on the card purchase. Another reason this is a stroke of genius is that the new advertising service could enable Chase to bundle--at some point--pricing for the advertising with interchange fees.The achilles heel here is that even Chase--as big as it is--doesn't have a 360-view of its customers' spending habits. Today's consumer spending behavior is so fragmented and specialized that it's likely that many Chase cardholders only use their Chase card for specific types of purchases--which will limit the range of advertisers any one cardholder will see.That might be a good thing, though--for both the cardholder and Chase. Might mean more relevant ads.From a broader banking industry perspective, this is an interesting move by Chase. Most of the community-based institutions I've talked to have historically been hesitant to--or outright against--putting 3rd party ads on their digital properties. And even if they want to do it, it begs the question how they would do it. Maybe a new service offering from a Q2, Alkami Technology, and/or NCR Voyix?https://lnkd.in/eyzCKudT#banking #marketing #digitalbankingMary Wisniewski Jason Henrichs ’¯ Jim Marous Alex Johnson Alex Jimenez Efi Pylarinou Al Dominick","Digital Transformation,Human-centered design",,news article,,Matthew ,Smith,Webster ,Banking,Chief Digital Banking Officer,201,55,14,2w,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/chase-bank-to-let-advertisers-target-customers-based-on-spending-data-275f8226?mod=hp_minor_pos1,Matthew Smith liked Rasha Katabiâ€™s comment on this,Liked a comment,,2024-04-05 00:41,4/5/2024,Friday,Friday,12:41 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,270,Engagement,12-1am,April 2024,

📱 Salvo is a chronic metabolic and gastroenterology company targeting the over 60 million Americans with chronic gut and GI conditions, providing them with digital wraparound care.

🥕 Patients are treated through an app, specialized virtual care teams, and various intervention programs including:

• Low-FODMAP elimination diets
• microbiome restoration
• cognitive behavioral therapy
• lifestyle coaching (sleep, exercise, stress, etc.)

💰 On the heels of a recent $5m raise, Salvo has plans to take their “whole-person” approach used for chronic gut and GI patients, and apply it to other chronic conditions. Future partnerships will include specialty clinics beyond gastroenterology such as obesity medicine, bariatric, and endocrinology.

➡️ Today’s episode covers:

• digitization in healthcare
• microbiome in health and disease
• “whole-person” care
• Salvo’s recent capital raise
• low cost health interventions

While I was there sharing our own stories of impact fromSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital, I was also lucky enough to learn from Brian Graziano and Christopher Neuharth.  Some reflections below! 

1. Working in design & innovation in hospitals requires you to be multilingual: A core capability of innovation & design teams must be ""speaking the language"" of basically every department, including the C-Suite. Our portfolio of projects demands rapid fluency in the language of patient experience, IT, HR, security, systems, audit, legal etc. 
 
2. ""Learn to Spear Fish"": In a discussion about prototyping and piloting, I was inspired by hearing, ""Your organization needs to eat, now."" It really got me thinking about a posture towards sourcing projects from collaborators and also putting novel ideas out in the wild in days, not months. 
 
3. ""'Nobody's job' might have to become your job"": By way of the remit of innovation & design groups, sometimes projects emerge because there is no clear, single accountable leader.",Human-centered design,,Personal/Public Pictures,,Rev,Sellapan,St. Jude ,Healthcare Providers,"VP, Analytics",100,5,2,2w,,,,Rev Sellappan loves this,Reaction,,2024-05-13 11:49,5/13/2024,Monday,Monday,11:49 AM,,,,,,,,,,,107,Engagement,11am-12pm,May 2024,checked

With an understanding that almost 70% of a laundry load’s carbon footprint is in the consumer use phase, driven by the energy required to heat water, the Tide team did just that. In partnership with Electrolux Group, GE Appliances, a Haier company and Samsung Electronics, a new line of washing machines are now “Tide Cold Certified” – meaning these machines can wash clothes just as well – or even better – in cold water with Tide products as they do in warm. It’s a simple, and easy, way to do laundry more sustainably. And we’re proud to be at the forefront of this effort.

Working together with our partners enables us to further advance Tide’s ambition of turning three out of four loads of laundry to cold water washing in the U.S. and Canada by 2030. Together, we can create a positive, long-lasting impact on the #planet.

Here are some key takeaways:

- Live events remain invaluable; engaging with professionals face-to-face highlighted the real challenges they face and how we can assist immediately.

- The buzz around AP and Invoice Automation in the US is undeniable. Professionals we interacted with emphasized the urgent need for support, noting that the US continues to lag behind Europe in this regard.

- Compliance is a rising concern in the US, especially for large companies operating internationally. The focus on reducing risks ties into a growing awareness of the importance of staying compliant.

- Collaboration was key throughout the event, showcasing the power of teamwork in driving impactful outcomes and value for our partners and clients.

- The exceptional experience, including an exclusive dinner at Epcot and front-row seats for the Firework show, highlighted the commitment to creating memorable moments for our guests (I’m a Disney World fan so this was easy for me!)

Exciting times lie ahead at Basware with a strong focus on delivering value for our customers alongside our outstanding partners!

We’re extremely fortunate to such friendly people onsite esp. Mike and Jeff who helped educate us deeply about their onsite processes, letting us throw and catch mods ourselves by hand, giving us insights to fine tune and improve robot and flow of work cycle times. When we release XR-002, these guys are the ones directly responsible for some key updates - Forever appreciative 💛

And of course, our robot production numbers would be zero if it wasn’t for our fantastic crew mates: Angel, Orlando, Edwardo, Chino, & Maritza. Our robots are here to help, but y’all are the real heroes physically building our sustainable future, one panel at a time 🙏","Product Development,Human-centered design",,Personal/Public Pictures,,Sander,Cohan,National Grid,Utilities,"Head, Innovation",176,10,7,5d,,,,Sander Cohan celebrates this,Celebrates,,2024-05-23 20:00,5/23/2024,Thursday,Thursday,8:00 PM,,,,,,,,,,,193,Engagement,8pm-9pm,May 2024,checked
