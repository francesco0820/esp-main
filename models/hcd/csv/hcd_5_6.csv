Thanks to Subject Matter Experts and digital transformation leaders Saumya Vardhan, Kamala Manju Kesavan, and Stephen Ma in sharing their insights and experiences.
The main focus of this panel was on developing #Human-Centered Design #TechnologyEcosystem to shift from compliance ( meeting minimum standards) to  regeo( capacity building and living whole system thinking), and shift from #TechnologicalSustainability to #EcologicalSustainability to accomplish #ESG(enviromental, social, and governance) goals through digital transformation. Likewise, our panel emphasized the financial benefits in all organizations.
Our panel outcome: Creating a digital Technology Ecosystem that embraces Sustainability and regenerative solutions to build a better future for the current residents of our #planet 🌍, for our next #generations, and all #beings. 👫🌈☁️🌎🪐🌴🌲🪸🐬🦍🐢🕷️🐍🦒🕊️🦢

https://www.linkedin.com/in/durhamjulie/,"Last week, we experienced the ultimate Consumer Health Care – focused event, The inaugural Optum 💥""ConsumerCon”💥, where our teams of Product, Engineering, Design, Business and Operations collaborated to create outstanding digital experiences, and shape the future of customer-focused healthcare experiences ⚡🧡⚡ .
A huge THANK You to the cross UnitedHealth Group teams and leaders who came together to make this happen!

The two-day event was full of insights and learnings. Here are some of the highlights:
🧡 Rita Khan and I jointly shared the need for a unified consumer digital strategy, essential digital capabilities, and the value of data-driven insights.
🧡 Sandeep Dadlani shared valuable advice on how to avoid pitfalls that hinder a culture of fast innovation and growth at scale.
🧡 Professor Peter Fader led discussions on customer lifetime value and its power in creating the most important experiences for our members and patients
🧡 Katie Schumacher and Jared Carr led a session to identify solutions for key consumer pain points, and shared their “why” .
🧡 Chris Hanson turned product development into a fun, agile-building exercise with Lego models (who would have thought?)
🧡 Terry Clark showed us why it matters to advocate for solutions that meet individual healthcare needs.
🧡 Robbi Thatcher moderated a panel that brought insight from consumer advocates, who inspired all of us to be closer to our customers.
🧡 And finally, we engaged in a “design jam” with Anna Stoesz, Cindy Tam, and Bridget Feickert to learn more about rapid prototyping, the role of research, and top UX trends that emphasize iteration to support a continuous experience evolution.

A heartfelt thank you 🙏 to everyone involved in organizing ConsumerCon.!!
