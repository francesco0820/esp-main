https://www.linkedin.com/in/muratgen/,"🚀 At Lumos, we raised a $35m Series B from Scale Venture Partners with Andreessen Horowitz, Neo and Harpoon Ventures participating.

As a technologist, I've been always fascinated by the power of software. We've seen with the recent rise of GenAI how much technology can enable us to create more.

As companies use now over 650 apps, there is this overwhelming complexity around managing them and real consequences: more breaches, exploding software spend and slow internal processes.

To combat that, we decided to build an app for all apps (I know, very meta) - Lumos. Lumos is the Unified Access Platform to help companies manage their user's access to apps and data.

I'm grateful for all the new customers who joined us on that mission over the last two years (Pinterest, MongoDB, GitHub, Roku & many more).

I'm also grateful for now almost 100 Alchemists who contributed to this journey.

We entered into an agreement to acquire WalkMe™, a prominent leader in digital adoption platforms (DAPs), that perfectly complements SAP Business Transformation portfolio like SAP Signavio and SAP LeanIX. This will further enhance SAP customers’ digital adoption and user productivity.

We acknowledged that transformation is not just technology, but business opportunities to be continuously driven. The value derived from adopting SAP solutions is already immense and will only get better. We estimate SAP customers to benefit from $2.4 trillion in economic savings and $5.4 trillion in revenue increase when adopting our solutions.

It was a pleasure that we were joined by Brian Hardee of PureTech Scientific, Jeff Lischett of Tropicana Brands Group, Ingo Elfering of Fresenius Group and Takuya Sakai of Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. They shared their first-hand experiences in adopting our key solutions like RISE with SAP accelerating with Business AI copilot Joule, to being innovation-ready with clean core ERP. Thank you again all SAP customers for your trust and confidence in us!

We also emphasized our commitment in sustainability, where we continue to strive in creating sustainable solutions that deliver successful business outcomes and positive environmental impact.

Operating earnings continue to modestly surprise to the upside and earnings guidance for large company stocks has a positive overtone. The next policy move by the Federal Reserve is most likely a rate cut which will happen once central bank officials have a greater confidence level that inflation is returning in a persistent manner to the 2% target.

As a co-founder of SCI Ventures, we’re on a mission to spark innovation and bridge the gap between lab research and making discoveries available to help restore functions for those with spinal cord injury and ultimately cure paralysis.

At Shepherd Center, we’re honored to come together with Wings for Life - Spinal Cord Research Foundation, Spinal Research, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, and Promobilia Foundation to support this single, first-of-its-kind, and truly game-changing investment vehicle. Through our combined network and knowledge, we plan to attract more capital to the SCI space by lowering the risk for additional investors from across the VC and healthcare industries. 

Through our combined network and knowledge, we hope to attract more capital, investment, and awareness to develop therapies that will help people begin again after spinal cord injury.
