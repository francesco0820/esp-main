"In a recent Bloomberg article discussing the proposed acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel Corp., Josh Spoores, CRU's Principal Steel Analyst, provided insights into the industry sentiment amid the ongoing political scrutiny. As opposition intensifies in Washington, insiders within the steel industry voice their support for the deal. Josh highlighted the potential negotiation leverage of the union, stating:In terms of the union, it's probably right they can get a pound of flesh and some promise for investment in their union jobs.Read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/g3WnHkQp#SteelIndustry #UnitedStates #NipponSteel",Transactions

"Chime likely to IPO in 2025 and has more primary bank accounts than chase.  It seems like Ron Shevlin started a sh*t storm. Here's my take Chime are planning a 2025 IPO, according to Bloomberg. With 38m customers, Chime may have more primary users than Bank of America. Ron Shevlin says about half consider Chime to be their primary checking account, which would put them between PayPal and Wells Fargo in market share.My take  Chime has disrupted the market. An IPO in 2025 would be a crowning moment for them. Their demographic today skews lower income, which is harder to make a profit from, despite their low-cost operating model. The path to profitability is likely via going up market and/or cross-selling.  Chime will cross-sell successfully, but I'm not sure its brand can go upmarket. Nobody has quite nailed that premium millennial Fintech consumer experience high ground Monzo and Starling took in the UK. The UK digital banks' first cohorts are aging into being high deposit balance customers. Chime's wedge in get paid early and credit building just doesn't feel aspirational. That's not a knock; the market needs what it does desperately. It's just a brand question.  Primary checking account is such a BS term. Chase defines it as anyone with over $500 monthly deposits plus 5x transactions. But that could also mean it's a paycheck motel. Money comes in and goes out. Primary used to mean the top of the wallet and first in line to cross-sell. Today it just means collecting a good chunk of consumer deposit balances TM   Does Chime ever want to be a bank? When they IPO they'll have that sweet tech company multiple. Banks get valued very differently. But I think the trick is to be a growth stock. You can do that with a balance sheet. It's working for Nubank, it's sort of working for SoFi (which, arguably, it shouldn't), and it will work for Monzo. If I were advising them, I'd stay away from the charter for ~3 to 5 years until they figure out lending, and then buy a charter to improve economics further down the line.You'll find this and much more by heading to sytaylor.substack .com and hitting subscribe#fintech #ipo #neobanks",Transactions

"Robinhood is a lending company. Fintech VCs need to stop saying they won't invest in lending companies. Robinhood is $18 billion mkt cap and their revenue growth is coming from...lending.  This isn't just about the new credit card. Robinhood Gold drives most of their revenue growth and Gold monetizes primarily thru lending. They already have margin lending, which is INCREASING 40% yoy.  Their non-lending trading revenue is DECREASING. Their new credit card will monetize not on interchange (giving 3% cash back means no net interchange revenue). So how will the credit card monetize? lending.  net interest income on revolvers (ppl who carry a balance)It's not that surprising. their average AUM is <$5k client. it's hard to monetize on those users in a repeatable way other than lending (having them day trade options works ok, but not everyone will do that). Lending at Robinhood could be as big as rest of their business combined.If you invest in fintech, your best companies will one day monetize thru lending even if they don't start there, because lending is one of the most important monetization levers in financial services.",Transactions

"TechCrunch: Conversational AI platform Parloa has nabbed $66 million in a Series B round of funding, a year after the German startup raised $21 million from a swathe of European investors to propel its international growth.

Aside form lead investor Altimeter, Parloas Series B round included cash injections from EQT Ventures, Newion, Senovo, Mosaic Ventures and La Familia Growth. Todays funding brings Parloas total capital raised to-date to $98 million, following its $21 million Series A funding round led by EQT Ventures in 2023.

Parloa is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI with everything hype that has hit fever pitch these past couple of years, as companies seek new ways to improve efficiency through automation.

Founded out of Germany in 2018, Parloa has already secured high-profile customers such as European insurance giant Swiss Life and sporting goods retailer Decathlon, which use the Parloa platform to automate customer communications including emails and instant messaging.

However, voice is where co-founder and CEO Malte Kosub reckons Parloa stands out.

Our strategy has always been centered around voice first, the most critical and impactful facet of the customer experience, Kosub told TechCrunch over email. As a result, Parloas AI-based voice conversations sound more human than any other solution.

" Im excited to announce what weve been working on for the last few months: the creation of Yuna, an AI and storytelling startup, and our $1.6 million dollar pre-seed round  

So whats the story? 

The sobering reality is that the magic of reading books is slowly being replaced by other forms of media. Each successive generation is enjoying fewer of the well known benefits that come with getting lost in a wonderful book (cognitive development, creativity, empathy, to name but a few).

What if we could reverse this trend? What if we could find a way to make reading just as engaging as watching Netflix, and eventually the 1st entertainment choice for children?

And so we wrote Yuna into existence. By combining AI with the enchantment of human creativity, Yuna writes books that are so personalised and interactive that they can be as engaging as any modern media platforms. Leveraging AI to empower writers, illustrators and publishers, Yuna imagines new forms of storytelling:

 Imagine a book that every night writes the next chapter of a personalised adventure involving you, your daughter and dog, weaving your familys interests into the narrative.

 Imagine a book that invites your niece to enter Hogwarts as a 1st year student and experience their own unique story through the wizarding world.

 Imagine a book that helps you discuss difficult topics with your son but in the form of an imaginary tale with him and his favourite character Snoopy. 

Over time, we hope to make these dreams come true, all with a singular goal: to ensure that children build a healthy reading habit for life.

Thanks to the hard work of the incredible Yuna team, weve been testing early versions of these ideas. Over the past 5 months, Yuna has written 100,000+ unique stories to 20,000 monthly active users. And we are growing fast - we expect to write the next 100,000 books within a few weeks of this announcement. Thank you Yuna team - you are truly epic.

A massive thank you to the partners involved in our $1.6M pre-seed round: Canary who led and who have been incredible every day since (special shoutout to Florian Hagenbuch who has been a believer and mentor from day -1); The Positive Ventures team and angel investors who followed the round and recognised Yunas potential to make a positive impact on the world (thank you especially to Fabio Kestenbaum!). Finally - Taahir Munshi, Pedro Sonego de Oliveira, Flora Oliveira, Fabian Wikstrom and Carolina Guimaraes, who played pivotal roles in turning Yuna from distant dream to reality during those early days. 

Now what?

Today, we are launching our beta test product in Brazil in Portuguese. If you are in Brazil, please give it a shot (see link in comments). If you are not, Yuna isnt available to test just yet, but fear not! Yuna is bringing its vision to the  very soon.

" We're Excited to Announce Our $50M Series B Funding! 

Learn more about our journey & where were headed  https://hubs.la/Q02wqnxn0.

Today marks a monumental milestone for Rad AI as we celebrate the successful closure of our Series B round. A heartfelt thank you to our new and continuing partners as well as investors who share our commitment to transforming radiology through cutting-edge technology.

 The Impact: Why This Matters
Since 2018, Rad AI has been pioneering generative AI in healthcare, introducing the first proprietary LLMs for commercial healthcare applications. Today, Rad AI is the most trusted GenAI platform for radiology workflow, used by over a third of US health systems and 9 of the 10 largest US radiology practices.

Our latest solution, Rad AI Reporting, builds on the success of Rad AI Omni Impressions to fully replace legacy voice recognition software. Rad AI Reporting supports all existing radiologist workflows and introduces new GenAI capabilities to simplify reporting, significantly reducing provider fatigue and burnout while improving productivity. Recently, it was named Best New Radiology Software by AuntMinnie.com, the best-known annual recognition in radiology.

Thank you to our incredible team, whose dedication and innovation has brought us here. The journey continues, and with this support, we are more equipped than ever to advance our mission to transform healthcare.

"It's a big week for Rad AI with the announcement of our $50M Series B Funding round led by Khosla Ventures. 

As we celebrate this milestone and chart out course for the future, I can't help but reflect back to 2019 when Jeff Chang and Doktor Gurson were just getting started. Dr. Chang was a practicing radiologist at Greensboro Radiology and I was leading the sales team at Canopy Partners (a sister company). 

I remember joining Dr. Chang for one of his first sales meetings with our hometown health system Cone Health. We met with key execs, listened to their challenges, and asked probing questions about how #AI might be able to address some of these challenges. Dr. Chang took copious notes and, as we left the meeting, I asked him if he came away with any useful ideas for products. He did indeed and Cone Health ultimately became Rad AI's first health system client. 

I remember this like it was yesterday because I was so impressed with Dr. Chang's commitment to listening and developing innovative products designed to improve care delivery and solve customer challenges. That was 5 years ago and Rad AI has grown tremendously since then, but this customer-first approach is still in the DNA of our company today ... and I hope it always will be.

The electrical grid is becoming more complex to manage as distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewables proliferate.

ThinkLabs autonomous orchestration copilot empowers control room operators to reliably operate the modern grid. The ThinkLabs Copilot is powered by a proprietary digital twin of the grid, which uses physics-informed AI to generate real-time insights. ThinkLabs capabilities are a critical step towards supporting the grid during the electrification and renewables era.

Powerhouse Ventures is proud to co-lead ThinkLabs $5M Seed with Active Impact Investments, with additional participation from Blackhorn Ventures, Amplify Capital, Mercuria, and a national US energy company.
