The union focused instead on the administration's infrastructure spending push and worker-centric trade policy.Workers and their families are more secure than they were four years ago, thanks to President Biden's leadership. From infrastructure to retirement security, international trade to safer workplaces, President Biden got the job done, USW International president David McCall said. We're honored to back him as he runs for re-election.The Nippon-US Steel deal has received hefty criticism from both the right and the left. Nippon has repeatedly said that it intends to follow US Steel's original plan of investment in its Big River mill in Arkansas. It has also said it does not intend to close any legacy assets in US Steel's heartland. In fact, the company intends to move its US headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, if the deal is completed.

Together, they reminded me the importance of showing up, working hard and having fun along the way.  The videos messages, calls and notes from field partners, past and current home office associates was a special touch and made me grateful for those who I have had the privilege to work with.  Thank you to our team for being so thoughtful - yesterday's celebratory happy hour was the cherry on the sundae. A gift, pictured above, cites the first verse of an old Irish Blessing I have shared countless times at recognition events and meetings.  I have been blessed to be a part of a team that cares greatly about the work they do and how they do it.  Dad always said there is no right way to do the wrong thing “ so true. As you celebrate your milestones and count your blessings allow me to end this note with the last verse:   May all life's passing seasons bring the best to you and yours.

However, it is critical to get clear on what went RIGHT so the good can be repeated.”Step 2: What Didn't Go WellAfter reviewing what went well and the successes we can repeat in the future, we move on to constructive criticism.We frame the discussion with a similar question:What replicable new learning did we gain from what did not go well?Notice - the question isn't asking what went wrong... specifically what is the new LESSON we can incorporate for the future.”Step 3: New StandardsOnce we've dissected the lessons from what went well and what didn't, we turn our focus to the future.Combining the insights from the first two steps, we assess the following:Drawing upon questions 1 and 2, what changes can we make to our processes to systematically improve our consistent tactical excellence?This reinforces that the standard is excellence, clear process is how we get there, and asks what improvements to our process move us ahead?”Process note - each participant should complete these questions in writing 24 hours in advance.AAR sessions begin with reading all of the written feedback.Then the meeting owner leads the discussion of each question.“That's an AAR process at a high level.1. What went well (to be repeated)2. What lessons exist from what didn't go well3. How we'll modify our processes going forward (with excellence as the standard)Give it a shot.If this resonates, please share ™»¸ this post and follow Matt Schnuck for insights on inflections in life, entrepreneurship and 25 years in business.",MISC,,,,Patrick,Weis,Delta Dentals (CA),Healthcare Payers,"Director, Technology Operations",3203,276,371,1mo,,,,Patrick Weis reposted this,Repost,,2024-03-25 16:13,3/25/2024,Monday,Monday,4:13 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,3850,Engagement,4pm-5pm,March 2024,

It felt oddly familiar, reminding me of another mom who had abdominal surgery, a life-altering cancer when very young, and a dad who had to keep working, sort out how to care for his family here, while coping with aging and ill parents there. These young, recent immigrants, and new parents who also needed time to manage shocking news, to figure out how to keep their little 3 year old girl steady and not scared.  (Photo below taken weeks before moms diagnosis)My dad courageously kept life moving, being a male caregiver of me and my mom.  Working hard to make sure if I was cared for by others, I'd come home every evening to be with him when mom was in the hospital.  All part of managing through my mom's first (of the 5 cancers she'd ultimately experience) that kept her away from us and a more normal life for several months at a time.  A time that also forced them to explain why there would be no more children - particularly tricky since the first was a girl . So much ahead for these two - early onset dementia 20 years later for him.  Decades of extreme grace and resilience for her ...These adults, still kids in their 20s/30s away from home, cautiously choosing words carefully to not alarm anyone back home by saying the C word. All while pushing down fear and appearing as if things were normal.It's not hard to remember my parents and our family this weekend.  So many of us can relate to the challenges faced by young families who manage through cancer.  It hits pretty darn close. These moments in the news remind us that every family responds in their own way, it's their own experience,  and they need support, culturally unique and defined, yet always wrapped with universal empathy.

She told a story about when her daughter was trying out for her blackbelt in karate.While her daughter was very anxious, the karate instructor didn't tell her daughter to dismiss or bury her fears. He encouraged her to reframe them”from a source of anxiety to a source of power.His advice: ¦‹Get your butterflies in formation.¦‹Instead of letting the energy of fear deter her, she could channel it toward her goal. I love this advice!I think about this advice in my role as an entrepreneur. Some elements of my work still make me nervous (public speaking is a good example). However, I see two choices: let the nerves get to me or use the nervous energy to make me better. I choose the latter.People sometimes assume you have to be fearless to be a founder. I disagree. It's about channeling the fear to help us keep going.We will always encounter our fears when we grow and challenge ourselves.We can see them as excuses to quit, or we can reframe them as fuel to push us forward.#leadership #courage #power #entrepreneurship",MISC,,,,Katya,Aandresen,Cigna,Healthcare Payers,Chief Digital & Analytics Officer,171,18,5,1mo,,,,Katya Andresen likes this,Likes,,2024-03-25 15:27,3/25/2024,Monday,Monday,3:27 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,194,Engagement,3pm-4pm,March 2024,

It was an honour for me to host and moderate alongside distinguished co-hosts, Dr. Ellen Ringier and Anat Bar-Gera, as well as our esteemed presenters: Her Excellency Ambassador Ifat Reshef, Dr. Tatiana Kotlyarenko, Member of the Israeli Parliament #SharrenHaskel, Tal Hochman, and DALITH Steiger-Gablinger’». Thank you for sharing your experiences with us. We wanted to remind the world that there are still 134 innocent human beings, men, women, elderly, even babies being kept #hostage in Gaza. They need to be freed immediately and unconditionally! And we wanted to teach our audience about the atrocities that marked the October 7th attack by the #Hamas terror organization. May the 1200 souls that lost their lives never be forgotten. We also expressed the profound sorrow we feel for the Palestinian families in #Gaza, who find themselves trapped in an unfathomable situation. Civilians are caught in crossfires and are paying the price with their lives and their loved ones. An undeserved tragedy for too many! Yet, amidst these reflections, our hope for #peace remains undiminished. A long-term solution, one that fosters understanding and coexistence between both sides, is imperative. This event was a step towards reminding the world of these critical issues, and I am forever grateful to everyone who lent their voice, their time, and their commitment to this cause.

This event was a symphony of brilliant minds, groundbreaking ideas, and transformative discussions that left an indelible mark on me. One session that stood out was the fireside chat on ""Leading Through Change “ A Rulebook for Navigating Through Uncertainties"". Madlen Ivanova, Seemantini Godbole, and Sheila Jordan shared their personal journeys, painting a vivid picture of their rise in their fields, their triumph over internal fears, and their embrace of a 'let me be me' work culture. Sheila Jordan's concept of 'work-life integration' struck a chord with me, challenging the traditional notion of work-life balance and advocating for a more integrated approach.Seemantini Godbole's talk was a revelation. She challenged the conventional definition of 'work', arguing that networking, discussing deals, and solving problems are all part of the work process, even when we're away from our desks. This shift in perspective was a game-changer, promising to make a significant difference in both my personal and professional life.The conference was also a deep dive into the technical side of data science. Workshops by Kornelia Bastin, Chloe Pinkston, Ava Grossman, and Stephanie Radlick provided valuable insights into fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and exploring the world of Generative AI. These sessions were enlightening, offering practical tips and hands-on experience with these powerful AI tools.The networking opportunities were a highlight of the conference. I had the pleasure of interacting with inspiring individuals from Lowe's and Sia Partners. Their professional journeys were a testament to their dedication and passion for data science. A special mention to Megan Smith, Elizabeth Johnson, Jay Purcell, Duubar Villalobos Jimenez, jerome dormoy, Joseph Keating, Utwej Sai, Aida Miros, Connor Smith, Khalil K., Brianne Zavala, Haotian Feng, and many others for their valuable insights and shared experiences.A heartfelt thank you to the organizers from the School of Data Science: Doug Hague, Joshua Hertel, and Carly Mahedy.

We are 0-6. As we left the field, my son was dejected and said, ""Dad, we are terrible"". I pondered what to say next and after I while, I offered him this:Sometimes the score of a game doesn't accurately reflect the effort of a team. I could see he was confused and I took him back to his last at bat where he struck out against what is likely the best pitcher in the league. He was fast to remind me he struck out. I acknowledged that yes, you did, and ultimately you failed to get on base. That said, I reminded him he fouled off several pitches straight back. I shared, you never gave up, you kept at it, you battled but came up short. That's going to happen but there's a lesson to be learned there. Still confused, he asked me what the lesson was.So I asked him if he knew what it means when a batter fouls a pitch straight back? He said, no, it's just a foul ball. I reminded him that foul balls hit straight back means, you've timed the pitcher. You're right on it. What that tells me is you were really close to getting on base. I bet the next time you face the same pitcher, you will get a hit. As we were putting our stuff away, he said to me ""losing sucks"". I laughed and said, oh it does buddy. However, do you remember what it felt like last year when your team went undefeated? It didn't take him too long to recall that and he smiled and said, ""yeah, that was awesome"". I reminded him that in life you will have successes, but you will also have times where you don't succeed. The times you succeed will remind you about all the hard work you put into your success. The times you don't will prompt you to appreciate the successes you had and also allow you to learn for the next time. Lastly, I reminded him that as you grow up, you will experience people that are better than you in the moment. When that happens, you tip your cap to them and and be gracious in defeat, then you turn the page and begin to learn from the past so you can guide your future. At that point, he was done with my motivational speech and just wanted to go home for ice cream. #leadershiplessons #learning #development #training #knowledge #icecream",MISC,,,,Shachella,James,CenterPoint Energy,Utilities,Vice President Infrastructure and Technology Services at CenterPoint Energy,252,23,1,1mo,,,,"Shachella James, PMP likes this",Likes,,2024-03-25 02:39,3/25/2024,Monday,Monday,2:39 AM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/b808a897-75a3-437f-9726-806a5a4a10f2,,,,,,,,checked,,276,Engagement,2am-3am,March 2024,

Trust your #EmotionalIntelligence and dream BIG. If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough. I had a delightful time sharing #leadership insights with C©line Kajoulis on Radio Classique's ˜Secret de Dirigeants' #podcast.We started from one question: Is attending an elite school still the only way to become a CEO? No! From my humble childhood to eventually becoming a CEO, transforming multinational companies, I forged my own path through hard work and #meritocracy.BUTI don't want my story to remain anecdotal. To the next generation of #STEM leaders and beyond, I encourage you to not be afraid to dare AND show emotional intelligence, empathy, and humility. You need to create strong bonds with your people, especially in tough times. That is what authentic leadership is all about.AND it's even more important to accept your vulnerability and bring your whole self to work. That's what we strongly believe in at Syensqo. Doubts or hesitation are not a weakness, but also part of who we are.Never stop learning, unlearning, and relearning. Be always in continuous evolution, be inspiredand don't forget to have fun! If we all apply this, I have a tip for all companies out there: Look out for your #internsone day they CAN become your CEO!You can listen to the whole podcast episode here (in French): https://bit.ly/4cqBhyh#Syensqo #WeAreExplorers #AdvancingHumanity #talent #ThoughtLeadership #innovationweek",MISC,Leadership,Personal/Public Pictures,,Hillary,Crawford,Sealed Air,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Vice President, Innovation Services",967,23,15,1mo,,,,Hillary Crawford likes this,Likes,,2024-03-25 16:21,3/25/2024,Monday,Monday,4:21 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,1005,Engagement,4pm-5pm,March 2024,

Her approach to style is not just about clothing; but about self-expression, creativity, and embracing one's true identity without reservation.What sets Apfel apart is her flamboyant attire and her unwavering confidence in wearing whatever makes her feel empowered and alive.

I have learned so much during my time with the firm, working with and learning from some of the very best in Private Equity. And I enjoyed supporting many great portfolio companies on their own journey from good to great. The last two years have been a period of incredible transition for me, both personally and professionally. I am incredibly grateful for the support of my friend and manager, Rachel Spasser, as well as my friends on the Operating Team. This apple is not falling far from the tree. I am excited to be joining Basware, the Accel-KKR company I have supported most in my time with the firm. As Basware's new Chief of Staff I will be working across the firm to help drive value from strategic initiatives. Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by. I look forward to sharing more about this journey after I make my transition. For now, I'd like to say another big thank you to friends and colleagues at Accel-KKR and its many portfolio companies for an amazing couple of years. Thank you AKKR, it's been a joy!Team Basware....

Crystal Wolf will be serving as the Chapter President-Elect beginning on July 1, 2024, and her presidency will begin on July 1, 2025. Crystal has provided services in finance optimization, governance, risk and control, and compliance for various Federal agencies, including the government's largest loan and grant programs to support families, students, and small businesses across the country. Crystal is a proud CGFM and has been a part of the DC Chapter since 2007 and has been serving as the Chair or Co-Chair of the Member Services Committee since then. Under Crystal's leadership, the DC Chapter consistently puts on sold-out networking events throughout the year as she's looking for new and creative ideas to bring Chapter members together and also connect with other local chapters. Crystal also actively participates in various national and local chapter activities, including participating and moderating training sessions, leading surveys and thought leadership development, and attending the AGA LEAD. We are excited for Crystal to bring her vast AGA experience to this important role!  Wendy Allen was selected to serve as the Treasurer-Elect, also beginning on July 1, 2024, and will support Mona Amatie when her term as Treasurer begins on July 1, 2024. Wendy is a Managing Director in KPMG's Federal Audit Practice. She has over 28 years of accounting experience, including 20 years providing professional audit services to the Federal government. Wendy has been a member of AGA DC Chapter for more than 16 years. As a CGFM herself, Wendy has served on the DC Chapter's CGFM Committee for four years to support our members to pursue the CGFM certification. Her leadership as the CGFM Committee Director led our Chapter to win the national CGFM Chapter awards for multiple years. Wendy has been serving on our Chapter's Strategic Direction Committee since 2020. Wendy leads the Chapter's various survey planning, execution, and analysis efforts, which are critical work for our Chapter to meet the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) requirements in providing CPEs for our luncheon program and to analyze our members' satisfaction with our Chapter's events and programs. Wendy also leads the Chapter's annual operating plan development efforts and currently serves as one of the appointed Chapter Directors.  Please join us in congratulating and welcome our new leaders!

Would like to roll my eyes or say ""OMG, stop asking stupid questions and order a frigging coffee already.""But I don't.We are adults. We don't let everything that passes through our brains come out our mouths.My husband and I stopped at a McDonald's on the NJ Parkway.He took the dog for a tinkle, and I ran in to grab a few burgers.I said ""Hi, how are you?"" to the gal taking my order. I said, ""I love your glasses.""  She had on a cool pair of purple readers.She smiled, ""Thank you.  Your order will just be a few minutes.""As I grabbed my cups to fill them up at the fountain, I asked the young man to throw some salt in my bag.He said, 'Do you need a drink carrier?""No, I'm good"" I replied.The Manager walked over, I said ""Great team you have here!""He did a doubletake, the widest grin spread across his face, and said ""Thank you so much!""He asked me if I needed help out the door.

This award is for Rockwell Automation's continuous efforts to meet our customers where they are in their digital transformation journey.Our IT #innovation teams at Rockwell Automation, in collaboration with colleagues across the company, applied AI to our industrial internet of things (IIoT) data collection platform and built a root cause analysis (RCA) capability within the batch performance analytics (BPA) solution. With BPA, customers can analyze vast amounts of real-time sensor data, identify anomalies and root cause errors, simulate, and prioritize, a corrective action plan, and predict future issues. This solution position companies to move from automation to autonomy - correcting manufacturing processes in real time and driving quality issues towards zero.

I have learned so much during my time with the firm, working with and learning from some of the very best in Private Equity. And I enjoyed supporting many great portfolio companies on their own journey from good to great. The last two years have been a period of incredible transition for me, both personally and professionally. I am incredibly grateful for the support of my friend and manager, Rachel Spasser, as well as my friends on the Operating Team. This apple is not falling far from the tree. I am excited to be joining Basware, the Accel-KKR company I have supported most in my time with the firm. As Basware's new Chief of Staff I will be working across the firm to help drive value from strategic initiatives. Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by. I look forward to sharing more about this journey after I make my transition. For now, I'd like to say another big thank you to friends and colleagues at Accel-KKR and its many portfolio companies for an amazing couple of years. Thank you AKKR, it's been a joy!Team Basware....

As any working parent knows, keeping your kids occupied while both parents are working from home can be a challenge. To that end, there was a disagreement in my home on Friday. That led to this small Mickey Mouse suitcase (pictured) to be placed by the front door. I asked mom, what's this all about? She said, Sam is running away. So I asked my son, where are you going? He defiantly said, I'm going to Hawaii. I thought, wow, at least he has good taste. So I asked him what he packed for his journey and he showed me the contents of his suit case. Inside were his beloved Pokemon cards, a stuffed animal and some snacks. Seems he was amply prepared.All of this got me thinking about someone close to me who is moving to another role within our great company. They are so very excited about the new role, but all the while making sure that we're prepared as they transition on. In what will likely be one of our final touch points, it is clear this person is running to something and not running from something. So for those of you who are curious about what became of Sam? Well it didn't work out for my wife and I. He decided to stay after all. I guess he realized it's not so bad here after all. ˜ #leadershiplessons #familyfirst #investinpeople",MISC,national holiday,,,Shachella,James,CenterPoint Energy,Utilities,Vice President Infrastructure and Technology Services at CenterPoint Energy,208,12,0,1mo,,,,"Shachella James, PMP likes this",Likes,,2024-03-27 04:04,3/27/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,4:04 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,220,Engagement,4am-5am,March 2024,

She continued leading and building. We did the same. Our team has been working incredibly hard to build and deliver the best Strategic Revenue Operations service we can, to align with CROs and help drive real results in the businesses we serve.We've racked up some wins, some amazing clients, and grown a lot, literally and metaphorically. As we pursue this vision, to drive revenue efficiency across the entire revenue engine, from marketing to sales to customer success, we needed help to take it to the next level. They say timing is everything in life. Mallory and I recently revisited conversations and this time, she said yes to our offer! In addition to her wealth of experience across RevOps, Mallory grew up in marketing and MOPS, bringing critical skills and experience to make our team and our offering more well rounded and more holistic. As I said, I'm beyond ecstatic about what this means for our clients, for the next iteration of our service, and for the content we will continue to deliver to the RevOps and revenue leadership community.We will likely have many more announcements to come as we work on and roll out new offerings and new content for this amazing community we're so fortunate to work with!¸",MISC,Job Seeking/job announcement,,,Drew,Bernstein,LLR Partners,Private Equity,"Director, Revenue Operations",150,15,0,1mo,,,,Drew Bernstein likes this,Likes,,2024-03-27 02:29,3/27/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,2:29 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,165,Engagement,2am-3am,March 2024,

I have learned and grown so much throughout the process, I have connected with a ton of helpful individuals, and despite it all I am no closer to employment.At the end of the day, what is my takeaway? I have wasted priceless hours of time and energy, catering documents to jobs I'm over qualified for, only for recruiters to spend 10-20 seconds looking at them and then kicking me to the side.Do I blame them? No, not all of them at least. The market is over saturated and with applicant pools being that large, it's the only way for them to do their job.My mental health is at the lowest point it's ever been in my life. The constant rejection, while not even necessarily about my skills, has left me feeling hopeless and unwanted.Unlike many, I am extremely fortunate to have someone by my side consistently pushing me forward and telling me to keep my chin up, that my time will come.Thank you Aubrey for being my daily cheerleader and reminding me that my experience is valuable, I am valuable, and that the right position is out there waiting for me to find it.Thank you Tim for continuing to provide advice, experience, and perspective. Your candor and humility are a refreshing reminder that there are people who help others for no other reason than because they are a good person.My LinkedIn network is small, but my community of unemployed veterans is huge.

I'm incredibly grateful for the chance and am hoping to participate again next year if Truist will have me!While we didn't come first in the pitch competition, all of the Green Team members came first in my heart; such an amazing experience to work with all of these skilled and hard-working individuals. It was also amazing to have real-time support from individuals from each of these companies as well as #TeamTruist staff.

The last two years have been a period of incredible transition for me, both personally and professionally. I am incredibly grateful for the support of my friend and manager, Rachel Spasser, as well as my friends on the Operating Team. This apple is not falling far from the tree. I am excited to be joining Basware, the Accel-KKR company I have supported most in my time with the firm. As Basware's new Chief of Staff I will be working across the firm to help drive value from strategic initiatives. Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by. I look forward to sharing more about this journey after I make my transition.

I have learned so much during my time with the firm, working with and learning from some of the very best in Private Equity. And I enjoyed supporting many great portfolio companies on their own journey from good to great. The last two years have been a period of incredible transition for me, both personally and professionally. I am incredibly grateful for the support of my friend and manager, Rachel Spasser, as well as my friends on the Operating Team. This apple is not falling far from the tree. I am excited to be joining Basware, the Accel-KKR company I have supported most in my time with the firm. As Basware's new Chief of Staff I will be working across the firm to help drive value from strategic initiatives. Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by. I look forward to sharing more about this journey after I make my transition. For now, I'd like to say another big thank you to friends and colleagues at Accel-KKR and its many portfolio companies for an amazing couple of years. Thank you AKKR, it's been a joy!Team Basware....

This was done through partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), IHG Hotels & Resorts, Verizon, and Wicket. The students had opportunities to meet with leadership from each company and get hands on guidance as they worked through building solutions and presentations on ideas to provide a frictionless payment process throughout a stay at a resort. With Shannon Vanderhill, MFA, Mike DeYoung and Spencer Hawkins I had the privilege of leading the 7 students on the UNCC Green Team: Ayisha R., Ruthvika Kosuri, Fred Schuck, Riona Adela, Cody Barry, Deepthi Meher, Trinity Wells and Tharun Kumar Reddy Vattam Reddy Vet. This was a rockstar team and took no time to start collaborating together, dividing and conquering the work. They listened to everyone's suggestion and prompts and factored it all into their solution and presentation.   Our team quickly envisioned and built a mock-up for a very innovative vacation planning/booking solution and estimated the cost to run it in the real world as well.  If we had had a few more hours they would have built a working prototype. All of this was accomplished in under 8 hours or working time on the project across two days. The innovation, courage, energy, and passion these students brought with them was inspiring, and made ""working"" on a Saturday worth every second.   Learning it was my birthday, the team even sang happy birthday to me at the conclusion of the event on Saturday.  I have no doubt everyone on this team will go on to great things. Perhaps some will come to work with us at Truist.  I look forward to seeing what these students choose to pursue.  If you get the opportunity to hire or work with them, do so.  You won't regret it. Thanks again to Eric Fender for masterminding the event and allowing me the opportunity again be part of these events and support university learning experiences where I can share my knowledge and experiences to help drive new ideas and solutions. #TruistImmersiveLearning",MISC,,,,Michael,Senuta,Truist,Banking,Head of Innovation and Partnerships at Truist,63,10,3,1mo,,,,Michael Senuta celebrates this,Reaction,,2024-03-28 06:30,3/28/2024,Thursday,Thursday,6:30 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,76,Engagement,6am-7am,March 2024,

As one of our Fellows, Jasmine Baten partnered with World-Wide Lighthouse Missions, strengthening partnerships with local businesses and other organizations to advance the non-profit's work in addressing hunger and those in need. During her fellowship, she helped provide life necessities for countless Connecticut residents, initiated a recycling program, and even assisted in establishing a corporate volunteer program to allow others the opportunity to make a positive impact.

Before one of the lectures late in the quarter, the students were anxious about their final projects, exams, internship interviews, visa applications & everything else that goes with being a business school student. I could feel the tension and this phrase just came out of my mouth. Maybe it helped a few of them. I think it did “ everyone calmed down & we got to work.™ˆ ™‰ ™ Multitasking is a myth “ it's been scientifically proven.  As humans, when we think we're multi-tasking, we're just task-switching, and task-switching is expensive.When you're on a Zoom with a customer, focus on that customer. When you're preparing for the next big meeting, turn off email & Slack and get it done. When you're exercising, don't check messages. When you're sleeping, put your phone in airplane mode.Close the door. Don your headphones. Block your time.” Focus on Now, now.

But is the game really fair? Not yet. But when we all do our part, I personally believe it can and will be. And there are inspiring examples. One comes from the company I joined two years ago: During my interview process, my son fell sick at home and had a crisis right in the middle of my third Zoom interview. I remember feeling like I had blown my chance at the job. However, my interview partner surprised me by showing understanding. She explained that one of the company's core values is being open and true to ourselves, acknowledging that being a parent doesn't stop when work begins. She kindly offered to reschedule, but I requested a couple of minutes to calm my son (and myself) before continuing the interview. That moment of support stuck with me throughout the process, and when I was offered the job, it was one of the reasons I said yes. The company I'm proud to be a part of is Logitech.Thinking about this experience recently, it reminded me about the pivotal role culture plays in creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed, included, and valued ” where all people get a fair chance to truly flourish. I feel this way about Logitech's culture. At the heart of it - like for any culture -are its people. It's up to all of us to inspire inclusion and ensure that no one feels left out. Individually and collectively as teams, allies, ERGs etc. If you want to drive change, you need to take action. Every small step counts. As the saying goes, ""If you are not actively including, you might be accidentally excluding."" Let's support, uplift, and empower one another, not just today, but every day.

But is the game really fair? Not yet. But when we all do our part, I personally believe it can and will be. And there are inspiring examples. One comes from the company I joined two years ago: During my interview process, my son fell sick at home and had a crisis right in the middle of my third Zoom interview. I remember feeling like I had blown my chance at the job. However, my interview partner surprised me by showing understanding. She explained that one of the company's core values is being open and true to ourselves, acknowledging that being a parent doesn't stop when work begins. She kindly offered to reschedule, but I requested a couple of minutes to calm my son (and myself) before continuing the interview. That moment of support stuck with me throughout the process, and when I was offered the job, it was one of the reasons I said yes. The company I'm proud to be a part of is Logitech.Thinking about this experience recently, it reminded me about the pivotal role culture plays in creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed, included, and valued ” where all people get a fair chance to truly flourish. I feel this way about Logitech's culture. At the heart of it - like for any culture -are its people. It's up to all of us to inspire inclusion and ensure that no one feels left out. Individually and collectively as teams, allies, ERGs etc. If you want to drive change, you need to take action. Every small step counts. As the saying goes, ""If you are not actively including, you might be accidentally excluding."" Let's support, uplift, and empower one another, not just today, but every day.

Today, I am grateful that our firm recently hosted our inaugural LBT+ Summit, where trans voices were elevated. It's an important recognition of International Trans Day of Visibility, and I wish Lola was here to celebrate with us. At our summit, we heard from inspiring trans individuals who shared their experiences and insights. It was a reminder that there is still much work to be done, but also a celebration of the progress we've made.

Her reply, 'It would be brilliant to see Mo Salah play for Liverpool'. Now 'Mo' is her favorite player and to see him live would be her dream come true. Well, what is a son to do! When Mum asks, she gets! This weekend I flew to England to help make that dream come true. Joined by Steve, Ali, Emily and Lucy, we had the pleasure of taking Mum to that game. Liverpool won 2-1 and who scored the winning goal for Liverpool ... Mo! What a beautiful experience. Such love and joy!

I have sincerely enjoyed my many roles within the company, especially the last 9 years as the Market President in Oregon & SW Washington. Growing up on the Oregon Coast, I have been a banker in the region for as long as I have been with U.S. Bank, and its predecessor company, Yaquina Bay Bank, where I started in February 1984.  I consider myself an accidental banker who turned my part-time high school gig into a truly phenomenal career.  Who knew that my family and I would eventually move five times for me to take on new leadership opportunities in Oregon, the place I love so much.  It's been a great run! Throughout my career, it has been my privilege to give back and support our community through my involvement in nonprofit, civic and professional organizations. Over the years, I've also had the opportunity to touch the lives of thousands of employees, clients, and community members with my passion for leadership, mentoring, and dedication to serving others. I like to say that bankers are dream makers and it has been an honor to help so many people achieve their most important dreams about home, business and life.  Some of my most treasured personal relationships have grown out of first meetings through my work.  It's always been about the people for me.Yes, I am retiring from my career in banking “ but not from business or a life of board service and mentorship. I plan to continue my corporate and non-profit board leadership into retirement. I'll take this summer off and then, see what opportunities emerge for me in my next chapter.  Oregon is my home and I'm sticking around to do more good work in the second chapter of my life.  Oregon remains a very important market for U.S. Bank, and the company will begin an immediate search for my replacement. Fortunately, I will be around to help facilitate the transition to a new market leader.Here's to ""rewirement""!",MISC,Job Seeking/job announcement,,,Beverly,Steele,U.S. Bank,Banking,"SVP, Operations Digital & CX Leader ",1020,320,4,3w,,,https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2024/04/01/stacey-dodson-us-bank-oregon-sw-washington.html?csrc=6398&utm_campaign=trueAnthemTrendingContent&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=linkedin,Beverly Steele likes this,Likes,,2024-04-02 18:44,4/2/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,6:44 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,1344,Engagement,6pm-7pm,April 2024,

Lots of rejection, recruiters sending msgs with job descriptions that I matched 100% to and when I replied I was completely ghosted.  What I will say is, it is important to have a strong network around you.  I was getting nowhere with applying on job boards.  I was stressed and simply reached out to my network of past co-workers and boom, I got a job.  I have often stressed that I do not go into a company and decide to just be a number, clock in/clock out and then do it again tomorrow.  I commit to the job 110%.  That is not just the work that needs to be done, it is to the people as well.  Because of that approach I have almost 25 years of relationships I have built with people I worked around and with.  I have continued those relationships even after leaving jobs and that is where the true gold is.

This was back in the day where one person cared for all business customer needs that included state of the art services from what was later called a monopoly. Collections was done via manual logs and a microfiche database we called the SBC bible. My first job right out of the military was as a FINAL BILL collection representative. The company figured if you could convince a business customer to pay once they were already turned off, you could sell and lead sales teams. The rest is history ˜. The company we work for matters. I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to represent the best communication company in the world, with the internal and external people relationships serving as the glue that motivated me to come back for 15 additional years after qualifying for retirement.  I never looked at notes like this from those that left before me as a goodbye, instead I would like to say, until next time. We never end relationships; we just keep adding on to the list.  If you are on this email, and were part of the journey (or a short stint when I stepped away from the firm), you had some role in touching my career in a positive way. For one last time as an AT&T employee, remember that doing the right thing always wins and follow the Golden Rule in both your personal and professional lives. Last, I owe a very special thank you to my wonderful wife, Debbie Garza, who I owe SBC/AT&T for because we met during my first gig at work. She has truly been my partner in life. I could have never made it this long doing my thing without her by my side. Also, huge thanks to my precious daughter Alex Garza who kept me motivated to keep going. To all those I met along the way during my work journey, thank you for the time we shared together. It has always been about the people as mentioned before.

If the overwhelming majority of people care about having an excellent community, they will take care of it, which will yield both better work and better relationships. Relationships have to be genuine, not forced; at the same time, the culture of the community will have a big influence on how people value relationships and how they behave with each other. To me, a meaningful relationship is one in which people care enough about each other to be there whenever someone needs support and they enjoy each other's company so much that they can have great times together both inside and outside of work.

I still vividly remember being a bright-eyed 20-year-old graduate in the Philippines, with a dream to join the best company I knew Procter & Gamble.You may not know that I failed my 4th interview for the Marketing team in Manila and thought that my opportunity to join P&G was gone “ if I had given up then and there, this would have been a very short post! Instead, I picked myself up, tried again, and joined the Sales team. And so, P&G taught me my first lesson “ if one door closes, find another way in. To this day, I still keep my rejection letter, as a reminder of the start of my journey. Without realizing it, I became the first female Sales Manager in the Philippines! On my first day on the job, calling on small stores in the backroads of Manila, I was shown that a diverse team makes business and everyone else better. It was an exciting way to challenge social norms. I had the opportunity to demonstrate that women can be strong and resilient in jobs previously not thought to be suitable for them. I often had to tell store owners: I am not your demo girl, I am your P&G Sales Manager. Let's build your business together! If anyone told me that 35 years later, I would be leading our Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care business, have a career that took me all over the world while raising a family and 4 kids, I wouldn't have believed it. I've been blessed with incredible teams, friends, mentors, and a stack of lifelong lessons. 35 years in and looking back, here are some of the learnings I would tell my younger self, hoping that they resonate with some of you. https://lnkd.in/eibDbaeh I will always be grateful to be part of a company that has allowed me to go well beyond what I would have imagined as a young girl growing up in the Philippines.  #leadership",MISC,,,,Murat,Genc,Whirlpool,Consumer & Industrial Products,"

I have learned so much during my time with the firm, working with and learning from some of the very best in Private Equity. And I enjoyed supporting many great portfolio companies on their own journey from good to great. The last two years have been a period of incredible transition for me, both personally and professionally. I am incredibly grateful for the support of my friend and manager, Rachel Spasser, as well as my friends on the Operating Team. This apple is not falling far from the tree. I am excited to be joining Basware, the Accel-KKR company I have supported most in my time with the firm. As Basware's new Chief of Staff I will be working across the firm to help drive value from strategic initiatives. Over the last two years I have watched as Basware has stepped out of the shadows to claim its rightful crown as the undisputed leader in Invoice Automation. Under Jason's leadership we have added many exciting hires to an already outstanding Basware team, including many good friends and former colleagues from over the years. Basware's journey is only just beginning and I simply could not let the chance to be part of something this special pass me by. I look forward to sharing more about this journey after I make my transition. For now, I'd like to say another big thank you to friends and colleagues at Accel-KKR and its many portfolio companies for an amazing couple of years. Thank you AKKR, it's been a joy!Team Basware....

Not because it looks like the competition is running scared (although, let's be honest, that can be fun too), but because if the goal of introducing water in aluminum cans was to help reduce plastic usage in an effort to save the planet, then the result of Liquid's Death's considerable efforts (and subsequent success) is that a major water producer has just been ""encouraged"" to follow suit. HUGE win for the planet.2. I discovered this image via a LinkedIn post today and, to be honest, wasn't sure if this was an April Fool's Day prank or not.

My palms are sweating with nervous anticipation. I'm not nervous that participants won't be happy or that things won't go well. I'm nervous because you don't know where the conversation will go. This is not your typical bank or fintech conference. We know that because every year our members tell us this is unlike any other event we attend. That is by design. This is not a spectator sport. Other feedback we receive include hard challenging unsettling and game-changing mind expanding what my whole team needs to be doing. Whether you're joining us in Nashville, here's the WHY and HOW of our meeting design that your teams should be adopting. Eric Schurr, Chief Strategy Officer at Alloy Labs member Sunrise Banks, and Todder Moning, Lead Futurist at U.S. Bank, gave a great breakdown on the Foresight Framework at SXSW. You can listen to it here on Breaking Banks Fintech Podcast if you missed it live. For those unfamiliar with Foresight, it is a 20 year old framework developed at Stanford to predict future events or trends. It follows seven steps: 1. Data Gathering 2. Analysis 3. Scenario Building 4. Risk Assessment 5. Strategy Development 6. Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment 7. Feedback Loop Eric and Todder bring the process to life in how they each adapted the framework to their bank. Here's how we infused Foresight into the Alloy Labs member meeting: Being Smart is Hard. Smart and intelligent are often used interchangeably but they are different things. Intelligence is about capacity vs. Smart is about the ability to perform a specific task. Smart is about being able to achieve a goal faster, easier, and more efficiently. Getting smart takes effort. The amount of effort is compounded when doing it on your own. Garbage In. Garbage Out. The infamous adage about scenario planning that poor inputs lead to poor results is nowhere truer than predicting the future. In this case, garbage is not enough diversity of perspective. We don't do panels that repeat the phrases and industry norms. The echo chamber is not useful for building scenarios. Critical without Critique. We've replaced panels with all group discussions. Members serve as facilitators to stimulate conversations. Thought provoking statements evoke debates and great debates require critical thinking with an openness to being disproven.  We believe in strong opinions, loosely held.  The future starts today, not tomorrow. One of the core tenants of Foresight is the ability to influence the future through strategic choices. This meeting isn't just a bunch of talk about what could happen, it is about defining strategies and deciphering which would win or lose in various scenarios. Getting smart about the future is harder. Doing something about it is even harder. We are at the end of one era of banking. And we are starting the next.",MISC,,,,Matthew ,Smith,Webster ,Banking,Chief Digital Banking Officer,115,32,6,2w,,,,Matthew Smith likes this,Likes,,2024-04-05 23:41,4/5/2024,Friday,Friday,11:41 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,153,Engagement,11pm-12am,April 2024,

This was back in the day where one person cared for all business customer needs that included state of the art services from what was later called a monopoly. Collections was done via manual logs and a microfiche database we called the SBC bible. My first job right out of the military was as a FINAL BILL collection representative. The company figured if you could convince a business customer to pay once they were already turned off, you could sell and lead sales teams. The rest is history ˜. The company we work for matters. I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to represent the best communication company in the world, with the internal and external people relationships serving as the glue that motivated me to come back for 15 additional years after qualifying for retirement.  I never looked at notes like this from those that left before me as a goodbye, instead I would like to say, until next time. We never end relationships; we just keep adding on to the list.  If you are on this email, and were part of the journey (or a short stint when I stepped away from the firm), you had some role in touching my career in a positive way. For one last time as an AT&T employee, remember that doing the right thing always wins and follow the Golden Rule in both your personal and professional lives. Last, I owe a very special thank you to my wonderful wife, Debbie Garza, who I owe SBC/AT&T for because we met during my first gig at work. She has truly been my partner in life. I could have never made it this long doing my thing without her by my side. Also, huge thanks to my precious daughter Alex Garza who kept me motivated to keep going. To all those I met along the way during my work journey, thank you for the time we shared together. It has always been about the people as mentioned before. Signing off from the big T and looking forward to the remaining joys of life with friends and family.

Her special areas of interest are injury mechanisms and the optimization of occupant protection in all types of road vehicles.Since 1999, Suzanne has led numerous studies on frontal and side impact crash protection by placing adult and child ATDs in passenger cars, school buses and transit buses. Since the research is conducted to inform regulations, her research programs aim to investigate crash configurations and ATD placements that challenge existing regulatory requirements. For example, her research has included rear seat occupant protection of small women and children. Crash test dummy development and the evaluation of test dummy instrumentation also form an integral part of her programs.

To start a company, you need an inspiring vision that by definition has to be aspirational, he said. If your 5 or 10 year vision is exclusively a problem you already know how to solve, then you're not dreaming big enough. By definition what you want to do five years from now should appear impossible at this stage.At our last company, Krux, we used to talk about a pervasive, always-on data fabric for consumers everywhere. And then people would say, what does that even mean? My answer back then? I don't quite know yet! But that kind of vision moves people. You have to have something provocative and huge to inspire yourself.

It has been an amazing 10 years and I am thankful for the opportunities, experiences and relationships that I was able to cultivate over that time. What started as a GM role in Canada, quickly transformed into what was to be a 2-year assignment in EMEA (London), and which ultimately became a series of diverse international brand management and market development roles and projects, across multiple EMEA-APAC geographies and cultures. I am thankful to those Newell Brand leaders and partners that I worked alongside, as their trust, support and ongoing encouragement has been invaluable. The strength of Newel Brands lies with their people, and I have been fortunate to be part of it, having forged along the way, several what I hope will be lasting friendships. I wish my Newell colleagues so much success in their future endeavours. I am confident and excited to take this next step in my journey, one that will build on a foundation that my time at Newell Brands has so wonderfully prepared me to pursue.",MISC,,,,John,Bachner,Newell Brands,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Vice President, Research & Development, Baby Business Unit and Corporate Technical COE",130,54,0,2w,,,,John Bachner likes this,Likes,,2024-04-07 13:39,4/7/2024,Sunday,Sunday,1:39 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,184,Engagement,1pm-2pm,April 2024,

I joined Guild six years ago, driven by the opportunity to work for a company focused on transforming what greater access to economic advancement in this country can look like. Today, I'm proud to carry that mission forward in a new capacity, working with the incredible people, employers, and learning partners that make this mission possible. Read more about that here: https://lnkd.in/gFcp7aUr We are at a unique moment in history and have a special opportunity in front of us.Changing demographics are shrinking our labor pools while skills gaps, exacerbated by rapidly changing technology, risk leaving millions of people ” and businesses ” behind. We must embrace this challenge head-on, building a workforce that evolves to meet the talent needs of the future, and supports the economic advancement for millions of people and their families. I am coming to my new role with a deep, personal understanding of what realizing our mission can mean. Growing up as the daughter of two Indian immigrants, I saw firsthand the challenges my parents faced navigating rapid change: The turbulent waters of the 1980s oil industry crash and the 1990s data entry automation boom. Their experiences underscored a stark reality that immensely talented people often need more resources and guidance in adapting to evolving work landscapes.I've benefited from the guidance of mentors who recognized my potential and took chances to invest in my future. With these bets, I've experienced the transformative power of education and skill development. This journey instilled in me a profound belief in Guild's mission and its immense potential for unlocking your workforce.I want to thank a phenomenal team that has ” and will continue ” to drive our work forward. That includes Guild's executive team, Alana Brandes, Rebecca Biestman, Rohan Chandran, Terrence Cummings, Chris Garber, Dan Haley, Jonathan Marek, and Marty Martinez, as well as the 1,000+ Guilders who bring their fierce intelligence and commitment to our mission every day. I also want to thank Guild's Board of Directors, including the visionary and resilient Rachel Romer, for allowing me to carry Guild's mission forward. Along with the executive team, they have all rallied behind me in the last seven months in incredible ways.Finally, I want to acknowledge my friends and family for their steadfast support, particularly over the past several months, as I unexpectedly went from 3-months postpartum after my second child to the role of interim CEO overnight.In particular, I want to give a special shoutout to my partner-in-crime Amit Shah. Amit encouraged me to embrace the opportunity to lead and step up ” and there is no world in which I would be embarking on this next phase, carrying this critical mission forward, without his support, guidance, and reassurance. I am honored and excited to step up and help Guild further its impact and mission.",MISC,,,,Aarthi,Murali,M&T,Banking,Chief Customer Experience Officer,3802,427,16,3w,,,https://tinyurl.com/2m8vtmu2,Aarthi Murali likes this,Likes,,2024-04-07 12:32,4/7/2024,Sunday,Sunday,12:32 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,4245,Engagement,12pm-1pm,April 2024,

A great leader creates an environment that is safe and welcoming, where individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or retribution. When people feel secure enough to raise their hands, admit their mistakes, or ask for help, it shows that the leader has created an atmosphere of trust and respect. Employees who work in an environment of fear become preoccupied with protecting themselves from the forces within the company instead of helping the leadership protect the company from external influences. Leaders who prioritize creating a safe and supportive environment where people feel empowered to take risks and innovate build stronger and more resilient teams that are better equipped to face challenges and achieve success.Check out our new Amazon Best Seller, Unlock The Hidden Leader, Become The Leader You Were Destined To Be, by simply clicking the link below.https://geni.us/4JmlQU#leadership #management #leadershipdevelopment #employeeengagement #leaders #people #leadershipfirst #leadershipfirstquotes #executivesandmanagement #inspiration #giffordthomas #entrepeneurship",MISC,Leadership,company branded asset,,Rob,Cruz,City National Bank,Banking,Senior Vice President - B&IS Operations Innovation & Delivery Manager,39713,659,4587,2w,,,,Rob Cruz likes this,Likes,,2024-04-10 16:39,4/10/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,4:39 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,44959,Engagement,4pm-5pm,April 2024,

To continue to pursue these objectives, I am pleased to be joining Valor Capital Group as a managing partner. I will be spending a couple of days per week in this role, in order to give it the proper attention it demands, while providing me flexibility to pursue other passions of mine. I couldn't be more thrilled to work with Cliff Sobel (former Ambassador to the Netherlands and Brazil), Scott Sobel, and the rest of the Valor team. I have known Cliff and Scott for 25 plus years, and they are close friends. Valor is focused primarily on the LatAm region of the world, and is one of, if not the leading VC in that part of the world with ~$1.4B in AUM, and ~120 companies in their portfolio. Valor's ability to bring both diplomatic and economic assets to the region is spurring cross border trade between the US and the LatAm region, and that is a large positive force for our country and the Americas region. This is more important than ever as companies look to expand near-shoring in Mexico, Brazil and other LatAm countries. I'm eager to dive in with the Valor team and do all I can to make a difference, and work with their portfolio companies to maximize their growth potential and value, and contribute to economic development throughout the region.https://lnkd.in/gqa6uW6M",MISC,,,,Neel,Chopdekar,Cigna,Healthcare Payers,COO Technology,826,35,2,2w,,,,Neel Chopdekar likes this,Likes,,2024-04-10 21:04,4/10/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,9:04 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,863,Engagement,9pm-10pm,April 2024,

Being honored at the #TickledPinkLuncheon alongside Nelda Luce Blair, Chree Boydstun, Shelley Reeves Boyer, Cheryl Creuzot, CFP®, J.D., LL.M. MBA, Evelyn Leightman, and Sue Smith, was a powerful reminder of the gratitude I have for everyone who supported my healing journey and lifted me up when I needed it most. Seeing these beautiful warriors be celebrated was a fierce visual of the impact we each can make every day by sharing our stories, raising awareness, and supporting one another through whatever life may throw our way. I have endless gratitude for my support group, some of whom are pictured here, who were with me every step of my cancer journey. My medical team, family, friends, Airswift, and my community all showed up in great support. THANK YOU!!! My advice? If you're facing cancer, take things one day at a time. Surround yourself with positive people and find your way to accept the help from those willing to give it. When you can feel the love pouring out of those around you, it helps you heal.  If you know someone who is going through cancer treatment, reach out to them and offer your companionship. During the luncheon, Arif Kamal MD, MBA, Chief Patient Officer at ACS, shared that 60% of cancer patients report being lonely. A simple phone call, text, visit, or outing can make a world of difference “ it did for me. After four surgeries and the long road to recovery, I am now cancer free. Why? Because we caught it early enough thanks to my annual screening and because of the people who surrounded me. Today, I am stronger than ever. A year ago I asked you to get your screenings. Today, I am asking you again. #CEOsAgainstCancer #WeAreAirswift #ACS",MISC,,,,Shachella,James,CenterPoint Energy,Utilities,Vice President Infrastructure and Technology Services at CenterPoint Energy,366,36,4,2w,,,,"Shachella James, PMP likes this",Likes,,2024-04-10 01:11,4/10/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,1:11 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,406,Engagement,1am-2am,April 2024,

To continue to pursue these objectives, I am pleased to be joining Valor Capital Group as a managing partner. I will be spending a couple of days per week in this role, in order to give it the proper attention it demands, while providing me flexibility to pursue other passions of mine. I couldn't be more thrilled to work with Cliff Sobel (former Ambassador to the Netherlands and Brazil), Scott Sobel, and the rest of the Valor team. I have known Cliff and Scott for 25 plus years, and they are close friends. Valor is focused primarily on the LatAm region of the world, and is one of, if not the leading VC in that part of the world with ~$1.4B in AUM, and ~120 companies in their portfolio. Valor's ability to bring both diplomatic and economic assets to the region is spurring cross border trade between the US and the LatAm region, and that is a large positive force for our country and the Americas region. This is more important than ever as companies look to expand near-shoring in Mexico, Brazil and other LatAm countries. I'm eager to dive in with the Valor team and do all I can to make a difference, and work with their portfolio companies to maximize their growth potential and value, and contribute to economic development throughout the region.https://lnkd.in/gqa6uW6M",MISC,,,,Jon,Rosner,JP Morgan,Banking,"Managing Director, Head of Product",826,35,2,2w,,,,Jon Rosner celebrates this,Reaction,,2024-04-10 14:06,4/10/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,2:06 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,863,Engagement,2pm-3pm,April 2024,

While the technical and business complexity of meticulously planning such a transition was immense, everyone, including colleagues from GSK, Haleon, and our partners, did a fabulous job to make it happen.However, as I reflect, the primary reason for our success was the extraordinary leadership demonstrated by GSK and Haleon leaders, who:1)Instilled a sense of purpose to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a FTSE 20 company with a £30 Billion Market Cap.2)Set a clear strategy and ensured that every team member understood their role in executing it.3)Fostered a culture of collaboration by bringing a high-performing team together and defining clear accountabilities.4)Supported the team in the face of human errors, taking accountability as leaders and ensuring that the team learned from its mistakes.5)Defined contingency plan and ensured GSK & Haleon executive teams are aware of implications in case we need to activate it .I am incredibly proud to have been part of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I extend my gratitude to all the leaders and colleagues at GSK , Haleon and our partners who made the seemingly impossible, possible.Line De Decker Teri Lyng Joe Touey Amy Landucci David Venter Kelly Ellis Fraser MacFarlane Suzanne Ellis Agam Upadhyay Will W.#TransformationalLeadership #GSK #Haleon",MISC,national holiday,,,Amy,Lucci,3M,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Chief Information and Digital Officer, Health Care Business",281,46,0,3w,,,,Amy Landucci loved Joe Toueyâ€™s comment on this,Liked a comment,,2024-04-12 20:27,4/12/2024,Friday,Friday,8:27 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,327,Engagement,8pm-9pm,April 2024,

My son Blake Smith was a 1st-year walk-on and didn't see much court time last season, but that didn't dampen our enthusiasm one bit. Fast forward to 2024..due to a few unfortunate injuries, my son's number was called. He was brought off the bench - agreeing to forgo his redshirt and an additional year of playing eligibility - to help secure an end-of-season 8 game stand to help the team make the NCAA tourney for a 2nd consecutive year. And he certainly rose to the challenge with his defensive prowess guarding some of the best players in the Big10. By the 1st round NCAA tourney regional in Brooklyn his story was written; a few of the headlines: Northwestern's Blake Smith an Unlikely March Madness piece and This Germantown AcademyGrad Had No D1 Offers and Now He's About to Play in the NCAA Tournament. After an overtime win in the 1st round against last year's Final Four Cinderella team, Florida Atlantic, up next was UConn. Northwestern's Cinderella dream came to an end at the hands of the eventual overall tournament champs. Fun fact “ Northwestern was the only team to win a half against UConn! After Brooklyn, my interest shifted to DJ Burns with his magnetic play and infectious smile. But, then came the women: Dawn Stanley (a University of Virginia alum) took the South Carolina women to a perfect season and a championship.  And Caitlin Clark beat every record that could be broken. I found myself scheduling my time around the women's matchups. I'm always sad to see March Madness end but always leave inspired. This year, it ˜hit different'. To see my son Blake shine and the women get their turn was magical.  As we encounter continued divisiveness, thank you to the college athletes who put their will and their dreams on full display to deliver something magical every March that brings us together. Shout out to all the amazing current and former student-athletes (Larry Smith Blake Smith, Alexis Smith, Tony Watkins). And Shout out to the women.

I had met Thomas last year at the Data master Class by Dr. Alexander Borek . He gave a keynote speech there that I found extremely insightful - I got a lot out of it. I wanted to get more tips like he had presented there. So, I bought his book. If you are working in data (and one of the main points of the book is - who isn't nowadays???) then this book is defos a recommended gem. My favourite chapter: Change Management. Especially loved the graph below, though it got me reflecting about all the projects I have done in the past. And I think I would add a (at least one) component which is: ""Show some results fast; some lighthouse project"" - else it's difficult to keep the momentum.

Many world monuments will be lit up in blue lights to show support for the cause. Colorful ribbons and pins will be worn and emotional sentiments will be plastered all over social media. Unfortunately, the concept of awareness is simply not enough. Without acceptance and inclusion, none of this actually makes a difference.As the father of a wonderful 19-year-old young man with autism, every day is Autism Awareness Day for us. All of us possess special talents. However, while many have proclaimed the benefits of diversity, society has created stereotypes and cultural obstacles that actually impede the inclusion of neurodiverse individuals - those who view the world differently than us. We need to value these individuals because of their differences, not in spite of them.Acceptance and inclusion of individuals with autism needs to happen more than one day a year.#diversity #inclusion #autism #disabilitysupport #love #understanding #neurodiversity",MISC,national holiday,,,Keith,Watson,United States Steel Corporation,Consumer & Industrial Products,Vice President - Advanced Manufacturing Technology and Capital Projects,39,0,2,3w,,,,Keith Watson likes this,Likes,,2024-04-12 13:28,4/12/2024,Friday,Friday,1:28 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,41,Engagement,1pm-2pm,April 2024,

Most CIOs are juggling just a handful of application platforms across their line of business”those epicenters of major business processes like order-to-cash, purchase-to-pay, recruit-to-support, you name it.So, for many of the application companies in their early stages, maybe it's time for a more grounded positioning approach. Instead of aiming for the stars with the ""platform"" label, why not focus on staying true to our roots as a ""solution to a problem buyers are actively trying to solve. As long as that problem is big and widespread, positioning around it hits home with buyers, avoiding the  perception gap issue. Now, if the problem isn't big enough, it's a whole other TAM/SAM challenge.And if you're considering hitching your wagon to one of those flashy ""Platform"" companies, do yourself a favor: chat up 1 or 2 late-stage prospects they've recently lost (if you can pull it off). It's like a buyer's perception polygraph test”a true glimpse into how your dream company is really perceived out there.Because, at the end of the day, we are What Our Buyers Think We Are. #positioning #PMM #GTM",MISC,,,,Mark,McCarthy,KKR,Private Equity,"Operating Executive, Principal",178,23,1,1w,,,,Mark McCarthy likes this,Likes,,2024-04-13 02:39,4/13/2024,Saturday,Saturday,2:39 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,202,Engagement,2am-3am,April 2024,

As a Sikh, I would like to share the story and how it reinforces the principles of #equality and #freedom of faith.On the Vaisakhi day of 1699 (the first day of the month of ˜Vaisakh' in the Sikh calendar), Guru Gobind Singh Sahib, the tenth Guru, formalized the concept of Saint-Soldier by introducing the Amrit ceremony (the formal initiation ceremony). He transformed the Sikhs into a family of soldier saints, known as the Khalsa Panth.The Guru requested the Sikhs to congregate at Anandpur on Vaisakhi. According to the Sikh tradition, he asked for a volunteer who was prepared to give his life for his faith to come into the tent. One came forward, whom he took inside a tent. The Guru returned to the crowd alone, with a bloody sword. He asked for another volunteer and repeated the same process of returning from the tent without anyone and with a bloodied sword four more times. After the fifth volunteer went with him into the tent, there was confusion and unease among the crowds. The Guru returned with all five volunteers, all safe. He called them the Panj Pyare (five beloved ones) and the first Khalsa in the Sikh tradition.Each of the initiates was instructed to keep the five K's: Kes (uncut hair), Kangha (a small comb), Karra (an iron bracelet), Kachera (a white undergarment), and Kirpan (a small curved sword of any size, shape or metal).The title of Khalsa refers to people whose life and spirit are solely the property of the One Universal Creator and not of any king, dictator, or even a messenger of the Creator. The Sikh faith was founded on the idea that there is only one Universal Creator and that all people are therefore equal, regardless of their religion, gender, ethnicity, color, caste, or other attributes.All five of the men were then seen emerging with the Guru, each wearing an orange suit and bib. These colors are symbols of Sikhism. In a novel and distinctive ceremony known as pahul, which Sikhs now refer to as the baptism ceremony known as Amrit, he baptized the five. Then the Guru asked those five baptized Sikhs to baptize him as well. This is how he became known as Guru Chela both teacher and student. Then he proclaimed that the Panj Pyare, also known as the Five Beloved Ones, would embody the Guru himself: ""Where there are Panj Pyare, there am I. When the Five meet, they are the holiest of the holy."" Thus with these principles, he established Panth Khalsa, the Order of the Pure Ones.",MISC,,,,Jeff,McMillan,Morgan Stanley,Banking,Head of AI,1336,88,33,1w,,,,Jeff McMillan likes this,Likes,,2024-04-13 20:03,4/13/2024,Saturday,Saturday,8:03 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,1457,Engagement,8pm-9pm,April 2024,

As a Sikh, I would like to share the story and how it reinforces the principles of #equality and #freedom of faith.On the Vaisakhi day of 1699 (the first day of the month of ˜Vaisakh' in the Sikh calendar), Guru Gobind Singh Sahib, the tenth Guru, formalized the concept of Saint-Soldier by introducing the Amrit ceremony (the formal initiation ceremony). He transformed the Sikhs into a family of soldier saints, known as the Khalsa Panth.The Guru requested the Sikhs to congregate at Anandpur on Vaisakhi. According to the Sikh tradition, he asked for a volunteer who was prepared to give his life for his faith to come into the tent. One came forward, whom he took inside a tent. The Guru returned to the crowd alone, with a bloody sword. He asked for another volunteer and repeated the same process of returning from the tent without anyone and with a bloodied sword four more times. After the fifth volunteer went with him into the tent, there was confusion and unease among the crowds. The Guru returned with all five volunteers, all safe. He called them the Panj Pyare (five beloved ones) and the first Khalsa in the Sikh tradition.Each of the initiates was instructed to keep the five K's: Kes (uncut hair), Kangha (a small comb), Karra (an iron bracelet), Kachera (a white undergarment), and Kirpan (a small curved sword of any size, shape or metal).The title of Khalsa refers to people whose life and spirit are solely the property of the One Universal Creator and not of any king, dictator, or even a messenger of the Creator. The Sikh faith was founded on the idea that there is only one Universal Creator and that all people are therefore equal, regardless of their religion, gender, ethnicity, color, caste, or other attributes.All five of the men were then seen emerging with the Guru, each wearing an orange suit and bib. These colors are symbols of Sikhism. In a novel and distinctive ceremony known as pahul, which Sikhs now refer to as the baptism ceremony known as Amrit, he baptized the five. Then the Guru asked those five baptized Sikhs to baptize him as well. This is how he became known as Guru Chela both teacher and student. Then he proclaimed that the Panj Pyare, also known as the Five Beloved Ones, would embody the Guru himself: ""Where there are Panj Pyare, there am I. When the Five meet, they are the holiest of the holy."" Thus with these principles, he established Panth Khalsa, the Order of the Pure Ones.",MISC,,,,Punit,Mahajan,Morgan Stanley,Banking,Head of Analytics,1336,88,33,1w,,,,Punit Mahajan likes this,Likes,,2024-04-14 13:19,4/14/2024,Sunday,Sunday,1:19 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,1457,Engagement,1pm-2pm,April 2024,

It shows you value your team by actively listening to their concerns, feedback or suggestions. I sometimes wonder why companies ask their employees for their feedback when, time and time again, they never listen to what their employees are saying. I can remember during many meetings I attended, the routine was always the same coming to the end of the meetings, anyone have any suggestions, feedback or questions for the management team? the CEO always asked. So many people always voice their concerns or offer some form of suggestion. Still, nothing came from any of it; I can distinctly remember watching the managers at the front table when people were talking, and no one seemed remotely interested in anything anyone was saying. It was so glaring and so disrespectful. But you know what was ironic? I've heard some of these same managers complain that my employees won't speak up and label them as bad or uncaring employees, but these same leaders should look in the mirror and ask themselves how their people ended up that way. When someone is sharing their ideas and feedback, and they are not taken seriously, at some point, that person will become very quiet, and the worst thing for any organization is when their most passionate employees become quiet.Check out our new Amazon Best Seller, Unlock The Hidden Leader, Become The Leader You Were Destined To Be, by simply clicking the link below.https://geni.us/4JmlQU#giffordthomas #leadershipfirst #leadership #executivesandmanagement",MISC,Leadership,Illustration,,Brandy,Brown,Wells Fargo,Banking,"SVP, Digital Product Management Director",15753,268,1915,1w,,,,Brandy Brown loves this,Reaction,,2024-04-17 21:38,4/17/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,9:38 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,checked,17936,Engagement,9pm-10pm,April 2024,

I started at Dell in 2000, left for a few years and came back in 2011. I have worked for this company over a total of 18 years in Austin Texas, Sydney Australia, Auckland New Zealand, London UK, and Atlanta GA. The decision was not an easy one, as I feel I am leaving a lot of friends and family behind, but one I need for my own personal and career growth. I have worked for, with, and alongside some amazing people over the years. To the first leaders as an ISR, Rob Argabright and Bart Arnold to those that helped me adjust in Australia: Lida Lazzari, Mark Voorhies and Tom O'reilly, to the ones that hired me back into the business in 2011 and moved me to the UK in 2017, Kyle Dufresne and John Green. Those that made the move to the UK easier, David Mckeown and Varry McMenemy, to those that were constant support and mentors Jim Molasky and John Baxter. Thank you! Dell has some of the best people. Looking forward, I am excited to be joining a company where all my knowledge and expertise will help the growth and trajectory of the future. I am excited to be working for Brian Wright and RC Damle where I believe I will be able to make a huge impact here in the Southeast for. Zscaler.

This 20-21 April I will be participating my 12th Face of America, an inspiring, two-day, 100+ mile bicycle and hand cycle ride to the historic Civil War battlefields of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. This annual ride from national non-profit World T.E.A.M. Sports honors our adaptive military veterans and includes nearly 200 veterans, active-duty military and civilian participants with injuries and disabilities ranging from amputation to paralysis to blindness to post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury.Held annually since 2006, the Face of America is one of the largest non-competitive bicycling events in the mid-Atlantic region. In 2018, more than 600 riders participated in the ride - many of who traveled from across the United States and Canada to Washington and Valley Forge. I would like to ask you to support me in this year's ride through your generous financial donation. Each able-bodied participant is riding in support of the adaptive veterans, raising money to cover the costs for the ride, and to support upcoming events from non-profit World T.E.A.M. Sports. Donations and sponsorship funding provide opportunities for military and civilian athletes with disabilities to join remarkable outdoor adventures. These remarkable events range from the annual Adventure Team Challenge in the high Rocky Mountains of Colorado to the Coastal Team Challenge along Long Island, New York, where developmentally-disabled teens and young adults paddle sea kayaks on a two-day journey. At all World T.E.A.M. Sports events, persons with disabilities participate at no cost.As a registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, contributions to World T.E.A.M. Sports are tax deductible, provided you meet the IRS criteria and maintain certain records. (A relatively simple explanation of IRS requirements can be found at IRS Tax Tip 2010-60). World T.E.A.M. Sports sends donation receipts to all contributors to aid in this process. For questions regarding the tax or legal aspects of your donation, I encourage you to contact your legal or tax adviser.https://lnkd.in/eA6Pcfmr",MISC,,,,Jeff,McMillan,Morgan Stanley,Banking,Head of AI,399,23,18,1w,,,,Jeff McMillan likes this,Likes,,2024-04-18 14:59,4/18/2024,Thursday,Thursday,2:59 PM,,,,,,,,,checked,,440,Engagement,2pm-3pm,April 2024,

To make training as easy to leverage as possible, document the most common questions and answers through audio, video, or written guidelines, and then assign someone to organize them and incorporate them into a manual, which is updated on a regular basis.Principles themselves are a form of leverage--they're a way to compound your understanding of situations so that you don't need to exert the same effort each time you encounter a problem. #principleoftheday",MISC,,,,Michael,Senuta,Truist,Banking,Head of Innovation and Partnerships at Truist,2014,83,133,1w,,,,Michael Senuta likes this,Likes,,2024-04-19 09:08,4/19/2024,Friday,Friday,9:08 AM,,,,,,,,,checked,,2230,Engagement,9am-10am,April 2024,

One of the key messages from the fabulous Archie Deskus was about the importance of relationships.That was clear from the moment I arrived. The HoustonCIO community has accepted me as one of their own. Rob Franch and I were reflecting on how challenging it can be to relocate a family to a new and somewhat foreign place. We both grew up as leaders in Chicago and were part of the ChicagoCIO community. Armed with that knowledge and experience, we are building relationships here in #Houston with so many talented and experienced leaders who have welcomed us.If I only heard the keynote and had the opportunity to speak with Rob alone, it would have been a great day. What made it an exceptional day was I got to meet with a client who was also being recognized. Ralph Owens, congratulations and thank you for the partnership. In another illustration of how these relationships we invest in span beyond a professional level, I had the opportunity to catch up with Dave Upton. We both share a passion for home theater. Congratulations Dave on winning in our category. I can't think of anyone better to represent us.The icing on the cake was the opportunity to be seated at the same table with Lise Monahan. Lise and I were part of the office of the CIO at another company. Under the leadership of Jake Dominguez, we learned and we grew since. It was great to catch up with Lise and celebrate her recent successes and promotion. I'm still in awe to be able to be considered in a group that reflects the best of the best. It's always a huge honor to represent Jack Henry, my team and our community. Thank you all for the opportunity and the investments you continue to make in me. In particular my wife Julie Zelinka, PMP, SP, PSM I who has been along for my journey almost from the very beginning.

This year you will even go to New York to host a fireside chat with another she-roe Phyll Opoku-Gyimah. And that's another thing - your identity will help you find a job that you are passionate about. You will use your lived experience to make sure workplaces are as inclusive and safe as possible, for everyone to be free to be themselves.

According to Unbridling Your Brilliance, humility is rooted in a desire to serve and a dedication to helping others become great. Never confuse humility with weakness; in fact, it takes great strength of will and character to put the needs of others before your own, admit your mistakes, and be vulnerable, transparent, and fallible in front of your team.True humility is rooted in the desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others. It involves viewing ourselves as part of a larger community and recognizing that our actions, no matter how small, can have a significant impact on the world around us.

tu as bien raison 🫣
c'est complètement faux je ne remplis pas moi même les bouteilles

Yesterday's announcement of the FTC rule against non-competes is a step in the right direction, but it is not the same as a federal law. The FTC rule can be contested in court or changed as the administration changes. We continue to work toward a more durable solution, which would be a federal law banning employment non-compete agreements across the country.

Instead, the vision of what you are trying to achieve will pull you towards it, motivating you to keep going and pushing yourself further. This is because when you are passionate about your work, you are more likely to feel a sense of purpose and drive, which helps you to overcome any obstacles that come your way.

It's encouraging to see so many women in influential sustainability positions in large global companies across the world.

Anna Robertson, Debra Everitt McCormack, Francesca Mahoney, Leah Borgeson Stigile, Margaret Egan, Gayle Schueller, PhD, Jayme Smoot, Faith Taylor, Kate Williams, Kim Dabbs, Monica Batchelder, Maya Colombani, Virginie Helias, Bea Perez, Nancy Mahon, and so many more!

They care about taking ESG to the next level with collaboration and cooperation on a new scale.

They're embedding ESG within their organizations and across a broader business ecosystem.

They face a myriad of challenges: 
- Consumers are reluctant to change their behaviors and stakeholders at all levels are disengaged
-  Suppliers are siloed and innovations are not being adopted across the value chain
-  Local policies are fragmented, disrupting efforts to improve sustainability at scale
-  Leaders and employees lack the skills to build a more collaborative business ecosystem

But they are leading with pragmatic optimism. They are accustomed to complex challenges and the need to meet people where they are at. They are able to see the forest and the trees to create meaningful long term goals and important daily targets.

Like me, they love hiking with their kids and pets. They love science and well tested theories of change. And together we can accelerate the pace of change and intensify our efforts to maximize their scale and impact long term.

Let's build more capacity to lead change through developing changemaker skills in our employees, customer and communities.

Let's design multi-level ESG solutions that address root causes and are engineered for widespread impact and scale from their inception. 

Let's foster growth and ignite engagement through shared decision making  so that the promise of circular economy can be realized today, not tomorrow.

Let's empower collective collaboration across a broader business ecosystem through mutual respect and reciprocal resources so that innovations and efficiencies can be translated into social and financial value without delay.

I am confident about the future with sustainability progress in these women's hearts and hands.

And I understand the sentiment, that Teams/Zoom meetings are not a full substitute for face to face connection. 

But also, I disagree. You CAN build genuine relationships with people you’ve never met in person. 

This is me and my good friend Amy Rummel, MBA. Up until this week we’d only ever met via Teams meetings, hundreds of them over nearly 4 years. All with camera on, making time for small talk and getting to know each other, our interests, our families, our life outside of 3M. 

The distance between our homes (London, Ontario vs Derbyshire, UK) made a face to face coffee kind of challenging. 

But we still built a great working relationship, challenging and coaching each other and creating award winning training programmes together with our global team.

And we also developed a beautiful friendship, which was joyously cemented this week over actual coffee, real life trips to English pubs and a short Derbyshire road trip when Amy came to the UK on business, and made sure she passed by my house. 

When we fully utilise tech platforms like Teams without forgetting the basic principles of human interaction - keep your camera on, your body language positive, show interest in your colleagues as people, not just fellow employees… you can build working relationships but also friendships that transcend geographical boundaries and time zones.

She organized a group of 103 students and chaperones from her elementary school to pack at FMSC Coon Rapids for her passion project. 🙌 With the help of her teachers, Leah talked to the principle, helped to arrange buses, did a slideshow, rounded up permission slips and counted the people coming to the packing session.

Together this group packed 19,656 meals, enough to feed 54 children a meal every day for an entire year! 🍚 When asked why she chose FMSC, Leah responded, ""Because I want to help people.""

Before going to the interview, it's wise to write your own version of the job description with OKRs, maybe even share it with the hiring manager. Negotiating on salary/comp, budget, resources, and support are the four pillars of negotiation, which you highlighted.

“You’d want to go not just to the places you knew there was activity and cows — you want to go to places where at least there’s no reported bird flu”, Webby said in The New York Times. 
 
The FDA continues to monitor the spread of bird flu in cattle, with the latest turn in the story showing fragments of H5N1 in roughly 20 percent of retail milk samples in a national study. However, live virus has not been found in any samples and regulators have found no evidence that milk poses a danger to consumers because the pasteurization process inactivates the virus. 
 
Although there is no cause for immediate concern, eradication is important because sustained spread among cows would give the virus time to acquire mutations that could make it transmissible among humans. The outbreak among cows remains a low threat, as cows are not exhibiting symptoms of H5N1 and are recovering. https://bit.ly/4bfpD8e

Our teams have the opportunity to spend valuable in-person moments connecting and ideating on ways to “do more for more” in the communities we serve.
 
“During our time together, we’re focused on the ‘ripples’ that this company started 50 years ago in one zip code in 1975. Those ripples led to hundreds more zip codes in hundreds of communities across the country,” said Help at Home’s CEO Chris Hocevar. “Our journey is just getting started. Thanks to all those who have paved the way to today to spending thousands of hours daily caring for the most vulnerable populations. And, thanks to all of our employees in this room, our admin staff and our 50K+ caregivers, clinical teams and Community Health Workers across the country in advance for all of the ripples we’ll create together in the future.”
 
“Personally, I’m amazed by the passion and energy our caregivers and staff bring to their jobs every day. It’s that part of our culture “to do more” that’s just so impactful to our clients and to the communities we serve,” said Help at Home’s President Tim O'Rourke.

Where the reputation of the company is guarded and protected by the entire HMTX family, being the industry standards for innovation, quality, performance, and design. 

A company succeeds when people value each other, they play to their strengths, they care for each other, and they collaborate to win, and I found that in HMTX. A family-owned industry leader headquartered in Norwalk, CT and recognized the world over in the flooring and home improvement industry. Its customers and millions of consumers have placed their trust in its incredible portfolio of brands and reinforced that with numerous accolades for innovation, supply chain performance, online excellence, and customer partnership.

Check out the teaser for this week's episode of ""Thought Leaders: In their own words.""

I had the incredible opportunity to explore the inner workings of The INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati through the lens of its COO, Ashlyn Bhatt and Executive Director, Keith Koehne.

Theirs is an #org committed to increasing and diversifying the number of young people who choose a #tech pathway.  Oh, it's also an org run completely by 14-18 year olds...so, there's that.

In our teaser I ask Ashlyn:

""What is the biggest myth that adults have around young people and technology? What are we getting wrong?""

You're gonna wanna hear her response!

Be sure to tune in tomorrow for the full conversation 📣

While the U.S. Chamber of Commerce challenged the regulation, Pure Storage offers a different perspective. 

Since 1941, California has made non-competes unenforceable, except in certain situations such as key executives in the sale of their company. A highly competitive labor environment is one important reason why this State remains the world's fifth-largest economy, which is significantly enabled by the absence of non-compete agreements. 

In our early days, Pure Storage faced a barrage of non-compete lawsuits from a large entrenched vendor, which did not want its people leaving for a competitor. Certainly, seeing trained personnel go to a competitor is uncomfortable, and employees certainly need to protect confidential information. But, competitive hiring works both ways and companies need to create attractive and competitive workplaces to retain their top talent. 

To create a competitive economy and world beating companies, our country needs to enable a mobile, competitive workforce. Eliminating non-compete agreements will enhance our country’s competitiveness, and encourage companies to focus on their work environments rather than their legal contracts.

For 50 years, the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification has been the standard of excellence for financial planners.  The path to CFP certification requires completion of the education requirement (up to 18 months), passing the CFP exam, fulfilling the experience requirement (6,000 hours) and a commitment to adhere to the high ethical and professional standards for the practice of financial planning.  According to the CFP Board, just 68%* of candidates passed the CFP exam during the most recent testing period, March 2024. 

The discipline and commitment required to obtain this designation is representative of Ryan, Tripp and Luke's commitment to professional development and a valuable investment in their future.  Please help me congratulate each of them on this outstanding accomplishment!

The prompts you'll use for vision models could be text, point coordinates, or bounding boxes, depending on the model. You'll also learn to tune hyperparameters to shape the output. 

Models you'll use include Segment-Anything Model (SAM), OWL-ViT, and Stable Diffusion. You'll also learn to fine-tune Stable Diffusion to generate personalized images (say, an image of a specific person), using a handful of images for training. As an example of a multi-step workflow, you'll use OWL-ViT to detect an object based on a text prompt, then pass the bounding box to SAM to create a segmentation mask, and input that mask into Stable Diffusion to replace the original object with a new one based on a text prompt. 

Controlling vision models can be tricky; this course teaches prompting and fine-tuning techniques to get precise control over their output.

STAY CURIOUS was the keynote topic. In all things in life, it is imperative we all stay curious and continue to learn!

It was more than just a meeting… it was about coming together as a team, strengthening our unity, and reigniting our collective passion. 

We connected over shared goals, celebrated accomplishments, and bonded over some epic fun times! 🎉💙

We also redefined our purpose and priorities, aligning with the 3 fundamentals of *Finance 2.0*:

1️⃣ Reinforcing the Employment Brand: We are not just a team, we are a brand that advocates integrity, expertise, and innovation.💡

2️⃣ Best-in-Class B2B SaaS Finance Team: We strive to deliver value, streamline our operations, drive efficiency, utilize technology (AI), and shape the future of finance.🌐

3️⃣ Always Be Learning: We embrace a culture of continuous learning and believe there's always room for improvement. Every challenge is a new learning opportunity. Try, Learn, Grow!🧐

It’s clear that when we connect as a team…virtually, asynchronously, or in-person… we succeed TOGETHER! Here’s to exciting times ahead. Always forward, never backwards!🚀

I joined NTT Data in 2019 as part of a multi-year growth and transformation agenda in North America. Throughout this time I thoroughly enjoyed working for one of the world’s leading Technology Services organizations, initially focused on Financial Services & Insurance clients and then over the last three years in Consulting & Digital Transformation across all industries in North America.

Every day, I sought to take the world class ingredients available there to 1) elevate the impact our work and our brand had on clients; 2) improve the value proposition for our employees and 3) drive business performance. My favorite work was bringing all of these together when we were all collaborating on what a previous CEO of mine referred to as “our best day.” 

I don’t have immediate plans. In the near term, I’ll be enjoying Spring & Summer in Chicago, traveling, playing LOTS of golf and eventually figuring out my next career step.

Arigatou gozaimasu to all my global NTT Data colleagues. I’ve enjoyed our journey immensely. I wish you all Godspeed. To all the clients that I’ve served, much continued success and I look forward to our paths crossing again at some point in the future.

As a proud member of the Confluence team, I'm thrilled to share that we are a sponsor of Expect Miracles Foundation's (EMF) Distance Challenge this May. This remarkable initiative supports vital cancer research and provides essential financial assistance to those impacted by cancer.

EMF uniquely channels efforts into:
- Accelerating cancer research at leading institutions like Dana-Farber and Memorial Sloan Kettering.
- Offering financial support to ease the burden for cancer patients and survivors.

I am personally participating in this challenge and have committed to raising $3000 to help advance this noble cause. No matter the size, every donation makes a significant impact because 100% of participant-raised funds go directly to these life-saving and supportive programs.

I'm reaching out to my LinkedIn network for support. If you can contribute, please visit my fundraising page. Your support not only helps advance crucial research and aid but also amplifies the spirit of community and hope.

Together, we can make a real difference!

Last Friday, we conducted a survey, and the winner was ""Clang-Tidy cppcoreguidelines."" I confess this is one of my favorite resources, and I use it in all my projects. But before we delve into the subject, let's first understand what the ""C++ Core Guidelines"" are.

The C++ Core Guidelines are led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the original creator of the C++ language, and include other prominent figures such as Herb Sutter, chair of the ISO C++ committee. They provide a set of guidelines and recommendations for the effective and safe use of the C++ programming language, aiming to promote best programming practices, especially concerning interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency. Such rules affect application architecture and library design. The goal is to help developers write modern and robust C++ code (specifically from C++11 onwards) that is safe, efficient, and easy to maintain.

I strongly recommend that you also use them; after all, who knows C++ better than its own creator?

Now that we understand what they are, let's examine some types of checks that Clang-Tidy provides us, based on the C++ Core Guidelines:

- cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
- cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
- cppcoreguidelines-virtual-class-destructor
- cppcoreguidelines-explicit-virtual-functions

Below, see how the code looks before and after integrating Clang-Tidy directly into Qt Creator:

Elektrownia jest obsługiwana przez Southern Nuclear w imieniu jej współwłaścicieli, w tym Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power i Dalton Utilities.

- Zakończenie rozbudowy elektrowni jądrowej Vogtle o blok 3, a obecnie blok 4, to wyjątkowe osiągnięcie dla Southern Company, stanu Georgia i całych Stanów Zjednoczonych - powiedział Chris Womack, prezes i dyrektor generalny Southern Firma.

Oprócz 800 stałych stanowisk pracy utworzonych w nowych blokach, w szczytowym okresie budowy na miejscu zatrudnionych było ponad 9 000 pracowników, w tym inżynierów, spawaczy, elektryków, monterów rur, hydraulików i wielu innych.

There won't be awards, no accolades, no money in this... no one may know the work you did. But knowing you have done your best for your patients gives you an inner satisfaction and reward greater than any on earth. 
My husband Dr. Muhammad Ahsan Iqbal, one of the finest primary care #physicians I know, always tells me this. Especially on days when I come home 1.5-2 hours later than my #workschedule, when I'm exhausted from all the patient tasks, Saturday shifts, or when I'm upset with #insurancecompanies #advocating for my patients for their #healthcare rights. We had the absolute best teachers in our residency program The Institute for Family Health one whom we speak about all the time Mark Josefski. His patient care was so outstanding rarely did his patients get admitted to the hospital. Thankfully his critical but #compassionate #precepting pruned our #medicalcare.
I often have some motivational theme song playing in my head after work. Coming home to my small children, one now 7 months old, I acknowledge that my heartstrings are pulled being away from them. On my ride home I think about one or two people I saw in the day whose lives were #transformed by meeting me. I #thankGod for the part I played.
Last week I saw a patient that astounded me. She had initially seen me asking for permanent disability/Govt financial assistance due to mismanagement of all her medical conditions by past provider systems and #hospitalsystems here. I told her I can help her with her medical problems in the meantime. I thought I was in the wrong room when I walked in seeing her wearing a suit, her hair/makeup done well, a business bag. She's working for an investment company now, and just needs more support to help her medically as she's thriving. No more thoughts of #disability. Nothing short of a miracle. She really rose up in just 5 months with her incredible #selfdetermination. She gave me a long hug to thank me for my help. I hear these stories weekly if not daily. Most patients that have never seen a #primarycare doctor in 10, 20, 30 years. All #selfpay #noinsurance .
I'm heartbroken to be separated from the #patients I love genuinely now that #WalmartHealth is closing. David Carmouche, MD I have always been that physician l that went above and beyond for my patients. Being #human, knowing them wholly with the small details of their life, caring for them as close family, and with #sincerity has always been the key. I thank my husband for being my #partner. He has more life changing #patientstories than I do. I will miss the exceptionally caring, highly trained staff I call my work family.

(True story)
I've seen some crazy backlogs.
I've seen backlogs 100s even over 1,000 items long! 😱

Here are 3 strategies to help keep your backlog short:

1️⃣ Automatically archiving old backlog items

Let's be real. 
If something has sat in your backlog for 2 years or more now, you're never going to do it! 

Set an expiry date on your backlog items. For example is something has been in your backlog for longer than 18 months it automatically gets archived.

Trust me, if it's important, it'll come back!

2️⃣ Leverage your Product Roadmap

If an item is on your roadmap and it's long into the future,
does it need to be on your backlog? 

Allow items to graduate from your Product Roadmap onto your backlog.

Keep your backlog focused largely on the near term, on the work that you've already done discovery on and have decided to build.

(More on building effective Product Roadmaps: https://lnkd.in/grfcg_33)

3️⃣ Breaking down Outcomes first

Many teams have long backlogs because they're they're still working too big. 
They break a very large initiative down into lots of backlog items.

Instead they should be trying to break down their outcome first to work small.

e.g. rather than trying to come up with every improvement idea for your product, focus on an outcome. Say improving acquisition. 

You can then break that down even smaller. 

Rather than looking at the whole conversion funnel, hone in on the worse spot (Improve experience/click-through-rate of page X)

The first is of some of our Cisco CX Americas GES Premier team earlier this year at the State Fairgrounds in RTP. Together with nearly 1,000 volunteers from 13 other companies, they made it possible to provide more than 220,000 meals for those facing hunger.
 
Volunteers sorted and prepared culturally versatile foods such as rice, lentils, and pasta, that are being distributed through the 34-county food bank network as a part of a “Sort-A-Rama” event led and organized by the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina and made possible by presenting sponsors including Cisco and Food Lion. Since 2011, Sort-A-Rama volunteers have packed and prepared 1.5 million meals for distribution to families throughout Central and Eastern North Carolina.
 
High Touch Operations Manager – Team Lead, Caroline Davis shared that, “I do this because it hurts to know that someone can’t eat.”
 
Together with Paul Bard, she has been leading and coordinating volunteer activities for CX Americas GES Premier. CX Americas GES Premier Team Leads pictured among the more than three dozen volunteers include Caroline Davis, Daphne Britt, and Mike Walsh.
 
The second photo is from an on-site volunteer day with Note in the Pocket, an organization that tackles clothing insecurity by providing quality clothing to children and families in need, improving their comfort and confidence.
 
One of my favorite things about working at Cisco is the people, and these are just a few examples of why.

Please, I am begging you, think before you send that email. Does it have a subject line that would make you click open? Even better, would your distant cousin who knows nothing about your organization want to open it?

Think about the previews that drive you to check out a new movie on Netflix. Think about what makes you curious and in need of more information. Your writing should read like a human wrote it for a friend. Not like corporate robots aligned it with brand standards and whitewashed it in flavorless cream.

Not great (generic, who cares...):
- Spring Campaign (just got this one from a place I love 😫)
- ABC Giving Day is Here!

Better (only opening if you're my top 5 favorites or if I'm hate reading):
- You can change the world!
- $10 will help 10 pets

Best (Got me curious and nosey, specific call to action):
- Great news inside! Bingo's life changed when he was rescued. See the before and after you made possible.
- This is our chance to make sure grandparents like yours experience a warm smile and a hot meal every day. See how you can make a difference.

Keep an eye on your open rates and what is working. Don't be afraid to try something new! You've got this!

Living some of the lessons I try to share — from the value of trust to overcoming failure — is something I strive to do each and every day. It's the ability to share and work through these lessons with so many people that gives me the drive to keep pushing forward and grow as a leader.

Some key takeaways:
1. Use the “3Ds” framework to make better decisions for your org:
a. Discover: Collect individual opinions independently before group discussion and then share these with everybody prior to the meeting.
b. Discuss: Compare perspectives within the group, focusing on understanding points of disagreement rather than building consensus.
c. Decide: Make decisions independently post-discussion to minimize group influence.

2. Incorporate the word “nevertheless” into discussions, especially when making decisions or addressing disagreements. It acknowledges the other person’s perspective while affirming your decision or stance.

3. Replace confrontational language like “I disagree” or “you’re wrong” with phrases like “I don’t understand” so everyone feels heard and valued. If people feel heard, they are more likely to feel like they contributed to the decision, even when they disagree.

4. Use pre-mortems to set kill criteria. Before starting a project, imagine failure and what early warning signs might have predicted it. Commit in advance to reassess or pivot if you notice those red flags later on. This makes it easier to walk away when sunk costs and overconfidence bias loom large.

5. Know that if you’re considering quitting, it’s likely overdue. Uncertainty, sunk costs, identity, and ownership effects conspire to make us persist with failing efforts longer than we should. We wait for incontrovertible proof to quit. If quitting crosses your mind, examine if you’d start the project today given what you now know.",MISC,,,,Franscisco,Trejo,Caterpillar,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Head of Global eCommerce, CAT Digital at Caterpillar Inc.",410,29,22,3w,,,,Francisco Trejo likes this,Likes,,2024-05-02 16:45,5/2/2024,Thursday,Thursday,4:45 PM,blob:https://www.linkedin.com/6439751f-b9d0-418f-9d39-cfd34ddc1ce1,,,,,,,,,,461,Engagement,4pm-5pm,May 2024,checked

Instead, it is about empowering and inspiring people to achieve great things. A great leader understands the strengths and weaknesses of their team; they encourage and motivate their team to strive for excellence while providing them with the support and guidance they need to succeed. A leader knows that anything is possible when people are united and working towards a common goal, and they use this belief to inspire others to reach for their highest potential.

In this post, I'll highlight Eleta Hillyer.

Eleta is my only ""official"" direct report.  Eleta started her career at Walmart Health and the Center Administrator in our Walmart Health in our Springdale, AR center.  Let me tell you, being a CA in NW Arkansas, 10 miles from the Home Office, is no picnic.  Eleta and her team was the first recipient of every new big idea we had.  Some were great...others not so much.  Eleta led her team through all of these tests with a positive attitude and a smile (most of the time) on her face. 

In 2022 I had the privilege to bring her to my new site opening team.  She adapted so quickly to the task at hand it was amazing.  In this past year, she, with support from Alicia Johnson, BSHA created our first ever comprehensive Center Administrator onboarding program.  She worked closely with our Annie Hughes Patterson, Erin Edminister Hollingshead, Melissa Walsh, MBA and our associate communications team to develop a comprehensive new center marketing approach to reach both internal and external audiences.

In August of last year, as I assumed a leadership position within the central operations team, Eleta readily took on the vast majority of the new site opening program.  Together, with our support team from Sevan Multi-Site Solutions, she drove the program to open the sites we had the privilege of opening this year. 

Eleta is highly adaptable, smart, passionate, and meets my number one criteria...she is a good human.

Shame on us if we blow it - this is our last chance.” – stated Peter Sena, President of Southern Nuclear yesterday at #SMR2024.

The panel session focusing on navigating innovation: streamlining regulatory paths for advanced reactor licenses highlighted the importance of avoiding delays and staying ahead of the curve when it comes to regulation and licensing methods. 

Here’s what are experts had to say:

🎤Michelle Catts, MBA, SVP Nuclear Oversight, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, “We need over 3,000 reactors, and if we started deploying those operationally by 2030, this means 167 reactors per year coming into operation. So how do we actually get there? We’re not going to get to 2050 without some real streamlining of licencing guidelines. A lot can be done on the industry side and the government side. So there’s the “why”. 

🎤Doug True, Chief Nuclear Officer and Senior Vice President of Technical and Regulatory Services, Nuclear Energy Institute “If you look back at the history of what has delayed nuclear power in the past, it’s not nuclear safety but environmental reasons - we have to keep the door open for public to engage and have lots of opportunities to do that.”

I'm sharing some CEO experiences in a few short stories, hoping you'll find a worthwhile nugget or two. Here's story #7.

My most frequent mistake as a CEO was slow personnel changes.

It’s hard to let someone go—I believe that with enough coaching, anyone can improve, and there’s risk with every departure. They may not be perfect, but they know where the data is, they have the customer relationships, they know the daily flow their job requires. Worst of all, I’ve often really liked the people I had to fire.

But here's the hard truth: 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤—it's more complex and energy-consuming than we anticipate. Sometimes you just have to recognize when it simply isn’t the right fit. They aren’t bad or incompetent, they are just in the wrong place. Getting fired might even be the best thing that could happen to them.

𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐠𝐮𝐭. I’ve learned that if someone's natural strengths don't align with their job, no amount of coaching can bridge that gap. A creative soul may never thrive in the rigid world of data, just as someone whose likes the big picture may struggle with the minutiae demanded by their role.

It’s tough letting someone go, but it’s rarely a mistake – for you, or for them. I’m still personal friends with many people I’ve fired, and they’ve gone on to be successful in roles that were a better fit for them.

So I offer this advice when it comes to firing: do it with kindness, do it with professionalism, but most importantly, 𝐝𝐨 𝐢𝐭 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐲. The courage to act, to make those tough calls, is what leadership often boils down to. And it’s a skill I wish I had honed much earlier in my career.",MISC,,,,Roy,Rosas,Golden Gate Capital,Private Equity,Operating Executive,106,11,1,1mo,,,,Roy Rosas likes this,Likes,,2024-05-02 11:15,5/2/2024,Thursday,Thursday,11:15 AM,,,,,,,,,,,118,Engagement,11am-12pm,May 2024,checked

1. Commitment to Care: Our approach at Walmart Health emphasized accessibility, price transparency, and integrated services. We became a healthcare haven for many who felt overlooked by traditional systems. It was an honor to support our patients’ health and wellness journeys.

2. Exceptional Team: The dedication of our health center providers and associates, along with the relentless support from our home office team, were nothing short of extraordinary. This commitment reminds me of my time in the military, where every individual plays a crucial role in a collective mission.

3. Advocating for Change: The challenges we faced underscore the broader issues within our national healthcare system, which requires a fundamental overhaul. We need a model that prioritizes quality and outcomes, ensuring economic alignment with these goals.

The lessons learned at Walmart Health are invaluable. I have no regrets about our innovative approach and remain passionate about transforming healthcare.

Meet Sonia Syngal, Former CEO of Gap Inc..

Born in India, Sonia and her family immigrated to Canada at a young age.

Surrounded by creativity, Sonia showed an early interest in fashion at a young age. 

By the time she was 12, Sonia was sewing and making her own clothes.

By her teenage years, Sonia was making prom dresses for her friends. 

Despite her love for creativity, Sonia pursued a more stable path in engineering.

In 1988, Sonia moved to the US and enrolled at Kettering University, where she studied mechanical engineering.

Immediately, she started working at Ford Motor Company.

By 1995, Sonia graduated from Stanford University with a Master's in Engineering.

That's when Sonia took a leap into the dot com boom and joined Sun Microsystems as a Senior Director of Manufacturing.

After a decade, the facade of Silicon Valley wore off and Sonia decided to make the transition into her childhood dream: fashion.

By 2004, Sonia joined Gap Inc. in Global Supply Chain.

By 2011, Sonia was promoted to Managing Director of Europe.

By 2013, Sonia was promoted to SVP of Supply Chain.

By 2016, Sonia was promoted to CEO of Old Navy.

During her three year tenure, Sonia grew Old Navy's sales from $7B to $9B annually.

Then in 2020, it happened. 

Sonia was promoted to CEO of Gap Inc., the country's largest specialty apparel retailer. 

She became one of only 3 women of color CEOs on the Fortune 500.

Then, catastrophe hit.

Within 48 hours of becoming CEO, Sonia had to take over 10,000 employees to shelter in place during the pandemic lockdown.

Then, Sonia had to figure out how to furlough 100,000 employees across the continent. 

Overnight, The Gap lost 70% of our revenue, leaving the $16 billion giant with only eight weeks of cash at their burn rate.

Sonia calls it, now affectionately, her ""Apollo 13 moment"".

Fortune named Sonia one of the most powerful women in business in both 2021 and 2022.

Sonia went on to lead the retail giant through the pandemic and shutdown,  retiring soon after.

When asked about her time as CEO, Sonia's advice is clear: get a mentor.

Sonia shares that Scott McNealy, former CEO of Sun Microsystems, provided great support to her over the years. She believes that your direct and former bosses are often the best mentors.

Today, Sonia spends her time mentoring younger professionals. 

Sonia's number one rule when looking for a mentee?

""I don't like whiners.""

Sonia's incredible ride to the top is a testament to hard work.

Yet, you hardly ever hear about her story.

In fact, I bet this post might be the first time you've ever heard of Sonia.

That's why I'm going to be sharing the stories of more women execs & founders like Sonia every Wednesday for #WomenFounderWednesday.

For those of you not familiar, it's a pretty big deal :) #SpoilerAlert, I earned my APR on April 20th! 

With the help of Matt Knight, APRᐩM Elizabeth Whittington, MBA, APR and Kim Marks Malone, APR, Fellow PRSA, I kicked off the process in January. It culminated in a small, windowless conference room with me passing the 171-question, three-hour, thirty minute computer based examination which was every bit as challenging as it sounds. Along the way, I presented to a panel highlighting the research, planning, implementation, and execution that went into the launch of the #RoamingGnome marketing campaign from my days on the PR team at #Travelocity. Thanks to Kim Cherry, APR and Beth Wilson, MBA, APR for your participation on my panel!

As professionals, we're lucky to have a few moments like this over the course of our careers. I've been extremely fortunate to have crossed paths with many, many elite communications professionals and even luckier to have learned from and been mentored by the likes of Dan Toporek, Al Comeaux, Helen Vollmer Caudle, Teri Daley, APR, and Judy Cohen.

Reflecting on this time, I am grateful for the #DreamTeam I work with every day, proud of our accomplishments, and energized for what’s ahead. 

From launching the inaugural #FSYachts venture to creating a Commercial organization, we’ve learned some valuable lessons that have allowed us to #BeLegendary. Here are the top 3: 

1. Be Bold – By taking creative risks, attracting new guests, and entering new markets and lines of business, we’ve achieved our ambitious goals in stride.

2. Be Brave – Creating a Commercial organization took trust and confidence, but the success that followed proves that taking that leap of faith was worth it.

3. Foster Belonging – At Four Seasons, a meaningful sense of belonging is deeply connected to our approach to luxury. Our legendary culture and dedication to The Golden Rule are fueled by the 50,000+ kind and caring individuals that make up Four Seasons. Our people are the key to our success. 

Cheers to 3 years and here’s to many more with the #LOVEFourSeasons family! 🥂

Reflecting on this time, I am grateful for the #DreamTeam I work with every day, proud of our accomplishments, and energized for what’s ahead. 

From launching the inaugural #FSYachts venture to creating a Commercial organization, we’ve learned some valuable lessons that have allowed us to #BeLegendary. Here are the top 3: 

1. Be Bold – By taking creative risks, attracting new guests, and entering new markets and lines of business, we’ve achieved our ambitious goals in stride.

2. Be Brave – Creating a Commercial organization took trust and confidence, but the success that followed proves that taking that leap of faith was worth it.

3. Foster Belonging – At Four Seasons, a meaningful sense of belonging is deeply connected to our approach to luxury. Our legendary culture and dedication to The Golden Rule are fueled by the 50,000+ kind and caring individuals that make up Four Seasons. Our people are the key to our success. 

Cheers to 3 years and here’s to many more with the #LOVEFourSeasons family! 🥂

I didn’t know how crucial they are to our environment and in the fight against climate change. Last week I got to visit and learn more about how unique mangrove swamps are as I visited the South East coast of Thailand.
 
Their role in purifying water, providing breeding conditions for most species of tropical fish, absorb massive amounts of carbon, and pump oxygen into our skies is mind blowing. They even provide a natural barrier to the erosive powers of the ocean and provide economic opportunities for the local communities.
 
All in all, Mangroves simply ROCK!

In this post, I'll highlight Eleta Hillyer.

Eleta is my only ""official"" direct report.  Eleta started her career at Walmart Health and the Center Administrator in our Walmart Health in our Springdale, AR center.  Let me tell you, being a CA in NW Arkansas, 10 miles from the Home Office, is no picnic.  Eleta and her team was the first recipient of every new big idea we had.  Some were great...others not so much.  Eleta led her team through all of these tests with a positive attitude and a smile (most of the time) on her face. 

In 2022 I had the privilege to bring her to my new site opening team.  She adapted so quickly to the task at hand it was amazing.  In this past year, she, with support from Alicia Johnson, BSHA created our first ever comprehensive Center Administrator onboarding program.  She worked closely with our Annie Hughes Patterson, Erin Edminister Hollingshead, Melissa Walsh, MBA and our associate communications team to develop a comprehensive new center marketing approach to reach both internal and external audiences.

In August of last year, as I assumed a leadership position within the central operations team, Eleta readily took on the vast majority of the new site opening program.  Together, with our support team from Sevan Multi-Site Solutions, she drove the program to open the sites we had the privilege of opening this year. 

Eleta is highly adaptable, smart, passionate, and meets my number one criteria...she is a good human.

Whatever comes next for me, if I have an opportunity to bring Eleta along, I absolutely will.....so you better make your best offer before I have the chance.",MISC,,,,Margaret,Downs,Walmart Health and Wellness,Healthcare Providers,Director of Operations & Implementation,205,9,7,3w,,,,Margaret Downs reposted this,Repost,,2024-05-03 15:30,5/3/2024,Friday,Friday,3:30 PM,,,,,,,,,,,221,Engagement,3pm-4pm,May 2024,checked

In addition to all this, Carla has extensive experience in construction management.  She has an eye for detail and won't accept shoddy work.

I cannot tell you all how much that meant to me. At the request of my amazing wife, Jenny, I took the past year off and didn’t think much about work. I focused on myself, my health, and my mental well-being. In that year, I lost 75 pounds, traveled the globe to some amazing places with family and friends, built a new home, completed many projects in that new home, and ridden my motorcycle thousands of miles to see some amazing sights. 
During that time, there has always been one nagging thing, not around WHERE I will work next, but HOW I will work next. What can I do that will make me happy? 
I’ve done so much in the collaboration and workplace transformation business that it’s like second nature to me. I talk to people about collaboration solutions like most people talk about making a PB&J sandwich. It’s just something I get and truly enjoy. That’s why I’ve decided to start a business focusing solely on that. 
Officially launching today, Meeting Standards will set a new bar in collaboration experience and workplace transformation design. Bringing the absolute best solutions from major industry partners like HP, Logitech, Poly, DTEN, Microsoft, Zoom, Cisco, Google and so many others, Meeting Standards will offer custom tailored room solutions for any size business and any budget. 
I can’t express how unbelievably thrilled I am to be starting this new chapter, and more importantly doing something that I can be proud of. I was watching the Compaq documentary, Silicon Cowboys, a few weeks ago. In it, Rod Canion, former CEO and co-founder of Compaq, says he, Jim Harris and Bill Murto didn’t start Compaq to make a bunch of money, they started it so they would have a fun place to work. I’ll be adopting this motto for Meeting Standards. A “great place to work” culture is so important for the overall health of a company, and I will be putting this into practice to promote a fun and accepting place to work. 
Please follow Meeting Standards for more content from me and the team as we launch and grow this exciting new company. In the meantime, if you have any questions or want to chat, I’d love to talk more about this amazing new adventure I’m on! You can also see what we’re up to at www.meetingstandards.com

So to now be charged with a role that guides the impact and experience of all our employees at Logitech is a real privilege!

I am incredibly lucky to have wonderful support so I must give some necessary recognition to those who have had an impact on my Logitech career. 

-The incredible Kirsty Russell, a force for people and a mentor to many. The words ‘thank you’ do not seem enough for the impact you have had on the company and me. Our results will give you homage!
-Our new CEO Hanneke Faber, in the few months she has been at Logitech she has already led by example showing her commitment to internal development. Thank you for your belief and trust in me.
-Our Chair Wendy Becker, thank you for always being an encouraging voice, sharing wise words and provocations to help me grow.

Hello everyone, I am sharing that I am now Open to Work. However, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on my journey and express my pride in the transformative project that was Walmart Health.

Our founder, Mr. Sam Walton, dreamt of changing the landscape of healthcare, driven by his personal experiences with healthcare costs. He aspired to improve the situation for both his employees and customers. After all, 90% of the population live within 10 miles of a Walmart. His vision inspired us to strive towards establishing healthcare centers across the United States within our Walmart Centers.

Over the span of 5 years, we served 51 communities through Walmart Health. We reached out to thousands of patients, improved lives, educated communities, and genuinely made a difference. Each individual that walked into a Walmart Health location was impacted by the collective effort of every team member.

From the welcoming face at the front desk to the clinical staff, dental staff, Nurse Practitioners, Dentists, and Medical Doctors providing care, everyone played a part in the success of Walmart Health. Not forgetting the unsung heroes behind the scenes - those who sourced the staff, advocated for change in healthcare, negotiated terms, and all who worked under the banner of Walmart Health.

The closures of these centers are a loss, impacting patients, communities, employees, and Walmart itself. Yet, they underscore the urgent need for more accessible and affordable healthcare centers in the United States.

I am profoundly proud of the work we accomplished, of being a part of this remarkable initiative, and of our collective effort to revolutionize healthcare.

A special thank you goes out to the amazing recruiting team and leaders. We changed lives, we made a significant impact, and you should be incredibly proud.

For anyone in healthcare looking to hire dedicated, patient-focused professionals, I encourage you to connect with the administrators of the Walmart Health centers and meet the staff. Please also consider the many talented individuals from Walmart who are now entering the job market that worked behind the scenes. They are exceptional in what they do, and I firmly believe they will be an asset to any organization.

Thank you for my time with Walmart, and I look forward to the next steps in my professional journey.

We are grateful to Chris for his service and ask God’s blessings on him as he begins a new and exciting chapter in his life. #veterans #wounded #Soldier #Army #nonprofit",MISC,,,,Beverly,Steele,U.S. Bank,Banking,"SVP, Operations Digital & CX Leader ",47,5,3,1mo,,,https://www.pinalcentral.com/maricopa_monitor/news/army-vet-receives-home-near-maricopa-for-his-service/article_c460c915-40f7-5bad-bc5b-cced2dfec33a.html,Beverly Steele likes this,Likes,,2024-05-04 21:33,5/4/2024,Saturday,Saturday,9:33 PM,,,,,,,,,,,55,Engagement,9pm-10pm,May 2024,checked

Most of Comerica Bank's Technology Team is based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, USA.  Given the location of my home in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, I do not go to the office every day, but I do go to the office on the occasions where there is value to be gained from in person collaboration.  It is a 5 hour drive.  Most people would just assume that I would always work from my home 100% of the time, but I don't.

This week I spent three days in Michigan that were extremely valuable to me and Comerica.  It was an important moment to come together to solve difficult business problems that required strong team collaboration.  As one of our collaborators highlighted, ""we accomplished in 3 days what we would have accomplished in 4+ weeks virtually!""  This was a great example of coming to the office for a moment that matters.

While I was there, I had the secondary benefits of informal discussions with members of our team, a mentoring session, a 1:1 with my leader, and the wonderful art that the Take Your Children to Work participants created on my office wall.  All human-to-human engagements that were enriched by the value of in-person collaboration.

I am not saying that we must come to the office every day, but we cannot expect that working 100% remote is the best tool for the job for every task.  We have to look at the office environment as an enabler in our tool bag that can be used to effectively solve problems.  Ask yourself this question every morning, ""Are you working from the best location today to maximize your effectiveness to do your job?""  If the answer is no, then it is time to get in the car, on your bike, or on the transit, and move yourself into the work location that maximizes your productivity and efficiency.  Your willingness to choose the work location that maximizes your productivity and efficiency will ultimately increase the quality of your output and the value contribution to your organization. 

I acknowledge that I have an extreme commute of 500km or 300 miles, but most of you reading this do not have a 5-hour drive to the office.  The vast majority are likely well under an hour on a bad day.  Therefore, making the right decision for maximizing value when you ask yourself, ""Are you working from the best location today to maximize your effectiveness to do your job?"" is even easier than mine.

Value is a key contributing factor when assessing your readiness for future roles on your career journey.  We should all be looking to maximize our ability to deliver value.  Don't ignore the value that being in the office can create in your productivity and efficiency, particularly during collaborative work activities.

For me, the commute this week was worth it as it maximized the value that we delivered this week.

And so 18 months before NYC 2025 I’m putting down a solid effort. For a long term goal. 
Running the 6 major marathons - of which I’ve done 2 (Chicago and Boston). 

And I’m excited that even though I’ll have to wait on the long term goal, it’s meaningful to me to make strides on it now (pun intended!). 

What long term goals do you have that you are committed to and consistent for right now?
How do you maintain your motivation? How many strategies are you using?? When motivation wanes (and it does a lot for long term goals), what systems, habits, and frameworks do you have in place to stay consistent?

Let’s go!!

…I landed with a visa and two suitcases at New York’s JFK airport. My family followed shortly after and we started our life here in New York. 

While I still learn on a daily basis, I have seen and learned so many things in the last ten years. And I would like to share a few of those. Not to be pretentious, just to add some things that might be new or different insights for some of you. 

1. Unbias yourself. 

Believe systems can narrow the solution set too quickly. Keep an open mind for different and new ideas.

2. Transparency builds trust. Trust builds alignment. Alignment builds success. 

It’s a simple success formula that really works. If intentions and actions are transparent, then we will trust each other. And when we trust each other, we will align on the intended outcomes and all our energy flows to a common goal. Instead of wasting energy on politics or second guessing….

3. Your culture is defined by the worst behavior that you are willing to accept. 

Every time someone on your team or organization does or say something that could harm your culture or ethical standards, you have a choice to make as a leader. If you let it go, you have lowered the bar of your culture. If you say/do something about, you maintain the standard that you have set as a team…

4. When you want people to build a boat, make them long for the sea. 

Freely translated from a french writer. It’s a about crafting a vision, an aspiration that gives people a sense of purpose and direction. And therefore we will build the boat, instead of giving them the command. Don’t get me wrong, in certain cases a command is the only way yet it’s so much easier when people execute by self-motivation:-)

5. The hospital process worked, but the patient still died.

Meaning, following the process is not enough. Don’t hide behind the process. Instead dive into the content, understand the real risks and ask the right questions to make informed decisions. 

6. Careers are not only built on successes. They are also built on failures and crises and how you deal with these. Own it up, blameless post-mortems, root cause analysis, discover the learnings and apply the learnings going forward. 

Thank you all for the great ten years! To be continued….",MISC,,,,Brandy,Brown,Wells Fargo,Banking,"SVP, Digital Product Management Director",5896,377,104,3w,,,,Brandy Brown likes this,Likes,,2024-05-05 07:49,5/5/2024,Sunday,Sunday,7:49 AM,,,,,,,,,,,6377,Engagement,7am-8am,May 2024,checked

When you do hard things it can be easy, once through it, to just move on and actually sweep the effort under the rug. 
This doesn’t serve a healthy self regard. 
Knowing what gets you to and through hard things is what defines your strengths AND encourages you to give attention to those things when the next hard thing comes along.

I enjoyed the conversation and the opportunity to share lessons I’ve learned throughout my career and what makes a successful leader – be authentic, act with integrity, communicate effectively and demonstrate strong business acumen.

These women had insightful questions about how to navigate challenges and grow in their careers — we’re lucky to have these ambitious leaders on our teams!

Thank you Terry for the invite!

I just spent an amazing week together with my colleagues from around the globe at our 2024 Leadership Conference, discussing Ball Corporation’s winning strategy and aligning around our vision and goals (and maybe partying a bit as well).♟️📈🥳

I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this great organization, and I’m sure we’re gonna continue kicking butt and taking names. 💪🏼🚀😎

Congrats and thanks to everyone who made it happen! We had some amazing moments of sharing, learning, volunteering, doing some really cool workouts, dancing and most importantly connecting/aligning as a team! 🙏🏼🫶🏼

Like many climbing the career ladder, somewhere along I bought into the notion that securing and holding onto coveted leadership roles meant sacrificing parts of myself. As a Latina in the C-suite, the loneliness alone was challenging enough. When you add the relentless demands of COVID, social unrest, economic uncertainty, interpersonal tensions, and continuous organizational turmoil, the pressure wore me out.

Yet, a persistent voice inside me insisted, ""Burnout isn't a mandatory badge of honor in leadership. There's a different way forward, and it's not just for you!""

Deep inside I knew that to lead others with compassion, clarity and intention, I had to first apply those principles to myself. Writing increasingly became my method for making sense of my experiences. And the process of writing what would evolve into my forthcoming book, Burnt Out to Lit Up: How to Reignite the Joy of Leading People, became the balm I needed.

Through my writing, I came to grips with the fact that, though I was far from my best self, thankfully, my best self hadn’t given up on me. I hung onto the hope that we could patch up the tattered edges of modern leadership and steer a fresh course—one fueled by intentional, compassionate, and courageously pragmatic leadership, all while crafting creative ways to support today’s workforce.

Writing Burnt Out to Lit Up was, and continues to be, my path to healing. It has served as both my medicine and my muse. As I wrote down my experiences to help others reignite their leadership spark, I found mine flickering back. Unpacking the layers of past leadership mistakes, unavoidable setbacks, and the heartaches endured through years of relentless change strengthened my resilience and led me to actionable, research-backed tools and strategies crucial for transforming individuals and organizations.

I’ll share more about Burnt Out to Lit Up in the months leading up to its release in September. For now, I leave you with what inspired me to write, what sustained me through the process, and what I’ve gained from it. If, as Bethany Saltman advises, you have a story you can’t stop talking about, and as I've discovered, a calling that tugs at your heart, exploring it through writing might not only be your own path to healing but also a balm for others.

I’m not nearing a breakdown. I’m not falling apart at my keyboard. I’m not completely overwhelmed and exasperated. I have been feeling the pressure of work, my honey-do list, kid’s activities and early spring farm work all building up. The to-do lists keep building. 

Younger Steve would have put his head down and just worked his way through it, potentially leading to frustration or overwhelm. Older Steve is learning that to stop getting deeper in the hole you occasionally need to put down the shovel. I can be more proactive about releasing building pressure rather than needing to be reactive to fixing a breakdown. It is easier and faster to maintain your tools than to repair broken ones. 

Things I will NOT do today:
-         Check my phone (and I have turned off my notifications)
-         Watch the news, YouTube or other distracting videos
-         Consume a bunch of comforting junk food or drinks (sugar is my nemesis)

Things I will do today:
-         Be present in the moment
-         Spend time talking with my wife
-         Exercise in the sunshine
-         Eat a bunch of healthy nutrient rich food that I prepare at home
-         Read for a couple hours
-         Keep myself hydrated (a personal challenge as I tend to be pretty camel-like)
-         Finish re-facing my deck and get that task to ‘done’

There is no judgement in this list – these are the things that I know personally recharge me and allow me to reset my systems.

Hospitals get to essentially write off their bad debt, but physicians don't - supposedly because they're ""nonprofit"" and engaged w serving the ""public good.""  We are literally the only US small business sector not allowed to do so.

The solution for uncompensated medical care provided by physicians always defaults back to either employment/RVU based PSAs or undervalued call contracts (if they're offered at all) - both of which center around the brobdingnag of corporatized health systems, both of which also ironically drive up the costs of care locally. 

A simpler, more holistic solution would be allowing physician practices to write off our losses for uncompensated care at Medicare rates. It would achieve a better alignment and empower independent physician practices.  I'll bet the return on this would be far better than what we have in place for the NFPs presently. I'd be curious if this would be worth studying for a health care economist Ge Bai (not that your plate isn't already full.)

A little perseverance coupled with belief in yourself can go a very long way.  I know it may sound like a hallmark card to some but believe me, it is true, because I am living proof.

What a memorable meet with Ann Marie Janke! 

As always, she is as accomplished as ever while being the CIO of Nieman Marcus. It was great catching up with her after almost 15 years. By the way, she has the exact same bright aura and a big smile😄

Why is she special to my leadership growth? She was my boss (and a great one indeed) in 2005/2006 . She left a lasting impression in my leadership journey. When I was driving to meet her, I remembered one of the meaningful leadership feedbacks she gave me during an annual review. She told me she liked my passion and intensity, but warned me not to be a “whirlwind.” I have to say…I am still working on it😊. However, that advice always worked as an invisible and silent whisper. It kept me grounded when I got anxious from things moving fast but not fast enough🤔. Reflecting on my reunion with Ann Marie, it reaffirmed the need for an enduring impact of great mentorship and actionable feedback in one’s leadership transformation journey.

I want to thank her for being that mentor for me.",MISC,,,,Brett,Brunick,Thrivent Financial for Lutherans,Healthcare Payers,"Executive Vice President, Chief Digital and Technology Officer",377,31,1,3w,,,,Brett Brunick likes this,Likes,,2024-05-05 21:10,5/5/2024,Sunday,Sunday,9:10 PM,,,,,,,,,,,409,Engagement,9pm-10pm,May 2024,checked

When I first arrived in this vibrant city, I had no connections in the area. 

I vividly remember contacting these wonderful professionals in the area and seeking their connections. The response I received was overwhelming. They graciously extended their friendship, shared invaluable insights, and welcomed me into their networks. Because of their kindness, I was able to build a meaningful and supportive professional community in the Dallas area. Thank you Asha Devasia, JJ Rorie, and Jana Gerber.

The connections I've made here will forever be cherished. #Networking and supporting one another is crucial for women's professional growth and advancement. We inspire and uplift each other by sharing our experiences, challenges, and triumphs. These connections have provided a safe space to learn, seek advice, and gain invaluable perspectives from women who have walked similar paths. The bonds formed through this powerful network have been a constant source of #motivation and #empowerment.

As I embark on this new chapter in the greater New York area, I carry the lessons, experiences, and friendships forged in Dallas. I look forward to continuing to nurture these relationships and building new ones along the way.

If you're in the greater New York area or have connections there, I'd love to hear from you. Your guidance and introductions would be invaluable as I navigate this exciting transition.

It is with the heaviest of hearts that I write this post to share the tragic loss of three amazing men in my life – Carter Rhoad, Callum Robinson, and Jake Robinson. These men embodied the essence of community. When good people know good people, love, kindness, and joy spread like crazy and that is what happened here in San Diego. I am so heartbroken and can’t comprehend this type of evil in the world, and I'm not sure I ever will, but we won’t lose hope or faith. Carter, Callum, and Jake would never want that to happen.

Today, I am asking for action from this community. We need to support three families during this time and rally around them; we’ve created three GoFundMe pages.

Stand with Natalie, Remember Carter's Impact – https://gofund.me/5e1b14d6
We've created this GoFundMe page for two purposes…The first is to rally support for Carter’s wife during this unimaginably difficult time and provide essentials such as housing, food, transportation, and more. The second is to honor Carter by raising money for scholarships and donations he felt passionate about. No donation is too small, and every contribution is deeply appreciated.

Rhoad Family Expenses - https://gofund.me/858cdfeb

Robinson Family Expenses - https://gofund.me/a703b630

If you can't donate, please consider sharing these pages with your community.

So many people ask me how they can get on boards…sometimes it’s this simple: 
 
A year ago, Michael Rempell mentioned to Stacy Berns (or my dear friend, Stacy Bernsita) that a pet company was looking for a board candidate. She recommended me because she knew I was already serving on boards AND she knows that I am passionate about my farm and animals. That information was shared with Peter Cobb who graciously jumped on a phone call with me and then passed that along to the rest of the  BOD of PetMeds®  including Gian Fulgoni Leslie C. G. Campbell Diana Garvis Purcel, MBA, CPA (inactive), NACD.DC and Jodi Watson 

Since then, I’ve had a year of learning the company, under the leadership of Matt Hulett and extend my gratitude to Matt and the entire board for granting me the opportunity to serve as an independent board director. This esteemed group is driven by a mission that resonates deeply with me.

Beyond what has been written elsewhere, my professional career is rooted in the entrepreneurial spirit instilled by my parents, who had me and my siblings working in their tortilla factory from a young age. From warehouses to retail, from Texas to New York City, my path has been shaped by diverse corporate and entrepreneurial experiences. 

I've had the privilege of working for leaders who have been my strongest supporters and gave me the opportunities to grow professionally and personally: Mindy Grossman Jason Rabin Diane von Furstenberg and my former business partner Tony Melillo to name a few. And…I have so many other sponsors in my life that promote my name when I’m not in the room (the list is too long but thank them all). 

I’ve had people who have “mentored” me without knowing it and have had the past three years of board experiences learning from too many impressive leaders to name. What I can tell you is that I continue to learn from every experience and have been able to round out my skills to be a better leader and operator because of each and every experience. 

I’ve lived the roller coaster ride of retail over the past decades of transformations. Building relevant and profitable businesses, finding white space opportunities, and centering everything around the ever-evolving consumer is what drives me to succeed.

I didn’t think my personal passions and my professional life would intersect in this way but my 8 rescue horses, 2 rescue dogs, and 1 talkative senior cat at Sugar Bear Farm in upstate NY will be happy that I am helping other pets live healthier and longer lives too. 

I am truly excited to partner with the PetCareRx Inc and PetMeds®  team to foster a company that exemplifies excellence for our employees, customers, and investors alike. Now it’s time to buckle up (thanks Meahgan (O'Grady) Martin) for this fun ride ahead!",MISC,,,,Franscisco,Trejo,Caterpillar,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Head of Global eCommerce, CAT Digital at Caterpillar Inc.",782,349,16,3w,,,,Francisco Trejo celebrates this,Celebrates,,2024-05-06 06:26,5/6/2024,Monday,Monday,6:26 AM,,,,,,,,,,,1147,Engagement,6am-7am,May 2024,checked

For now, it is great not having to worry about deadlines and Teams calls, but I daresay I may be tempted to do some freelance part-time advisory, coaching or NED work at some point.

I have been privileged to have worked with many talented people over my time as a practitioner, a consultant and most recently in executive search.  The last 18 years has been a sheer joy, working with so many talented CIOs across multiple industries and geographies.  We have a rich seam of talent in our industry and the opportunity to work with incredibly able and dedicated IT professionals and to be a small part of helping companies put technology at the heart of their operations has been a real career highlight.  Little did I know 46 years ago, when I first programmed a DEC PDP 11/34 at school, that it was the start of my career in IT - it has been a fun ride!

Sprite gave beach goers the ultimate shower experience by bringing a massive Sprite machine to the beach that dispensed water for beach goers to shower.

Picture this: you're at the beach, the sun is scorching, and you're longing for a refreshing shower.

But what's this?

A giant Sprite fountain drink machine towering over the shoreline, ready to drench you in cool, revitalizing water.

That's exactly what beachgoers experienced thanks to Sprite's ingenious guerrilla marketing campaign.

It's not every day you see a beverage company take their branding to such creative heights.

But that's exactly what Sprite did with their larger-than-life installation.

Instead of just handing out free samples or sponsoring beach events, they went above and beyond to create an unforgettable experience for their target audience.

And it worked like a charm. People couldn't stop talking about the Sprite Soda Shower (both IRL and on social media), and it left a lasting impression on everyone who got caught under its refreshing cascade.

This act of showering after a long day at the beach is undeniably refreshing, just like the experience of sipping on an ice-cold Sprite. It's a perfect synergy that revitalized Sprite's brand image.

It's a perfect example of how thinking outside the box can elevate a brand from ordinary to extraordinary.

It was an honor to present the workings of the Meter Data Management team from meter reading to bill creation. Meter to cash as it is commonly referred to within the industry.
It's an extremely diverse and complex set of tools and processes having ownership with several other towers. What makes the flow of data possible - people! The flow of communication never stops, within tower or cross. My attempt here was to impress upon the audience that communication is key for any successful process. Know the impacts and know the beginning and end points in any process.
 
Thank you Kashanna E. and Karen Douglas for the opportunity!

If I told you that the three words presented during the first 1.5 seconds of your videos determine heavily the effectiveness of your advertising, would you believe? This was the question that rose to me after I joined Smartly Growth Summit a couple weeks ago and got some new ideas for testing. Specifically the idea was to test:

Would it be better to talk about (A) the retail stores nearby OR (B) a dream car for the upcoming summer? Afterwards, it’s easy to say that the latter was a lot better approach since Cost per Lead was almost -39% compared to the former.

The lesson learned once again: never take anything for granted and always test at least two different options to make better and more effective advertising.😎

Not only are they tasked with managing the intricate intricacies of human resources, but they also often find themselves shouldering the emotional weight of their organizations. 

As the frontline responders to employee concerns, conflicts, layoffs, compliance issues, and crisis management, HR leaders play a pivotal role in maintaining the well-being of both their workforce and their organization. However, this responsibility often comes at a cost to their own mental health. Many find themselves in the role of unofficial therapists, navigating complex interpersonal dynamics and shouldering the emotional labor of their colleagues.

In this webinar, we will explore the impact of these challenges on the mental health of People Leaders and provide insights into how to recognize and address the signs of burnout, stress, and compassion fatigue. We will also equip attendees with practical tools and techniques for establishing healthy boundaries, managing stress, and seeking support when needed.

There are many who are pointing to this as the failure of PE and VC in healthcare - investors made their returns, loaded it with debt until it was no longer sustainable.

While this transition is bittersweet, as I reflect on the remarkable accomplishments, the exceptional team and colleagues, and the genuine camaraderie fostered at Google, I now look forward to learning and growing in a new company and making an impact there. 

Google Networking has always held a special place in my heart. I joined in 2010 as an optical networking technologist, and from the outset, I was captivated by the heady mix of massive scale requirements, talented teams, empowerment, and the tenacity to drive bold transformations in network architecture. We fostered deep partnerships with equipment vendors and pioneered numerous industry firsts in optical transport, subsea cables, and routing platforms. Additionally, we developed groundbreaking technologies in-house, including software-defined networking, traffic management, planning and design, and network observability. Together, we built and operated one of the largest, most resilient, and most scalable global networks, serving as the physical backbone for Google's internal applications and Cloud offerings, essentially becoming critical societal infrastructure. 

It has been a true privilege to have been part of this incredible journey as both a technical and people leader. While we built an awesome network, it is more than about the nodes and links, it was the people and the relationships forged that truly made it exceptional. We shared moments of joy, overcame challenges and setbacks, and created countless cherished memories filled with laughter and, at times, tears. I am incredibly thankful to my leaders, mentors, and teammates for the ride and pride of my career.

A simple act of kindness no doubt altered the trajectory of my life.

It was the interaction that ultimately led me to choose West Point over Annapolis – and it’s a lesson in how org culture ultimately attracts or repels interested individuals.

I was a senior in high school and recruited by both Army and Navy.

I hate to admit it now, but Navy had the initial edge. My older brother was my hero growing up, and he played football at USNA’s prep school in Newport, RI.

Thus, I was pumped for my Navy recruiting trip. 

But my host, an upperclassman, kept introducing me to everyone during my visit as his “drag,” Naval Academy slang for a recruit who they had to “drag” around. He was nice enough, but pawned me off on some plebes to entertain me. I felt out-of-place, like a burden.

A few weeks later, I went on my West Point recruiting trip. The coaching staff put me up with John DiMuzio, a plebe from NJ, where I’m from.

John had a larger-than-life personality and introduced me to ALL his friends – not as his drag - but as “his” recruit. We had a blast at the hockey game despite walking in 14 in. of snow! He couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating. 

When it was time for bed, I went to lay down in the military cot that was in the room, just like I did during my Navy recruiting trip.

“No, you’ll sleep in my bed,” John said. “I got the cot.”

At the time (not true now), Navy had a more successful program. Better facilities. Better dorm rooms. Better town, restaurants, and bars (sorry Highland Falls). Better weather.

But at West Point, I ran into better people – and that’s what made all the difference.

This isn’t a slam of USNA nor a glorification of West Point – no doubt I could’ve had a much different experience during both recruiting trips.

But John’s kindness made my decision easy.

He’s no longer with us – John passed away in 2018 from brain cancer. But I think of him often, including every time I tell the story of why I chose West Point.

The whole family is going. 

My husband and I took the kids many times when they were young. 

We have great memories from our Disney trips. 

But our kids are grown now, 32 and 25….and family vacations have become fewer and fewer as they build their own lives. 

This week I was at a funeral for a friend who I grew up with. 

He tragically passed away after a simple medical procedure went horribly wrong. 

His family loved Disney too. 

In fact, through the years, we’d run into them there from time to time. 

After being witness to the shock, grief, and pain on the faces of his family….

I realized that time is shorter than it used to be. 

So, on a whim, I booked it. 

Flights too. 

Then I texted the kids the screenshots of the reservations and waited….

I thought for sure that someone would say “I already have plans that week, or I can’t get off work…”

Instead I got “OMG, I’m so excited!”  And, “I’m putting in my vacation request right now!”

I rarely take vacations. 

I’m always at work. 

But this week, I saw first hand that our time is not unlimited….

And that sometimes you have to risk being silly, spontaneous or impulsive….

While you still can. 

Take the vacation. 

Reach out to the old friend you haven’t seen in years. 

Invite the family over for dinner even if your house is a mess. 

Surprise your kids with an unexpected get together. 

Go to the beach. 

Or show up with your fishing gear or golf clubs. 

Go to the baseball game. 

Do whatever you love with the people you love 💕 for as long as you can.

Seventeen years ago, I woke as I did my previous days in Iraq. Focus on the mission at hand with my teammates; I also knew that day that I would be attending a memorial service for two young man that I did not know, but we’re part of my brigade, and her sister battalion who had been killed a few days earlier by an improvised explosive device. Part of me, wondered in the chaos if we were making a difference, if all this sacrifice was worth it. That evening, after attending the memorial service and catching up with my peers and my boss that I had not seen for several months; I headed back to my headquarters again with a heavy heart when my vehicle struck by a command, detonated improvise explosive device. I immediately knew what it was, and very quickly understood that I was severely wounded and my prayer to God was not to die in this country. He answered my prayer through my teammates, and all of the medical professionals that touched me that evening and gave me a chance to live. But I submit to you that the real miracle was not just surviving, but it was being healed. The burden of uncertainty and the fear of the unknown was lifted by my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

I am blessed and I strive to be a blessing every day. As Memorial Day approaches, I understand how close I was the being memorialized and so fortunate to be able to live a thriving life and to watch my six grandchildren grow up.

I didn’t do this by myself, I want you to understand that my faith, my family, and my friends, all too many to recognize and acknowledge, provide me hope to fight on my merry men. And I lay me down to bleed a while and will rise with you and fight again .

Good Bless!!!

Our focus topic was women and power. We laughed, helped each other find words for things we didn’t know, and left as new friends.

It compares hospital and health plan consolidation in specific markets. Indiana is a market that is deemed a high cost market (7th highest in nation for hospital costs) because of hospital consolidation per studies, yet when you look at the market, plans have more leverage as the top 3 represent 91% of the large group market. 

A few thoughts: 1) you can look at number of hospitals, but it would be better to compare commercial spend for these systems as I would imagine a lot higher than the counts indicate. Some hospitals may have a higher proportion of governmental business and that needs to be considered. 2) Based on plan leverage, one would think plans would say no to continued commercial price increases. It's important though that employers support plans in these discussions. I have seen many times over the years that employers want access above everything else, which means the plan has little leverage with the hospital to take hard line stands or risk losing large national employers who will just switch to another plan creating a vicious cycle of continued cost increases. 3) Under this environment, there is little incentive to move to VBC like arrangements vs. fee for service.

Big shout to Physician Innovation Network (PIN) at the American Medical Association (AMA) for gathering an incredible group of clinician innovators at the American Telemedicine Association (ATA)'s annual summit. 

*PIN IRL Breakouts*
I had a blast getting to know Salman Hirani, MD; Gregory Goodman, M.D.; Hansa Bhargava MD; Oren Mechanic, MD, MPH, MBA; Thomas Kim; and Eli Lourie, MD, MBI, FAAP, FAMIA. These folks are pushing innovation in specialty telemedicine (pain management, pediatrics, psychedelics, obesity) and driving progress in clinical informatics, hospital-at-home, and medical news/education. 

Thanks to Aditi U Joshi MD, MSc, FACEP; Ryan A. Grant, MD, MS, MBA, FAANS; Michal Tzuchman Katz, MD; Christina Gerdes, MD and others for attending our ""PIN IRL"" breakout sessions and sharing best practices for optimizing telehealth, the various roads (and struggles) of physician entrepreneurship, creating a healthier environment for alternative payment models (bundles, capitation, P4P) to succeed, the importance of policy and legislative advocacy, and successful implementations of technology by health systems from an informatics lens. 

*Telehealth Innovators Challenge Judging*
I was honored to be 1 of the judges of the final round as 11 startups across specialty telemedicine, remote monitoring, women's health, patient experience, and care solutions pitched in 3-mins slots. My go-to questions were ""what's the pricing, how are you acquiring customers, and how are you different from competitors?"" 

Congrats to winners:
• Kwamane D. Liddell, JD, MHA, BSN at ThriveLink (telephonic social program enrollment)
• Ryan A. Grant, MD, MS, MBA, FAANS at Vori Health (interdisciplinary virtual MSK care)
• Eric Dy at Bloomlife Inc (maternal health home monitoring)
• Noel Khirsukhani at Andor Health (hospital genAI and virtual nursing)
• Tero-Pekka Alastalo at CardioSignal by Precordior (heart disease remote monitoring)

The work they showed represents the ongoing efforts of many, many people and organizations.  There’s only so much they can cover in 15 minutes.  We had a long conversation about how #ESOPs represent our best shot at creating a more balanced economic system.  We also discussed the specific legislative support we need to make ESOPs much more common, particularly among larger businesses - but that understandably hit the cutting room floor as policy is probably pretty bad TV.  But you can check out the website for Expanding ESOPs for a preview.  And please stay tuned for developments on our legislative push.  Imagine how different our economy, and our country, would be if more workers owned a slice of their companies.  The potential impact on wealth for workers, financial literacy, employee engagement, employee quit rates, and productivity is massive 

Also pls check out Ownership Works for information about and updates on the broader employee ownership movement underway.  The team at OW is doing a lot of amazing work

Janice MacKenzie was minding her own business as our Walmart Care Clinic provider relations lead when Shannon Borkowski asked she and I to take on the task of standing up a call center for Walmart Health.  I had managed a call (dispatch) center in the past, but admittedly neither of us knew what we were doing.

Janice learned quickly, and I worked feverishly to stand up infrastructure, she took on the task of developing processes and procedures.  Janice would go on to become the call center leader.  We affectionately named the call center ""Care Center"", because we believed that for many patients, that first interaction was where there care would begin. 

Janice, along with her partner in crime, Michelle Wise, has been a fantastic leader for the Care Center.  Under her leadership, the Care Center has gone from a standard call center operation taking a few dozen calls a day, to a center that not only was managing 15,000 inbound calls per week (with a 25% appointment conversion rate), but also managed:

- 12,000 outbound calls per week
- Virtual dental treatment coordination
- Centralized patient referrals
- Medicare Advantage outreach
- New employee systems onboarding
- Centralized PO/Invoice Processing
- Soft collections

These leaders motivated their team to do incredible things!

Janice is a curious and dedicated leader.  Her care for her team is unwavering.  I would go into battle with Janice (and Michelle) any day of the week.

My immediate thoughts are with our impacted associates. To a person, these amazing talents were drawn to Walmart Health's mission to solve access, convenience, and affordability challenges for the communities we have been honored to serve. I could not be prouder of them and the care they have consistently provided since our opening. I think about the hundreds of thousands of patients we served and who have come to rely on Walmart as a partner in health and wellbeing. We will continue to support you and care for you as your care is transitioned to new providers. And finally, to my leadership team and the many professionals that supported us, there are not enough words nor the right ones to express my deepest gratitude for your consistent excellence and drive. We have been on quite a journey, and though it didn’t end where I had hoped it would, there is much to celebrate in the accomplishments achieved and the friendships that have been forged. There will be a time in the future to think about and discuss the challenges specific to retail healthcare. Suffice to say, it is a sad day, but I will not allow it to diminish my determination or reduce my optimism in the good that retailers like Walmart can accomplish with its scale and resources.

Through Fintech Takes, I get to know a lot of people who are looking for a new role. 

These folks span the gamut. 

Some are trying to get their first job in financial services or make their first jump to a new company. 

Some have 5-15 years of experience and are looking to climb up to the next rung on the ladder.

And some of them have 15-30 years of experience or more. Obviously, these folks are older (generally 45-70), and their resumes are more likely to include stops at banks or traditional bank technology vendors. 

This last group has, by far, the most difficult time getting jobs at fintech companies. 

And it's not just early-stage startups, where there might be a legitimate mismatch on expectations regarding compensation or work/life balance. It's later-stage and public fintech companies too!

This is baffling to me. Obviously, it's not a stated policy at these companies to not hire anyone over a certain age (that would be illegal). However, the anecdotal evidence (and I have a lot of it at this point) has convinced me that this is a real thing.

I mention this for two reasons:

1.) As the overlap between fintech and banking increases, the value of employees with more financial services experience increases as well. Fintech companies of all sizes should be critically examining their candidate sourcing and evaluation processes in order to ensure they aren't missing out on opportunities to hire these folks.

2.) If you work at a fintech company and are legitimately interested in hiring some of these folks, let me know. I am happy to add your company to the list of places I'll recommend moving forward!",MISC,,,,Michael,Senuta,Truist,Banking,Head of Innovation and Partnerships at Truist,207,44,7,2w,,,,Michael Senuta likes this,Likes,,2024-05-08 20:09,5/8/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,8:09 PM,,,,,,,,,,,258,Engagement,8pm-9pm,May 2024,checked

Employee: ""I'd like to be considered for a 15% raise. My performance over the years has been consistently at the top, I'm managing people and putting in place processes & standards even though I'm not a manager.""

Company: ""We can manage a 2.5% increase.""

Employee: ""I appreciate it but I do have another offer with a 20% raise, I don't want to leave, is there anything you can do to come close to matching.""

Company: ""Unfortunately not. Our hands are tied.""

Employee: ""Thank you, I appreciate the effort, but I'll have to move on.""

This scene plays out all too often, unfortunately.

As a matter of fact, I'm in Spain 💃 at a conference and a brilliant Performance Engineer just walked me through a very similar scenario at his startup (shocker, it happens both at enterprise and startups). I hear about this issue constantly. It's baffling how companies will balk at fair pay for their standout employees but will pay over the odds for external hires when their stars leave.

Does this strategy ever truly pay off? NO! The cost of losing an irreplaceable team member goes far beyond the financial—they take with them invaluable knowledge, experience, and spirit! ⚡

The math is simple: paying well is cheaper than replacing excellence.

Why wait until it's too late to recognize the value of your best people? Pay what they deserve, not just what you think you can get away with. Even if it means you have to fight for an off cycle exception, just do it!

Our industry is still very early in understanding how to secure our developers.  Our first step in the alliance will be focused on education — where we’ll be working with Gigamon, Lacework, Aviatrix, and Opus Security to publish:

 - Best practices for implementing and managing observable DevSecOps processes and compliance
 - Guidance on using technologies and tools conducive to the adoption of observable DevSecOps
 - Requirements, benefits, and approaches to DevSecOps for application security

Beyond training, we expect to share more news about technology integrations between New Relic / FOSSA to tie build-time and runtime vulnerability insights together for developers. 

As Krystle Portocarrero summarizes in our announcement: ""Together we’ll offer a seamless, integrated experience that empowers developers to innovate in the cloud and confidently leverage the full spectrum of open-source software to accelerate their projects while maintaining a strong security posture.""

New Relic is leading the pack on innovating in how observability can distill the signal out of noise coming from cloud security tooling.  I encourage everyone to try New Relic Vulnerability Management and follow the SDA to see what is possible.

Huge thanks to our many friends at New Relic that made this possible — Krystle Portocarrero, Oren Ben-Shaul, Manav Khurana, Ashan Willy, Peter Pezaris.  Excited for what’s next!!

If you were to ask people how long Margaret Downs has been part of the Walmart Health team, they would likely say that she's been with us for years.  That's because in the short 11 months that Margaret has been with us, she has made many years worth of impact.

I am proud to say I was part of the hiring team that brought Margaret to Walmart.  It is unequivocally one of the best hiring decisions I have ever been a  part of .  Margaret is wicked smart.  She is a quick learner.  She is tenacious.  She will does not accept failure as an option.  She is everything that you want in a strategic or tactical leader. 

We hired Margaret to help drive success in our new sites.  That said, as we were in a lull between last year's site launches and this year's, we gave Margaret other work to do.  It did not matter if we asked her to lead a project team, or tackle a complex business case analysis, Margaret rose the challenge.

Margaret once told me that she applied for 41 positions at Walmart before we hired her.  To that, I saw 41 Walmart hiring managers' losses were our gain.  As Margaret looks for what's next, I say to my Walmart colleagues, DO NOT BE THE NEXT LEADER who passes of the opportunity to keep Margaret Downs in the family.  If you're not a Walmart leader, this is talent you should strongly consider adding to your organization.

My immediate thoughts are with our impacted associates. To a person, these amazing talents were drawn to Walmart Health's mission to solve access, convenience, and affordability challenges for the communities we have been honored to serve. I could not be prouder of them and the care they have consistently provided since our opening. I think about the hundreds of thousands of patients we served and who have come to rely on Walmart as a partner in health and wellbeing. We will continue to support you and care for you as your care is transitioned to new providers. And finally, to my leadership team and the many professionals that supported us, there are not enough words nor the right ones to express my deepest gratitude for your consistent excellence and drive. We have been on quite a journey, and though it didn’t end where I had hoped it would, there is much to celebrate in the accomplishments achieved and the friendships that have been forged. There will be a time in the future to think about and discuss the challenges specific to retail healthcare. Suffice to say, it is a sad day, but I will not allow it to diminish my determination or reduce my optimism in the good that retailers like Walmart can accomplish with its scale and resources.

If you were to ask people how long Margaret Downs has been part of the Walmart Health team, they would likely say that she's been with us for years.  That's because in the short 11 months that Margaret has been with us, she has made many years worth of impact.

I am proud to say I was part of the hiring team that brought Margaret to Walmart.  It is unequivocally one of the best hiring decisions I have ever been a  part of .  Margaret is wicked smart.  She is a quick learner.  She is tenacious.  She will does not accept failure as an option.  She is everything that you want in a strategic or tactical leader. 

We hired Margaret to help drive success in our new sites.  That said, as we were in a lull between last year's site launches and this year's, we gave Margaret other work to do.  It did not matter if we asked her to lead a project team, or tackle a complex business case analysis, Margaret rose the challenge.

Margaret once told me that she applied for 41 positions at Walmart before we hired her.  To that, I saw 41 Walmart hiring managers' losses were our gain.  As Margaret looks for what's next, I say to my Walmart colleagues, DO NOT BE THE NEXT LEADER who passes of the opportunity to keep Margaret Downs in the family.  If you're not a Walmart leader, this is talent you should strongly consider adding to your organization.

I don't know what the future hold for me, but the one thing I know for certain is that if I have opportunity to bring Margaret Downs along, I absolutely will.  Good luck being the person that beats me to the punch!!",MISC,,,,Margaret,Downs,Walmart Health and Wellness,Healthcare Providers,Director of Operations & Implementation,133,6,2,2w,,,,Margaret Downs loves this,Reaction,,2024-05-08 15:19,5/8/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,3:19 PM,,,,,,,,,,,141,Engagement,3pm-4pm,May 2024,checked

Eric has had a remarkable journey at Mars since joining in France, in 1984. During his impressive career with the business, Eric led various business functions across all continents (except Antarctica), moving 12 times and living in five countries. Eric leaves a legacy of making Mars a place people want to join, stay and grow. He helped the business expand into what it is today, leading through complex changes, uncertainty and acquisitions. One of his most notable contributions was the role he played in the acquisition of Royal Canin, a business unit he subsequently ran in the Americas. We are incredibly grateful for all that Eric has done to advocate for our Associates and help our business grow, always using the collective strength of the Mars Five Principles. 

I am also very pleased to share that we are appointing Rebecca Snow as Eric’s successor. Rebecca is particularly passionate about fostering a culture of belonging and creating sustainable growth through people development. She brings great perspective and sets high standards for intellectual curiosity and personal accountability. I am excited about welcoming Rebecca to the Mars Leadership Team.

Eric will be with the company through end of year to ensure a best-in-class transition. I will miss working with Eric but I’m lucky to have him as a lifelong friend, and I will certainly cheer to that!

We tackled the critical issue of messaging clean energy projects effectively and engaging stakeholders in the communities we serve.

A key takeaway: local #opposition is increasingly organized, and #misinformation can be a significant hurdle. This underscores the need for strong, targeted communication strategies that build trust and highlight the (shared) value proposition of clean energy.

But beyond communications strategies, there's no replacement for #humanconnection. Active listening, empathy, and understanding (+adaptation) are essential for building genuine support.

I'm thankful to my The AES Corporation colleagues who cheered me on today and inspire me every day. Opportunities like this are a celebration of their hard work on the front lines, empowering communities as we deploy the energy of tomorrow. While I may be on stage, the spotlight truly belongs to my amazing team.

This conversation carries on. I'll be continuing to beat the drum for the value of in-person engagement and socially + environmentally conscious development.

Thanks to my fellow panelists for a lively discussion. Rosanna Maietta Josh Lahey Lori Lodes Emily Domenech

While there have been many failed retail health attempts, I think this one is different. In this case, David Carmouche, MD, is a very talented leader who truly understands healthcare and how to build successful programs. At least, as successful as a program can be given the real problem. Instead of discussing how the balloon could have or should have been squeezed differently, let's talk about the actual underlying problem: unit economics of a quality patient-provider encounter.

1. The foundational problem with providing accessible and affordable healthcare is that the unit economics are unfavorable, even with Walmart's buying power and low price savvy. 

2. This dynamic will only change once there are genuine ways to improve clinical efficiency (productivity + quality), which requires clinically driven technological disruption of our healthcare delivery system. 

3. When that happens, we will have unit economics that enables accessible and affordable healthcare. 

Until then, we are just squeezing different parts of the balloon and wondering why something always breaks.",MISC,,,,David,Carmouche,Walmart Health and Wellness,Healthcare Providers,SVP Healthcare Delivery,115,14,7,2w,,,,"David Carmouche, MD likes this",Likes,,2024-05-08 20:14,5/8/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,8:14 PM,,,,,,,,,,,136,Engagement,8pm-9pm,May 2024,checked

As an Executive Client Partner, I will be accountable for some of the firm’s largest clients, and collaborating with amazing folks in leading growth and transformation programs. 

Many of you know I’m passionate about meaningful and profitable innovation. This role will certainly embrace that passion by integrating Publicis Sapient’s strategy, product, experience, engineering, and data/AI capabilities (known collectively by the cheeky but handy acronym, SPEED). I couldn’t work any other way. 

After exploring many potential options — going industry-side again,  bringing a human-centered growth capability to private equity, launching a startup, or even being stridently independent — Publicis Sapient felt like the right blend of smart folks, a challenger mindset, and an innovative culture where I would thrive. 

Many thanks to the friends and colleagues who’ve lent their perspective as I explored, very notably Sapient colleagues like Abby Godee and J F Grossen (also ex-frogs), Eldridge Doubleday (also ex-Fjord), longtime friend Todd Cherkasky, Ph.D., and Jagdish Ghanshani.

Led by Carlos Beltre, Head of DEI for Global Technology at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Dan Domenech, the Chief Talent Officer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, shared invaluable insights on fostering diversity and nurturing the next generation of Hispanic leaders. His passion for talent development and commitment to inclusivity shone through as he discussed strategies for creating a robust executive pipeline. 

Key takeaways from the chat included the power of networking, and the need for organizations to embrace develop skills in their employees, having mentors and sponsors that are different than themselves, and using your culture as a strength. 

Domenech also challenged leaders to ask themselves the following questions: 

How are you giving back? 
Who are you mentoring? 
Who are you coaching? 
What is the legacy you wish to create? 

Lastly, Carlos shared with the audience a quote from John C. Maxwell, that “everyone communicates, few connect.”  He encouraged the participants to go beyond connecting via LinkedIn and build relationships that will last. 

Overall, with tips like these, and support from companies, the future for Latino professionals is looking bright!

After taking 5 years out to care for my children, and with my eldest starting school, I was ready to return to the workforce. However, when updating my profile, I felt too afraid to add ‘Full Time Parenting’ to explain my career gap, knowing that it would likely be ignored, rejected or even criticised when seeking employment. So I didn’t. I just removed myself from my LinkedIn, feeling insignificant, worthless and lacking in confidence, as a person who is not welcome in the professional world anymore.

I then started hopelessly searching for school-hour or flexible jobs that would work for my family. Having previously been a teacher, with the aim of becoming a psychologist, I looked for assistant psychologist jobs, as a way to find my identity again. It didn’t help. In fact the job I landed made me feel more confused, as the career I was aiming for before children, wouldn’t work with my new priorities. A three-year, full-time doctorate didn’t seem feasible in the hours I had to play with between the school runs. I’d created a small business whilst my eldest was young, so maybe that was my only option now. I just felt stuck. And I still do.

So after a long-time in limbo, trying to figure out my next steps in my career, I decided to return to LinkedIn. This time, as a mother, who feels proud of the new skills I have gained during this time raising my children.

I have also joined as a woman who wants to raise awareness for the other women who are affected by taking time out of their career by having children. For those who may have been forced out of their previous job and now lack confidence in getting a new one. And for those struggling to return to work, or even apply for jobs, because they cannot find the flexibility they need for their family. 

So this time, I am not only proudly adding 'Full Time Parent' to my profile, alongside a new picture with some of my greatest work, but I am also adding my new business venture, the Five Hour Club: a community to help women return to work after children. 

Not only do I want to raise women up, and recognise the hard work that goes into building a family, but I also want to work closely with employers who also value their previous experience and new skills, so that when they are ready to return to work, there are flexible jobs available that suit their family needs.

Together I believe that we can shape the future of flexible working, because let’s face it, working 9-5 doesn’t work for parents. 

If your career has also been affected since having children, I would love to hear your story. Share below, send me a message, or join our community on Instagram  @fivehourclub. 

I have written this post with the support of Female Founders Rise, a community proudly supporting women.

Maite Cáceres the first Latina driver in F1, a 19-year-old Uruguayan, defied all odds to achieve her dreams, a common trait among #trailblazers. Marcelo's insights into Maite's incredible journey provided valuable lessons applicable to both our personal and professional lives. Here are a few key takeaways:

1. Breaking Barriers - Demonstrates the power of breaking gender stereotypes in traditionally male-dominated fields, highlighting the importance of diversity and inclusion.
 
2. Creating Movements by being the First- Emphasizes the impact of individual actions in sparking broader change and inspiring others to follow suit.

3. Balancing Innovation and Intuition - Underscores the balance between using data to continue to innovate while highlighting the importance of authenticity and intuition in decision-making, showcasing the irreplaceable role of genuine human judgment.

4. Being a trailblazer can feel isolating at times - While success is shared with the team, moments of defeat can be solitary. Having a strong support system is crucial for those times when you feel alone.

5. Resilience and Pursuing Dreams - Illustrates the resilience required to pursue dreams despite challenges, emphasizing the message that it's never too late to follow one's passions and achieve success.

6. Legacy and Gratitude - Reflects on the importance of feeling fulfilled and grateful for support received, emphasizing the significance of acknowledging and appreciating the contributions of others.

7. Confidence and Self-Belief - Underscores the importance of self-belief and perseverance in overcoming obstacles and achieving personal growth.

I understand Casey Winters's statement (and have spoken with him about it), and I understand Ed Biden's sentiment. But...

Someone hired those PMs. Someone funded those companies. Someone set expectations for those PMs. A leader benefitted (or didn't from their work). Someone had the job to mentor those PMs, and share business context and the strategy (assuming one even existed). Zero-interest rates impacted their companies, and may have in turn set expectations for their roles. This makes it about the PMs vs. the perverse incentives in companies during zero interest rates.

Also creeping into these descriptions are character judgements on individuals (""Don't feel accountable""). Do we really believe there is some epidemic of people who don't feel accountable vs. environments where accountability is increasingly unsafe, unhealthy, or otherwise?

Flash from the Commander, NAVSUP, and Chief of Supply Corps
9 MAY 2024

I am excited to announce that first tour Supply Corps officers will now have an opportunity to serve as department heads onboard littoral combat ships (LCSs).

As Navy missions have evolved, so too has the LCS. The platform is equipped with long range, precision naval strike missiles that can seek and destroy enemy ships at great distance.  LCSs were originally designed to meet the Navy’s urgent requirement for shallow-draft vessels to operate in the littorals, countering growing asymmetric threats like coastal mines or diesel submarines.  Mission modules give LCSs tremendous flexibility and increasing lethality.

We’re looking to send six ensigns to LCSs over the next year.  The training pipeline will be similar to other existing Independent Duty BQC billets, where candidates will attend Supply Officer Department Head Course (SODHC) immediately following graduation.  We’ll follow up this formal training with immersive stops at the TYCOM and LCS Squadron before reporting for duty.

It’s rare we get an opportunity to expand our footprint at sea, but one that we relish with enthusiasm.

I am pleased to announce our first SC LCS Suppo is ENS Kwame Kusi.  ENS Kusi will report to USS Charleston (LCS 18) out of San Diego and was hand selected out of the most recent BQC class to fill this critically important new DH assignment.

We heard from Maite Cáceres, the 19-year-old Uruguayan trailblazer who is poised to become the first Latina driver in Formula 1. Despite being one of the few sports in the world where men and women can compete together, no woman has raced in F1 – the highest level of motorsport – since the 1970s. 

She has shown that she isn’t just racing cars; she is racing towards inclusivity, shattering long-standing records and preconceptions as the first Uruguayan to compete on the international Formula racing stage and the only female driver from Latin America in the circuit. 

As an engaged audience member made note of Maite’s accomplishments, “if they can see it, they can be.”  Maite’s wins are a win for all women, as she has made history and opened doors for others to follow. 

Maite also signed the gloves and the helmet she used in her race! Both will be auctioned in the fall HITEC gala, with proceeds benefitting the The HITEC Foundation . Don’t you want a chance to own gloves and a helmet from the future 1st Latina Formula 1 champion?

Thank you to my leadership team and Bank of America for the opportunity to engage in a truly special program. My heart is full of gratitude, reflection and inspiration! There were so many impactful moments, some of which included:
- Hearing from and connecting with Nellie Borrero, a fearless Boricua from the Bronx, who built a successful 35-year career in Corporate America based on authenticity and claiming her space. I am so excited to read her new book “Unwavering: Rejecting Bias, Igniting Change, Celebrating Inclusion.”
- Meeting and connecting with Yamila Harris, who made me feel warm and at home, leaning in to my childhood growing up in Miami, sharing her personal stories and how she inspires her team to adopt a growth mindset. I am impressed by her tenacity and accomplishments, and aspire to lead in the way she does. 
- Listening to some amazing speakers and published authors like Marcelo De Santis and David Olivencia who shared their journey and the art of storytelling. There is value to being vulnerable, not only to see how far we’ve come, but share our stories with others to inspire and educate.
- Hearing from and meeting Maite Cáceres, who is poised to become the first Latina driver in Formula 1 motorsports. At the age of 17 she became the only Latina to be accepted into the F1 Academy. She is challenging the status quo, breaking barriers, and carving out her own path. Proud and inspired to learn from her and look forward to following her journey! 
Last and most importantly, it was incredible to be in a room full of 500+ Hispanic/Latino Senior Leaders, everyone with a different background and story, from different countries and islands, all with the same mission to #pushupandpullup and create connections that embrace us all as #familia. HITEC is “one-of-a-kind” and I’m so grateful for all of the new friends I’ve made.

I would like to start off by sharing my favorite episode of the American Dream Podcast with none other than my mother Consuelo. 

This is a very special episode for me because it truly defines the dream of an immigrant family: to provide a home and comfort to those we love the most.

A lot of big surprises in here (even for myself). My mother is worse than me and totally punks me several times in this episode. Other than that I love her to death.

For those who have been following Lindley Center at Washington and Lee University since it was announced a year ago, I’m happy to share a progress report.
 
Just last weekend, we received an incredible boost from Lindley’s classmates in the class of 1999. They generously made the center’s construction their 25th reunion class project, exceeding every benchmark they set for donations. In total, they raised over $1.4 million dollars… an inspiring sum, dedicated to the memory of a truly inspiring person. All of us involved in this project from the Spaht Family Foundation — my parents, brother, and brother-in-law — are humbled by her class’s generosity.
 
W&L holds a special place in the hearts of us Spahts — not just as the alma mater of my late sister, but as the now-home of my eldest daughter. When the Lindley Center is completed in fall of 2025, Eliza will be entering her senior year. She and her classmates will be able to use Lindley as a resource for their own physical and mental wellness — just as so many of her loved ones and patients did in life.

Just wait 'til 2025 (well actually AEP this fall) same story, different names and this time I'm guessing it could be hundreds of thousands that have to find a new plan. HCC v28 is proving as lethal to Medicare Advantage as the Balanced Budget Act was in the late ‘90s. 

I dug into the Medicare enrollment data and was honestly surprised. I couldn’t find any Walmart Flex enrollees in the 2024 data. I started to wonder if my hypothesis of last week that the bigger reason Walmart Health made such an abrupt departure was because of their Medicare Advantage risk. 

Imagine my surprise when I found that there were actually close to 35k enrollees in Walmart Flex MA plan in July of last year. Admittedly I thought it would be a few thousand. 35k is impressive for the first year MA plan in 2 states, even a co-branded Medicare Advantage offering. But it’s a risky proposition - not just because you may not have the acumen to design a profitable product, manage the population well early on but there is also that pesky little thing called risk score that can wreak havoc on that first year of being an MA plan. 

I’m making a whole slew of assumptions here (so forgive me if you know the details and I'm wrong) BUT after modeling some things this morning I've affirmed my stance that the financial risk of these 35k lives dwarfs the FFS revenue mix of business issues that certainly existed and many have highlighted. It also sheds more light on the complexities and nuances of generating meaningful profit as a primary care clinic, especially one you are trying to scale quickly. 

The devil is in the details. Managing lives is HARD. I have so much more to say, this might warrant a detailed write-up. Oh and we will talk about this and more next Friday with our actuarial friend Colby Schaeffer on our first Live edition of The Reverse Mullet Healthcare Podcast - more info to come...

My fellow engineers and I gathered this week, for the IEEE Power & Energy Society bi-annual conference, led by Shay Bahramirad, in our collective quest to build solutions to the biggest problems we face today.

It gives me great hope when I think about the strength of this community of talented, dedicated engineers and energy professionals all over the world. My good friend and recently retired Southern California Edison (SCE) executive, Erik Takayesu, kicked off the event, welcoming the crowd who traveled great distances from more than 70 countries. I had the honor of taking the stage after Erik. I shared how we find ourselves in a time of convergence of both growing challenges and maturing advantages that, taken together, can help us unlock the solutions to the issues we wrestle with every day. 

In addition to our guests from around the world, I was so impressed with our robust team of SCE volunteers who have worked behind the scenes for two years, allowing our company to host this special event.

All I can add is that since I have known her, she has been a daily role model for me on how to be a better law firm lawyer and in-house counselor. She works tirelessly so that her advice feels effortless; she stresses fine details so that she can speak confidently; she is calmest when things are the most chaotic.

For over half a century, this organization has stood as a symbol of unwavering commitment to reshaping healthcare and championing the well-being of communities nationwide.

My connection to NAHSE runs deep. From receiving a book scholarship as a high school senior, which set me on an unforeseen path towards a career in healthcare, to founding a chapter in Connecticut early in my career, to having spent these last few formative years in St. Louis serving as part of one of its founding chapters, NAHSE has been a guiding force every step of the way. 

It fills me with pride to celebrate the legacy of Morris Henderson, who led what is now CareSTL Health, for playing a pivotal role in establishing this esteemed organization. The founders’ vision and dedication laid the groundwork for an association that continues to thrive and make a tangible impact to this day. And now, returning to the N.A.H.S.E. Connecticut chapter I helped establish, I am brimming with excitement and determination to propel NAHSE's mission and vision forward.

One of the most striking attributes of NAHSE is its ability to cultivate a dynamic community that spans all stages of professional development. Whether individuals are just starting out on their educational journey, navigating the complexities of early-career growth, or driving organizational change as seasoned executives, NAHSE offers a supportive network where aspirations are nurtured and connections flourish. The annual spring event serves as a vibrant gathering, uniting professionals from diverse backgrounds with a shared goal of catalyzing positive chang and I’m grateful to have been part of it. 

At the core of NAHSE's mission lies a steadfast commitment to promoting health equity. Through advocacy and action, NAHSE empowers its members to not only excel in their individual roles but also contribute to the broader objective of fostering a more equitable healthcare landscape. These efforts extend far beyond institutional boundaries, touching the lives of countless individuals within communities.

The ongoing dedication of the NAHSE STL chapter to advancing health equity initiatives, such as amplifying the Bias Time Out, exemplifies the enduring spirit of NAHSE. I’m excited to be speaking about the Bias Time Out Tool at our June 4 symposium. Details coming soon!

Year and a half later, our partners at Desert Mission food bank transformed that vision into reality!

Today marks the kickoff of our produce prescription pilot program at HonorHealth led by Anne Costa and her team. The produce comes from local small farms, including many BIPOC farms across Arizona.

Our office was the first location to receive the produce. Patients collected it, and afterward, we gathered in the group space to empower and educate one another with shared wisdom during our food as medicine group medical visit . We even prepared a salad using the fresh ingredients. Some patients took inspiration from this and created beautiful recipes of their own! 

I extend my heartfelt appreciation to Denise Coventry MS, RD, IFNCP our exceptional dietitian, for consistently sharing her wealth of knowledge on nutrition with our food as medicine groups. Her insights enrich our understanding of the crucial relationship between food and health.

This experience encourages us to pause and reflect on the notion of food as medicine, urging us to reimagine and reclaim our health.

She’s served as a role model for me in more ways than one. 

While growing up, my mom experienced tremendous hardship and tragedy, losing both her biological father and then her stepfather. When she was a toddler, her biological father passed away, resulting in her mother (my grandmother) placing her in an orphanage for five years as she was unable to care for three young children. Later when my mom was in middle school, her stepfather passed away of cancer. 

As my grandmother became ill, my mom – a teenager at the time – found herself becoming a caregiver for her younger brothers.

Despite all of these obstacles, my mom managed to become the first in her small high school to attend the top university in Taiwan.

And she managed to then attend an Ivy League graduate school in the United States! 

I want to thank my mom for teaching me life lessons:

➡️ Always be there to support those in your care in both the good and tough times

➡️ #Resilience is built through challenges

➡️ Change is constant

➡️ Be positive and believe in possibilities

These lessons can also be applied to leadership.

I hope that my kids will one day thank me for similar life lessons that they have learned from me as a mom.

Happy Mother’s Day, mom. And to my kids, I am so proud of you and grateful each and every day to be your mom!
 
Being a mom is my most rewarding – and at times, the toughest – role that I’ve ever had. ❤️

Happy Mother’s Day to all of the mothers, stepmothers, grandmothers and mother figures out there. To those of you who have lost a mother, my thoughts are with you during this difficult time.

Our social initiatives have touched the lives of more than 2,000 individuals across 16 municipalities spanning four departments.

Uprooting my family, leaving a company I loved for a new job, new schools, church and neighbors, seemed much too difficult.  Looking back, I will forever be grateful for the peaceful feeling my family and I experienced when we decided to take the leap. 

Last fall I was asked to lead HR for all of Domino’s.  It was my dream job, working with an amazing boss, peers, and team for a company I had come to love.  All was wonderful!  Not long afterwards, I made one of the toughest decisions of my life.  My wife and I decided we needed to move back to Utah, which resulted in departing Domino’s and Saline, Michigan - leaving our friends, and new family. 

To many, this move doesn’t make sense.  How could I walk away from all of this?  In the moment, I had similar thoughts.  However, the same peaceful feeling that confirmed to us that moving to Ann Arbor was right, however scary, told us that moving closer to family, now, was where we were supposed to be.  Our three children have never known what it’s like to live around cousins or their grand parents.  Especially at a time when our parents are aging, family has never been more important.

While the last few months have almost been overwhelming, I express my sincere appreciation to my Domino’s and Michigan family.  Informing my boss and great friend, Russell Weiner, tells you a lot about him.  Putting aside his initial shock, the first thing he did was give me a hug and asked how he could help.  I can’t describe how much that still means to me.

And so we move forward as a family, trusting that we can both be guided and comforted through doing hard things that we know to be right.  I am confident in the future, whatever it holds!",MISC,,,,Joyce,Oh,Moffitt Cancer Center,Healthcare Providers,Chief Information Officer,463,68,0,3w,,,,Joyce Oh likes this,Likes,,2024-05-10 16:48,5/10/2024,Friday,Friday,4:48 PM,,,,,,,,,,,531,Engagement,4pm-5pm,May 2024,checked

→ Our first hospital pilot had just 17% patient adoption

→ Changed our company name because too many people - including my co-founder - couldn’t say it properly

→ Couldn’t convince a VC investor to lead our seed round

→ Churned our 1st US customer because we sold the product without getting clinician buy-in (and by then it was too late)

→ Bounced around in research study and grant project purgatory for many years

→ Signed wrong-fit customers because we were desperate to work with anyone (of course it was more work than we expected and of course they eventually churned)

→ Wasted countless hours on stuff that didn’t matter (e.g. a town hall debate over whether a healthcare company should provide “unhealthy snacks” in the office… yes this actually happened)

And yet… we’re still here.

We are living proof that you can make tons of mistakes in Health Tech and still survive.

Just get a little better each day.

The goal of the Summit is to curate a space where funders and nonprofit partners can truly engage in meaningful discussion on how to build a better community together, for the benefit of our great region. 
 
In this fourth installment of the series, participants focused on capacity-building topics that support and lift the nonprofit sector, such as staffing, retention strategies, and building and sustaining organizational culture. 

The Summit started with a panel discussion followed by breakout sessions that dug deep into their own organization’s strategic plans for the coming year. 
 
Today’s event provided a unique opportunity to learn and gain insight from each other in a more personal way. I hope these discussions foster the growth of philanthropy in San Diego, aligning with the evolving needs of nonprofits. 

We were honored to have been joined by Danny Kim, PhD, Sr. Director of People, Culture, and Diversity at the San Diego Foundation who moderated today’s discussion with Taylor Mauriello (Harrell), Ph.D., Chief People Officer at MAAC, Christiana Tasto, MA, Executive Director for Nonprofit Solutions and Tony Teravainen PMP CSSBB, CEO and Co-Founder of Support The Enlisted Project (STEP). The panelists discussed how philanthropy can play a significant role in the aspirations of the communities that we serve, and the intersectionality of Value/Mission, Capacities, and Public Support. 
 
I would like to send a big kudos to Shaina Gross, Jennifer Cota and Marvin Ordonez for organizing and curating such a magnificent event for our nonprofit partners.

Just like it’s the people who make the party, it’s the connections, followers, and my biggest supporters that make the social. 

Some conversations can’t wait for a conference, panel, keynote, paper, blog, or podcast, or press release. I’m grateful for everyone who is walking along this life of patient advocacy with me. 🙏

Thank you for listening, engaging, sharing, advocating, amplifying, disagreeing, debating, dreaming big, venting, celebrating, and crying with me. ❤️

Thank you for every single personal story you may have shared with me as a result of one of my posts. I cherish all of them deeply. 

In kindergarten, my name was always on the board for talking. To my kindergarten teacher: same me, just a little older, and my voice has only gotten louder and stronger. 

Here’s to many more conversations off the cuff, right here. Walk with me 🏃‍♀️

Our President and CEO Paul Burdiss offered the keynote address at the U.S. Small Business Administration Utah District’s National Small Business Week Awards ceremony.
 
Edith Gallegos and Alma Lopez of Cakes by Edith received the Minority-Owned Business of the Year. Gallegos immigrated to the U.S. in 1995, making and selling cakes out of her home until it became too small to meet the growing demand for her delicious cakes. They were introduced by Zions Bank's Board Chair Scott Anderson.
 
Zions Bank was proud to receive three awards in recognition of our efforts to provide capital to small businesses: Export Lender, 7(a) Women-Owned and Rural Lender for 2024. 
 
In Idaho, Molly Leadbetter of Meriwether Cider was recognized as the Woman-Owned Business of the Year by the SBA Boise District Office. Leadbetter is the Gem State’s only pommelier and has been instrumental in the growth of this award-winning family-owned business.

Congratulations to all the honorees — we wish you much continued success on your entrepreneurial journey!

👀 Physical:

- A lower voice
- Increasing muscle mass 
- Fat redistribution in my face & body 
- (Some) facial hair 
- My feet have grown so much I've gone up two shoe sizes (weird I know) 
- Increased body hair 

🧠 Non-physical: 

- The ability to look in the mirror and love what I see 
- The motivation to take care of my health and wellness 
- The self-confidence and self-belief to start my own business
- Better relationships with my friends and family because I am happier and calmer
- Significantly improved mental health including a reduction in my anxiety
- The ability to address my issues with alcohol and maintain my sobriety for over three years and counting 
- A new interest in investing in my future
- The capacity to care better for others and be involved in activism and non-profit work to support marginalised communities 

The point? It's not always about the things you can see.

I strongly believe our work has never been more relevant. Demand for our work continues to soar because major companies recognize that if they want to grow, they need to be able to retain and attract diverse leaders. Companies that have a diverse workforce and diverse leaders outperform those that do not. The Hispanic community continues to be one of the fastest-growing and most economically influential population segment in the US. HITEC brings it all together — Diverse leaders, skilled in technology – helping companies innovate and grow. 

Last week, more than 500 Hispanic technology professionals and executives gathered in Houston for the largest-ever HITEC event. The HITEC Spring Leadership Summit hosted by Hewlett Packard Enterprise brought together the very best in our community - intent on connecting and inspiring, and committed to accelerating the power and impact of Hispanic technology leaders achieving lasting equity from the classroom to the boardroom.

This special day at Fifth Third Bank not only highlights our commitment to the community and our customers, but it also showcases the collaborative spirit and dedication of our fantastic teams.

Fifth Third Day is more than just a celebration; it's an opportunity for us to give back and address pressing community issues like food insecurity. By partnering with local organizations like the United Way of Greater Cincinnati, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Cincinnati, and The Society of St. Vincent de Paul - Cincinnati, we're able to make a significant impact and help those in need. 

A huge shoutout to our MOB core team of Lasabra Hyden, Melessa Walker, Beth Fillmore, Kimberly Murray, Jamie Chapman, and Delisha Murray. Your dedication and hard work were instrumental in making today a success. I am truly grateful for your collaboration and support.

Thank you to everyone who participated and helped us move forward in our mission to fight food insecurity. Let’s continue to make a difference, together!

We also learned about green hydrogen and NY’s journey toward using it from a panel of savvy and knowledgeable experts: Haiyan Sun, Kassy Hart, & Jennifer Smith; brilliantly moderated by Letitia Midmore.

Thank you to all who attended - it was great to see so many of you! To be surrounded by so many talented and wonderful women in the industry, including those from my own organization means so much. Lisa Primeggia, Natalia Saldarriaga, Juliane Luongo 

And finally, thank you to the Planning Committee (especially Renata Ashapatov, who understood the vision and executed it perfectly!) and to the WICE Board for their guidance, support, and enthusiasm always!

24 ways to know if you have it:

First, what integrity's not:

Doing what's popular instead of what's right
Acting differently in private than in public
Saying one thing and doing another
Letting fear dictate your decisions
Taking credit for others' work
Valuing success over ethics
Hiding your mistakes
Following the crowd
Turning a blind eye
Making excuses
Blaming others
Staying silent

Integrity is:

Transparency
Ethical behavior
Keeping your word
Acting with courage
Treating others fairly
Owning your mistakes
Respecting confidentiality
Showing respect for others
Admitting when you're wrong
Standing up for what you believe
Refusing to compromise your values
Doing what's right, even when it's hard

In a world that values success at any cost,
integrity is the ultimate success.

➟ It's always doing the right thing.
➟ Not because someone is watching.
➟ But because it's the right thing to do.

The day opened up with Sara Naison-Tarajano, global head of Goldman Sachs Apex, who kicked off an impressive line-up of speakers who discussed a range of timely topics, including the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape, opportunities in venture and growth, what it takes to build a multigenerational family office, and more. Here are a few insights from the sessions:
 
• Michael Rubin, chief executive officer of Fanatics, discussed how constant innovation in business is critical to success. His thought process on ensuring that Fanatics had longevity was simple: “If we're just selling what other people are selling, we have no chance of existing long term. We needed to provide a differentiated experience.”

• John Paul DeJoria, co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, and co-founder and chairman emeritus of The Patron Spirits Company, shared his secret to making the most of his time: “Pay attention to the vital few. Ignore the trivial many.” 

• Patrick McCurry, partner at McDermott Will & Emery LLP, Eric Naison-Phillips, managing principal of Winged Keel Group, and Cliff Schlesinger, senior wealth strategist for Goldman Sachs Family Office, shared insights on the key considerations in building and sustaining a multi-generational family office. Naison-Phillips discussed how in later generations, there is a critical realization that the responsibility of strong stewardship is on your shoulders. “You have to ingrain that generation to generation, and it has to be a consistent message,” he said.

I am stunned and consumed with grief, yet grateful for over two decades of friendship and mutual growth. We’ve abruptly been robbed of a true powerhouse—a selfless advocate and changemaker. Today, on my birthday, I am dedicating this space to memorialize her—a brilliant, beautiful soul I have known, trusted, collaborated with, and loved for the last 24 years.

Crystal was a force of nature. As Supervising Attorney and Associate Clinical Law Professor at Mississippi College School of Law, she practiced and taught adoption and youth court law. Here, she created an adoption clinic that transformed many lives and families. She was a revered leader, serving as President of the ACLU of Mississippi and Vice President of the Mississippi Free Press, Immediate Past President of the Board of Directors for the Children’s Advocacy Centers of Mississippi, and a member of the MS Commission on Children’s Justice’s new Website Development Oversight Committee.

Attorney, Professor, Champion, Daughter, Aunt, and my best friend. The thought of going from dozens of daily texts to none is unfathomable. Our friendship began at Bowdoin College, where we discovered a shared spirit of fun, intelligence, and style. Crystal was a discerning connoisseur of words, debate, all things CHANEL, and Hello Kitty. She was a confidante and partner in crime, an irreplaceable friend whose laughter I hope never fades from my memory.

We were supposed to travel to Maine in a few weeks for her Bowdoin Reunion—a trip that will now carry her spirit rather than her presence. The tragic and untimely loss of Crystal, her mother, and her sister in an act of violence has left us numb and heartbroken, reminding us of the fragility of life.

As I grieve for Crystal and her family, I find solace in the immense impact she had on her clients, students, and friends—everyone fortunate enough to know her. Her legacy is not just in the laws she shaped or the students she inspired, but in the love she shared with her family, friends, and little nephew, Dallas.

Though our daily conversations have ceased, her voice will guide me always. Crystal's remarkable life and the devastating circumstances of her passing remind us that we can be forces of change and pillars of support in our communities.

Crystal was a popular influencer on social media and a prominent figure in Jackson's community. Over the past few years, I had urged her to broaden her reach by posting to LinkedIn, believing her unique perspective and insights would be invaluable amidst a sea of noise. Unfortunately, it's now too late for her to do so herself, so I am writing this post for both of us.",MISC,,,,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",205,63,1,2w,"I’m in utter shock.

It's quickly back to reality on Monday morning, and we're already juggling the week's agenda....dinner menus, sports schedules, band concerts and squeezing in your kiddo's long overdue dentist appointment.
 
Moms are amazing, but they are also exhausted. We need to take all of the Mother's Day gratitude and appreciation and channel it into reimagining the way we support moms at work.
 
We're doing it at Brillect by leading with our value of taking care of people. And that starts with connecting people with careers that fit their lives. For one of our consultants that means taking the summers off. For another, it's taking a short break from consulting to focus on a home renovation project. To others, it's having Fridays off or a workday that ends at 3.
 
But it also means giving people the space to do what they need to do. Not eyeing the clock when someone leaves early or raising an eyebrow when someone arrives 10 minutes late to your morning meeting. It's about trusting people to do their work. And leaders, it also means walking the talk to show our employees we practice what we preach when it comes to flexibility and putting people first. 
 
We're all in the thick of this dance called life, and it's not easy to juggle it all. But when we give each other grace, flexibility and the freedom of having a career that meets you where you're at...I think we start to reclaim that joy we have on Mother's Day all year round.

The hand-crafted certificates, letters, and ""record"" pictured below were created by my 5th & 6th grade basketball coach, John Fleury.  I'm not here to talk about my love for hoops - I'm here to share the power of going above and beyond for your team members. 

John was a dude that was probably in his 20s when he was coaching a bunch of pre-teens.  He likely wasn't getting paid for his job as our coach.  There were no requirements for him to create custom recognition for his players. 

But he did just that. 
And he made an impact on me that lives on to this day. 

He demonstrated what it looks like to lift others up, to speak into someone that needs it.  The two years I played for him overlapped directly with a time period that I was struggling to deal with my parents' divorce - that team, and his direct support, are two things that enabled me to get thru that season of life. 

John helped channel my emotions into healthy activities and provided stability and feedback when I needed both most.  And, because of that, I seek to do the same for those that I work with within my team. 

I'm thankful that I re-stumbled across these when I did - it's a great reminder to think about ways to wow those that I appreciate. 

How are you bringing recognition and kindness to life in your personal and professional lives? 

Cheers to using our creativity to lift each other up generously and having folks remember our actions 40 years on. 

p.s.  Experiences like this are the reason I coached my kids when they were young.  And why I created similar certificates for every kid on my teams.  :)  I hope at least one of them felt seen in ways that they hadn't before. What a gift!

Thank you to all my fellow Standard peeps who have built great tech, come together as a team and are bringing the next iteration of Standard forward. And thank you to Angie, Dave and Jordan who have been thoughtful sounding boards, true friends and real warriors.

What’s next? I’m looking forward to time off to reconnect with folks, travel and explore, read (including trying to keep up with what’s going on in AI & robotics) and continue investing in and advising start-ups.

Tailored to my interests and research goals, my master’s program has had a strong emphasis on sustainability and marketing. My research, sponsored by Printpack, compared consumer perceptions to environmental impact realities. With the rise of sustainable initiatives in the packaging industry, my work illuminates the gap between sustainable packaging innovations and consumer sentiments to propose an aligned path forward for future packaging designs. I gained valuable insights into creating life-cycle assessments (LCAs), analyzing material trade-offs, and conducting consumer surveys. It was a privilege to have my research showcased at the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC) Impact conference in April 2024.

I want to extend my sincere appreciation to Andrew Hurley, PhD and my committee, Dr. Billy Bridges, Dr. Duncan Darby, and Dr. Sarah Griffin for supporting me throughout my time as a graduate student. Additionally, thank you to Clemson’s Packaging Science community for its continuous encouragement.

Though it is bittersweet to have completed my time at Clemson, I am eager to apply my knowledge and talents as I join the Newell Brands Packaging Engineering team in Charlotte, NC this summer.

Like many graduates worldwide, I didn't have the opportunity to cross the stage due to restrictions.

However, this year, something special happened. I connected with one of my best friends, Asif Merchant, who was graduating from the same program this year. Despite the challenges life threw at him—torn ACL, Asif and his wife welcoming their beautiful daughter Sophie into the world, and transitioning companies—Asif persevered, excelled, and earned his MBA.

In a random conversation, we joked about walking the stage together, and I decided to reach out to the University about the possibility of walking the stage this year. To my delight, they said yes!

Walking the stage with Asif this past Friday was more than a symbolic gesture; it was a celebration of resilience, friendship, and shared accomplishments.

Congratulations, Asif, on this incredible milestone. Your journey inspires us all to push through obstacles and embrace change. Here's to new beginnings and the exciting adventures that lie ahead. Looking forward to the great things you do.

Since 1998, LATINA Style 50 has been a beacon of excellence, celebrating the achievements of Latinas in the workplace, and this year's event was a testament to the power of diversity and inclusion, bringing together voices from across the country to celebrate progress and inspire change.
 
From thought-provoking panel discussions to dynamic exchanges with corporate leaders, I gained invaluable insights into the journey of Latinas ascending to the pinnacle of success, reinforcing my pride in being a part of Marriott International, a company that doesn't just talk about diversity but actively creates pathways for Latina talent to thrive in leadership roles.
 
Particularly honored to have been able to accept the award for one of the top Hispanic ARGs from the LATINA Style team for our work in 2023, but also share that moment with many leaders from our company and members of our ARG. 
 
Thank you, LATINA Style 50 for creating a platform to celebrate and elevate Hispanic women in the workforce. Together, we're building a brighter, more inclusive future for all.

I am stunned and consumed with grief, yet grateful for over two decades of friendship and mutual growth. We’ve abruptly been robbed of a true powerhouse—a selfless advocate and changemaker. Today, on my birthday, I am dedicating this space to memorialize her—a brilliant, beautiful soul I have known, trusted, collaborated with, and loved for the last 24 years.

Crystal was a force of nature. As Supervising Attorney and Associate Clinical Law Professor at Mississippi College School of Law, she practiced and taught adoption and youth court law. Here, she created an adoption clinic that transformed many lives and families. She was a revered leader, serving as President of the ACLU of Mississippi and Vice President of the Mississippi Free Press, Immediate Past President of the Board of Directors for the Children’s Advocacy Centers of Mississippi, and a member of the MS Commission on Children’s Justice’s new Website Development Oversight Committee.

Attorney, Professor, Champion, Daughter, Aunt, and my best friend. The thought of going from dozens of daily texts to none is unfathomable. Our friendship began at Bowdoin College, where we discovered a shared spirit of fun, intelligence, and style. Crystal was a discerning connoisseur of words, debate, all things CHANEL, and Hello Kitty. She was a confidante and partner in crime, an irreplaceable friend whose laughter I hope never fades from my memory.

We were supposed to travel to Maine in a few weeks for her Bowdoin Reunion—a trip that will now carry her spirit rather than her presence. The tragic and untimely loss of Crystal, her mother, and her sister in an act of violence has left us numb and heartbroken, reminding us of the fragility of life.

As I grieve for Crystal and her family, I find solace in the immense impact she had on her clients, students, and friends—everyone fortunate enough to know her. Her legacy is not just in the laws she shaped or the students she inspired, but in the love she shared with her family, friends, and little nephew, Dallas.

Though our daily conversations have ceased, her voice will guide me always. Crystal's remarkable life and the devastating circumstances of her passing remind us that we can be forces of change and pillars of support in our communities.

Crystal was a popular influencer on social media and a prominent figure in Jackson's community. Over the past few years, I had urged her to broaden her reach by posting to LinkedIn, believing her unique perspective and insights would be invaluable amidst a sea of noise. Unfortunately, it's now too late for her to do so herself, so I am writing this post for both of us.",MISC,,,,Fariha,Greenwood,Houlihan Lokey,Banking,"Head of Digital, Corporate Finance",205,63,1,2w,,,,Fariha Greenwood supports this,Reaction,,2024-05-14 19:22,5/14/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,7:22 PM,,,,,,,,,,,269,Engagement,7pm-8pm,May 2024,checked

Mom https://lnkd.in/g5UXBrkb and I are so incredibly proud of you Edward Kurowski

A bit of wisdom I imparted to him at his graduation party this weekend...
""Be authentic and grateful, do your best, and most importantly, always do the right thing.  Make a positive difference in this world.  Show everyone that kindness still matters, and that love does triumph over hatred.  Listen more that you talk and give everyone respect and your full attention.  Don't take yourself too seriously, and remember to laugh at yourself when deserved."" 

I threw in, ""Even though you're leaving the nest, know that we will always be there to support you.

Some potential implications:

1. Non-US consumers worldwide are a large holder of US Treasurys (or stated differently, the US Govt is increasingly borrowing directly from non-US consumer s)
2. Defi makes it easier for a non-US citizen to buy stables than for a US citizen to buy USTs

3. Our model for financial contagion in a crisis is already outdated; instability in money markets and stables probably will interact with each other in unpredictable ways 

4. The decoupling of US-China probably won't play out as linearly as we think it will

From a youth service posting in Lagos, Nigeria to the C - suite of one of the most important financial institutions in the world, I am thankful for the journey and that I get to decide that it is time to say goodbye and pursue other passions. My career has not been a linear path, but it has exceeded my biggest dreams. 
I’ve had amazing experiences, grown as a leader and forged so many close friendships over the years, and I owe a big thank you to the many sponsors, and mentors who supported and advocated for me along the way. They told me what I now tell so many others – step out of your comfort zone. 

Purpose has fueled my career  and it has been a privilege to help advance economic mobility in communities around the world and also make our industry more representative of the clients we serve. 

I am very fortunate to close out my banking career at Citi working for Jane Fraser, a truly inspirational leader, and will always be a proud Citi alum! In the last few years, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to work with colleagues around the world who delivered with excellence for the firm and our clients as we sought to divest our international consumer businesses and simplify the firm in a very significant and meaningful way. 

As to what’s next? Some downtime first. I plan to travel with my husband and biggest supporter, Wale Cole to spend quality time with friends and family before beginning my next adventure in the nonprofit sector focusing on women and healthcare and giving back to the communities that have given so much to me.

From a youth service posting in Lagos, Nigeria to the C - suite of one of the most important financial institutions in the world, I am thankful for the journey and that I get to decide that it is time to say goodbye and pursue other passions. My career has not been a linear path, but it has exceeded my biggest dreams. 
I’ve had amazing experiences, grown as a leader and forged so many close friendships over the years, and I owe a big thank you to the many sponsors, and mentors who supported and advocated for me along the way. They told me what I now tell so many others – step out of your comfort zone. 

Purpose has fueled my career  and it has been a privilege to help advance economic mobility in communities around the world and also make our industry more representative of the clients we serve. 

I am very fortunate to close out my banking career at Citi working for Jane Fraser, a truly inspirational leader, and will always be a proud Citi alum! In the last few years, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to work with colleagues around the world who delivered with excellence for the firm and our clients as we sought to divest our international consumer businesses and simplify the firm in a very significant and meaningful way. 

As to what’s next? Some downtime first. I plan to travel with my husband and biggest supporter, Wale Cole to spend quality time with friends and family before beginning my next adventure in the nonprofit sector focusing on women and healthcare and giving back to the communities that have given so much to me.

Brazil's FinTech giant Nubank just posted another massive quarter. The growth & numbers NU is showing are out of this world and make it one of the best-run tech companies in the world 😳

Key facts and figures from Nubank's 1Q 2024 earnings:

👥 100 million customers globally (+26% Year-over-Year)
🌍 It's now the largest digital banking platform outside of Asia
🇧🇷 54% of the adult population of Brazil now uses Nubank
🇧🇷 It's now the 4th largest financial institution in Latin America
💰 $24.3 billion worth of deposits (+53% YoY)
💸 $2.7 billion in revenues (+64% YoY)
🤑 $378 million in profit (+160% YoY)

What's also wild is that their average customer is now using more than 4 products 😳

But here comes the crazy part.

NU's customer acquisition costs is something we have not seen before.

Due to customer-friendly, low-cost products, Nubank has a high NPS of around 90. Even a popular brand like Apple only has an NPS of 72, and banks are often in negative territory.

That's why Nubank, to date, still acquires ~80% of its new customers cost-effectively through recommendations and word-of-mouth 😮‍💨

On top of that, despite serving more than 100 million customers, its monthly average cost per active customer remains below $1 🤯

This coupled with a stunning efficiency ratio of ~32% makes Nubank not only one of the best digital banks globally.

It's probably the best-run tech company on the planet right now.

But he DOESN’T have a mobile phone, drives a beat-up Hyundai, and was forced to build a house by his wife.

His company’s stock price also beat the market by 58,500%.

These are a few cool things I just learnt about R Thyagarajan - founder of Shriram Finance (a microfinance bank). 👇

🛡️ 1/ 𝗟𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝗼𝗿 > 𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗵.

Shriram ONLY lends to the poor.

98% of their loans are repaid on time.

Another 1% are paid late.

And only 1% of loans end up defaulted.

Big traditional banks are jealous of repayment rates that high.

Media brainwashes us all to believe that the poor are not credit-worthy.

The facts?

Shriram actually made $200mn in pure profit this year.

Those at the bottom of the pyramid will always find a way to pay you back.

But a rich man?

He’ll just file bankruptcy and move on. (ahem ahem)

📈 2/ 𝗨𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝗡𝗟𝗬 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄.

India’s economic engine is the most impressive thing our world has seen.

But it is uneven as hell.

The top 1% own 40% of the wealth.

Most new wealth creation flows directly to the top.

The ONLY (and I mean ONLY) way to build a sustainable society which doesn’t turn into a scary utopia of upper and lower classes is to push the lowest rungs of the ladder up further.

Bottom-up.

🔗 3/ 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺.

Poor people are given exorbitant rates on their loans.

- Truck drivers have to cough up 80% interest
- Grocers and kirana owners have pay 50% interest
- Education loans go for 35-40% interest

Most poor people just accept this, because there was no other alternative.

Shriram saw the opportunity here and gave them below-market rates.

The result?

Tons of trust built and billions in profit.

💥 𝗕𝗼𝗻𝘂𝘀/ 𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝟭𝗫 = 𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝟭𝟬𝗫.

Thyagarajan gave away $750 million of shares to his employees.

Just like that.

But he also pays mid-level employees 30% BELOW market, and senior executives almost 50% BELOW.

Despite him underpaying employees, most of them reject higher-paying job offers from other banks.

The work is simply that good.

He could have a mansion, but he lives in a 1500 sqft house that his wife forced him to build.

He could drive a different color Rolls Royce for each week of the day, but he goes to work in a Hyundai i10.

He could deck an iPhone 14 in diamonds, but he has no phone and enjoys reading newspapers + birdwatching.

A few weeks ago I turned 40 and was fortunate enough to celebrate with friends and family. Turning 40 made me reflect on a bunch of things (hello, mid-life crisis?) including my career.

If I think back 15 years ago, I remember sitting in class at the London School of Economics after a long day of work writing down my future career path. It looked a little something like: 2 years investment banking at XXX firm, MBA at XXX elite institution, 2 years consulting at XXX firm, corporate development / strategy role at XXX fortune 100 company and so on. 

Fast forward, I literally accomplished none of my plans and in fact, I failed at mostly all of them. I bombed an interview with Citibank, I was too scared to apply to MBAs because I am awful at standardized testing, I made it to the final round with McKinsey - did not get the job, I applied for countless strategy roles - did not even get any interviews.

But ironically, I would not change anything. What both college and my career taught me is there is no substitute for grit, work ethic and perseverance. Yes, I've probably had 4-5 different career paths since I graduated college but as I tell each founder I meet, it is unlikely you will meet someone else that has started their own business, worked for a growth stage company, worked for a company of 2,500 people and worked for a company of 30,000 people (btw, none of it planned). This experience enables me on one hand, to sit aside founders, rolling-up my sleeves and working just as hard as them while on the other hand, strategizing with founders on how to scale a large global business.

As I think about the next 15 years of my career, for me, it is not about roles, companies or responsibilities anymore. It is about continuing to fulfill my personal and professional mission I set with my former executive coach a few years back which is: how do I help people and give back. If I can consistently do those two things, I know everything else in my career will be fulfilling.

These past 8 years have been a real journey for my product career and for me personally. 
- I’ve had the privilege of managing a number of really excellent Product Managers (shouts to Anukrati Pachauri, Rahul Mangalore, Michele Lemze, Tanay Ved, Casey Ritt, Amruta Somalwar, Jessie Moog and Kyle Campbell).
- I’ve gotten into the field to speak directly with many of our incredible Small Business owners in order to build a best-in-class lending experience for them (never forget “Gaia” Nicole Gengaro and Adam Brodowski). 
- And I steered through the ups and downs of the economy (including those strangely heady times in the beginning of the pandemic navigating the PPP waters Bernice Lim and Aaron Eddy) to play a role in providing more than $11B in financing to small businesses across the country.

I've learned so much from great leaders in the space, but most especially Noah Breslow, Jim Granat, and Cory Kampfer. My approach to product has evolved immeasurably learning from, and working alongside Parilee Edison Wang, Gagan Kanjlia, Scott Totman, Tracey Varnell, Sarah Litt, and Mohan Chitrapu. 

Personally, these past 8 years have also seen the birth of our two sons, the loss of a parent and beloved pet, and a move to the City of Brotherly Love. It's been a transformative time to say the least.

As I start to look for my next opportunity - I'm excited to reconnect and see what amazing things everyone has been up to. I would be thrilled to leverage my experience in the Fintech space, but I'm open to any opportunities trying to solve especially knotty product problems or design for underserved customers. I'm particularly interested in getting back to working with people in person again (after 4 years remote!), so if you know of anything happening in the Greater Philly area, I'd love to learn more.

For those who have been following Lindley Center at Washington and Lee University since it was announced a year ago, I’m happy to share a progress report.
 
Just last weekend, we received an incredible boost from Lindley’s classmates in the class of 1999. They generously made the center’s construction their 25th reunion class project, exceeding every benchmark they set for donations. In total, they raised over $1.4 million dollars… an inspiring sum, dedicated to the memory of a truly inspiring person. All of us involved in this project from the Spaht Family Foundation — my parents, brother, and brother-in-law — are humbled by her class’s generosity.
 
W&L holds a special place in the hearts of us Spahts — not just as the alma mater of my late sister, but as the now-home of my eldest daughter. When the Lindley Center is completed in fall of 2025, Eliza will be entering her senior year. She and her classmates will be able to use Lindley as a resource for their own physical and mental wellness — just as so many of her loved ones and patients did in life.

and all while clogging up the internet with dubious content , fake news and fake traffic.

Sandra (or Sandi as everyone knew her) worked at PNC her entire career - 44 years - where she retired as a Vice President of Treasury Management. She had an infectious personality and lived life to the fullest. An avid storyteller, she loved people and was always open for a chat or adventure. In college, she found an artistic outlet in designing and making jewelry. She continued this passion for the rest of her life creating beautiful works of art and developing deep friendships. The relationships she made along the way were very special to her.

Sandi is survived by her husband of 45 years, Ronald and their three children - Nia (Adam) Green, Courtney (John) Schwartz, and Ryan (Brittany Lala) Ashby. She adored her three grandchildren - Parker, Kinsley, and Grayson.

Friends and family are welcome to attend her visitation from 10am to 12pm Friday, May 17, 2024, at St. Luke Greek Orthodox Church, 35 N. Malin Road, Broomall, PA 19008. Her funeral service will take place at 12 noon in the church. Her interment will be private.

In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a donation to the Four Diamonds Fund. She was an enthusiastic supporter of the organization, which helps families battling childhood cancer.

Please keep her husband, their children, grandchildren, and family in your thoughts and prayers.",MISC,,,,Michael,Senuta,Truist,Banking,Head of Innovation and Partnerships at Truist,54,22,2,1w,,,,Michael Senuta supports this,Reaction,,2024-05-16 14:43,5/16/2024,Thursday,Thursday,2:43 PM,,,,,,,,,,,78,Engagement,2pm-3pm,May 2024,checked

That is also what we have focused on from the start.

Our ambition once was: Offer independent, smaller brewers the same opportunities that large breweries have created for themselves.

And we succeeded, we provide (filled) cans with the most beautiful sleeves or printing for many beautiful breweries.

But... we have now come a long way beyond this ambition. We now also serve a different market by producing cans for drinks other than beer. Like this Ice Tea from Oxfam Novib

Want to know more about canned drinks? We get that. Contact Arjen or Jan: arjen@canxlab.com / jan@canxlab.com

Met CanxLab staan we er bekend om dat we samenwerken met veel bierbrouwerijen. Dat is ook waar we vanaf het begin de focus op hebben gehad. 

Onze ambitie was namelijk ooit: Onafhankelijke, kleinere brouwers dezelfde mogelijkheden bieden als die grote brouwerijen voor zichzelf hebben gecreëerd.

En dat is gelukt, we verzorgen voor veel mooie brouwerijen voor (afgevulde) blikjes met de mooiste sleeves of bedrukking. 

Maar... inmiddels zijn we alweer een stuk verder dan deze ambitie. We bedienen nu namelijk ook een andere markt door blikjes te produceren voor andere drankjes dan bier. Zoals deze Ice Tea van Oxfam Novib

Meer weten over drankjes in blik? Dat snappen we. Neem contact op met Arjen of Jan: arjen@canxlab.com / jan@canxlab.com

Those words made me flash back immediately to internal medicine residency, when that was one of my attending’s favourite catchphrase. As a senior resident, it taught me accountability and responsibility, and the importance of thinking two steps ahead. In the hospital, it is easier for the team to rally around “right” thing to do - which is to get the patient feeling better and discharged.

In the informatics world (and upper levels of administration in general), we sometimes lose sight of the patient as the point of singular focus. It’s the budget, or team resources, or personal reputation, or political capital, or many other competing priorities.

During our Earnings call, I announced some important updates to Cisco’s Executive Leadership Team that will help us take the next step in that mission.
 
First I am pleased to share that Gary Steele, the former CEO of Splunk who joined Cisco as part of the acquisition, will be stepping into the newly created role of President, Go-to-Market.
 
Gary and his team will evolve our Go-to-Market motions to execute against our strategy, align with customer needs, and drive a culture of intense competition, agility, and continuous improvement. I look forward to partnering more deeply with Gary in this new role.
 
As part of these changes, Jeff Sharritts, our current EVP and Chief Customer and Partner Officer, will be leaving Cisco after 24 years.

In 2023, AES Indiana marked the completion of its fourth year of the Power of Change program, designed to assist those facing challenges in paying their winter heating bills. Through partnerships with organizations like the Dollar Energy Fund, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, contributors can make tax-deductible donations to support neighbors in keeping their homes warm and well-lit.

Continuously striving to bolster system resilience, AES Indiana undertook significant initiatives in 2023. This included the rebuilding of 208 miles of 15kV circuits and the installation of over 40 miles of static wire. Furthermore, upgrading four 16kV circuits to 15kV capacity has significantly reinforced the grid's robustness, thereby supporting the evolving needs of the community.

A standing ovation is well-deserved by the exceptional team at AES Indiana, who have earned a Great Place To Work US (GPTW) certification in the US for the second consecutive year.

🧾 The 2023 Community Impact Report by AES Indiana highlights these remarkable efforts. As we continue to accelerate the future of energy forward, our commitment to serving alongside our customers remains steadfast.

Saragusa most recently served in a rotational development position as a line superintendent supporting our Power Delivery Louisiana team in the New Orleans area. 

“Lisa’s outstanding tenure and cross functional experience within finance and operations surely makes her a great asset to any team,” said Shelton Hudson, director of reliability in metro New Orleans. “These rotational opportunities challenge employees to learn a different side of the business. On the other hand, they bring a unique level of expertise and perspectives from their previous roles that will further push our departments along the path to premier.” 

Saragusa has more than 26 years of experience with Entergy, serving in various management roles as well as in a regulatory role where she led filings for multiple jurisdictions. She also spent three years in corporate planning before transitioning to power delivery in 2021, taking roles in work management and later as a line superintendent. 

“It’s amazing to see our employees focusing on enhancing their development to achieve career aspirations,” said Steven Benyard, vice president of reliability in Louisiana. “We continue to promote a collaborative work culture to motivate and build ambitious enterprise leaders like Lisa through development programs, leadership coaching and cohort experiences. Personal career development is not only beneficial to your own growth, but also contributes to the success of the company.”

Recognizing how individuals suffering from addiction have long battled shame, stigma and isolation, Corewell Health has opened eight nurse-led addiction clinics with same-day walk-in services for adolescent and adult populations. In partnership with the State of Michigan and other established agencies, clinic staff provide education, training, and easy access to care.
The Corewell Health supply chain has been instrumental in supporting the clinics, leveraging GHX Lumere and collaborating with the health system’s value analysis team to procure the necessary specialty medications needed to address high risk substance use. They have worked with the State of Michigan to maintain a steady supply of Narcan into communities served by the clinics and now stock and supply over 50 Narcan distribution boxes across the state.
The number of individuals treated by the clinics has steadily grown year-over-year; already nearing 1,000 patients in the first two months of 2024. Through this program and its partners, one community reported over 150 overdose reversals in 2023. In 2024, Corewell Health is opening two additional clinics and launching a telehealth program to meet individuals suffering from addiction in their homes, communities, and comfort spaces.
Corewell Health Dependent Drug Stewardship Program Operations Manager Cecily Heaton is recognized as a key contributor for this award.",MISC,,,,Joyce,Oh,Moffitt Cancer Center,Healthcare Providers,Chief Information Officer,7,0,0,1w,,,https://www.ghx.com/awards/ghxcellence/,Joyce Oh likes this,Likes,,2024-05-16 21:50,5/16/2024,Thursday,Thursday,9:50 PM,,,,,,,,,,,7,Engagement,9pm-10pm,May 2024,checked

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution held its 19th Nursing Excellence Awards where three Wellstar nurses were honored. 500 nurses from all of Metro Atlanta gathered to celebrate each other. 
 
On Wednesday, May 8, almost 200 Wellstar DAISY Award honorees celebrated their accomplishments at a luncheon. It was an honor to have Dr. Deb Zimmerman, CEO of The DAISY Foundation and President of the American Organization of Nursing Leadership in attendance along with Wellstar’s CEO, Candice Saunders. The room was filled with excitement as nurses came together to celebrate one another. We heard nomination stories, which allowed all of us to reflect, laugh, and cry. It truly was a amazing event. 
 
Nurses Week is a special time when we can all celebrate nurses, and in turn, nurses can reflect on how they make a difference in the lives of the patients, families, and communities they serve. By fostering a culture of care, our nurses are the heart and soul of our health system.

As I take a moment to reflect on my own nursing career of over 40 years, I am grateful for every experience, patient, and colleague I have met as this has led me to Wellstar. Every day, I am amazed and inspired by the work that the 8,000+ nurses at Wellstar and Wellstar MCG.  You are remarkable. It was such an honor to round this week and meet so many of you. My heart is filled with pride!

You, truly are difference makers!

Located on the St. Jude campus, the GMP facility produces biopharmaceutical products such as recombinant proteins, viral vaccines, viral-based gene therapy vectors and monoclonal antibodies. 

“The GMP facility here at St Jude is a very unique asset that allows projects to be accelerated, timelines shortened and the outcomes to patients improved,” said Frank Fazio, president of the Children’s GMP. 

Indeed, the GMP manufactured a landmark therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (Bubble Boy Disease), a rare and life-threatening disorder.

The meeting is attended by hundreds of employees including our entire executive leadership team and members of our Board and is broadcast virtually to thousands of global employees. 

Not only did I have the pleasure of attending the event this year, I also had the  honor of joining a panel titled ""One Synchrony, Many Voices"" where I and three of my colleagues talked about how our identities shape our experiences walking through the world.

My daughter (7) wrote in blue and my son (10) wrote in red, which helped me compare and contrast themes. 

Woven throughout my son’s comments was admiration for my professional successes and talents, from explicitly mentioning how gifted I am with crafting emails to an inside joke about a “saga” I was struggling with for a bit that produced lots of dinner conversation. 

I knew from my first maternity leave that — for me — I would be the best mother I could be if I was working and remaining engaged outside of the house.  With my newborns, I treated each challenge as a mini consulting project with research and tinkering.  For everyone’s sake, I needed a variety of outlets for problem solving and creativity. 

Yet more often than not I feel guilty.  I have my laptop out at swim practice or gymnastics, less attentive than (some) other parents and bartering around the minimal number of videos I will take to appease my children and conscience. 

If someone had told me a decade ago my son would admire my dedication to my employer, I wouldn’t have believed it.  I may not have believed it a week ago. 

This book was such a beautiful narrative through two lenses, my daughter valuing me for my heart and my son for my mind.  It felt like a tipping point with my eldest where he appreciated how much he benefits from my professional experience.  I can masterfully craft a text to a peer’s parent or teacher on a tricky subject as a seasoned communicator, and I can mentor on small issues having mastered basic persuasive techniques…at least to tackle the biggest challenges of a 4th grader. 

Bravo to all the working mamas out there this Mother’s Day season.  Your children see and admire you more than you know. 

And I implore you to help your friends and coworkers be reminded of their talents in a tough season for working mothers. 

I also appreciate Optum for continuing to afford me the flexibility to juggle the demands of being a dynamo manager and mother.

This has been my greatest achievement. Not because of how prestigious the degree is, but how much I had to overcome to get here. I struggled mentally so much the past three years and law school contributed to it hectically. But through all the trials and tribulations I learned to love myself again. I learned to battle my mental struggles and fight for happiness. This J.D. is symbolism for the level of perseverance I developed through my mental journey. I know the job is not done but we must celebrate milestones.

🎓✨ As graduation season unfolds, it’s a poignant time to reflect on the journeys we embark on, both personally and professionally. This photo of me with my father at my high school graduation is a cherished reminder of those who have been pillars of support and wisdom in my life. 

Inspired by the work of Lucia Knell and Gabriel Reilich of Upworthy by a project to find the best of humanity (which will be released as a book later this year), I am looking so forward to a conversation with Mindy Nguyen , Robin Lickliter along with with other brand leaders 
at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.  Hosted by Sparks 
we will explore the theme of generosity from both a personal and brand perspective. It's a theme that resonates deeply, as we contemplate the impact we aspire to make in the world and the role of media and partnerships in that equation.

As we collectively think about the opportunity to work together within the industry, it’s crucial to remember and appreciate the good people who make our journeys meaningful.

A list of just a few who have made my advertising journey meaningful.🥰

I have had the privilege to work with some amazing teams over my career and had a multitude of great “work families”. As I became a manager, I had the opportunity to see a number of young people enter the profession and was able to mentor them and watch them excel in their careers. Many of them became good friends and I lovingly called them my “work kids” as they were part of my family. As I retire I know that I’ve left the profession with so many smart and capable people that I’ve had the  privilege to work with.  Those relationships I will take with me wherever I go and those “work families” give me a good reason to travel to visit them.

A week back we took our kids to the USA for the very first time. While eating our own dog food, I could see first hand how the above statement is the right vision: 
1) Personal Passions: history, food, aviation, biking, sports. We found activities and guides to match the wide variety of interests between us. 
2) Tech Innovation: from last minute bookings to a self-guided tour with the RayBan Meta Smart Glasses. 
3) Human Connection: at the dr. Martin Luther King memorial our guide told personal stories how his mother lived through the Civil Rights Movement.

🎓✨ As graduation season unfolds, it’s a poignant time to reflect on the journeys we embark on, both personally and professionally. This photo of me with my father at my high school graduation is a cherished reminder of those who have been pillars of support and wisdom in my life. 

Inspired by the work of Lucia Knell and Gabriel Reilich of Upworthy by a project to find the best of humanity (which will be released as a book later this year), I am looking so forward to a conversation with Mindy Nguyen , Robin Lickliter along with with other brand leaders 
at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.  Hosted by Sparks 
we will explore the theme of generosity from both a personal and brand perspective. It's a theme that resonates deeply, as we contemplate the impact we aspire to make in the world and the role of media and partnerships in that equation.

As we collectively think about the opportunity to work together within the industry, it’s crucial to remember and appreciate the good people who make our journeys meaningful.

A list of just a few who have made my advertising journey meaningful.🥰

He recalled a lesson he learned working as a manager at the Department of Economic Development in Dubai. While at work, he chose to help an elderly man who appeared to be in need of assistance with some paperwork.

As it turns out, this gentleman was a secret shopper for the Crown Prince of Dubai at the time, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who later appointed him as the deputy director general of that organization.

I am taking on this challenge to raise money for The Firefly Project, a child poverty initiative from Quintessentially Foundation. I will be cycling 350km, climbing over 7,500m (that is the height of 25 Eiffel Towers, 16 Empire State Buildings, or 9 Burj Khalifa's!!) across one of the highest mountain passes in Switzerland.  And I'm doing this with two other team members from Sabre - Richard Addey and Brett Thorstad.

The Firefly Project focuses on supporting children and young people living in poverty. Over 700,000 children in London live in poverty - the highest child poverty rate in England, and in 2024 this is only getting worse. They face daily challenges that prevent them from reaching their potential.  The Firefly Project finds and funds impactful frontline charities and helps ‘turbo charge’ them through funding and tailored support, allowing disadvantaged children to access their life-changing services. 

I'd be so appreciative of any support you'd like to provide.  See the link below for more details and to donate.

The horse that won is named SEIZE THE GREY, a high priced purchase as a yearling for $300,000 (although many horses go upwards of 7 figure price tags) and he was the 15TH Triple Crown race winner for his 88 1/2 year old trainer D. Wayne Lukas, and it came 44 years after his first Triple Crown race winner - Codex in 1980. D. Wayne still runs an incredible operation, and from his base in Kentucky he is up everyday at 3:30am to be the first to the barn and gets up on horseback daily to watch his string of horses train. 

When they interviewed him after the race about the long line of colleague trainers waiting to congratulate him, he said; “I think they’re trying to get rid of me, they probably want me to retire. I don’t think that will happen there’s still a purpose for me”. Side note; Lukas has been a boss and mentor to countless other horse trainers over the years, some of them have also achieved stardom as triple crown winning trainers.

Simply stated the message here is if you enjoy what you’re doing and still have a passion for hard work which breeds success, then lead by example. Mentor and support others, share your experiences, your unbridled enthusiasm, your secrets, and your legacy can, and will, live on through others. Age is only a number, father time will someday catch up with D. Wayne, but hearing about the many who waiting in line to congratulate him speaks volumes about how much he’ll live on in his industry…",MISC,,,,Michael,Senuta,Truist,Banking,Head of Innovation and Partnerships at Truist,16,3,0,1w,,,,Michael Senuta likes this,Likes,,2024-05-19 21:36,5/19/2024,Sunday,Sunday,9:36 PM,,,,,,,,,,,19,Engagement,9pm-10pm,May 2024,checked

In addressing the four groups of The Wharton School graduates during this weekend, I shared why I believe their unconventional experience has uniquely prepared them for what’s certain to come in the future stages of their life: change. (In the case of our undergrads, this point is particularly resonant with me given that I began my deanship in 2020 under similar circumstances to theirs – remote, online, and unsure of what the future held amid pandemic restrictions.)

After many years of studying leadership, I can say with confidence that this won’t be the last time they face unfamiliar obstacles or difficult situations in which there is no playbook or precedent for how to respond.

In my remarks, I encouraged them to view the education they’ve gained, and the resiliency they’ve developed, as invaluable, necessary foundations capable of leading them through both professional and personal unknowns. I also pushed them to lean on the leadership skills they honed as students as they forge their path forward.

Ontario homeowner Blair Payne described an instance where a tree collapsed on a power line due to a lightning strike, causing a hazardous flash back that traveled up to the side of the house. 

Upon speaking to the fire chief, Payne says that by the time the volunteer firefighters showed up, he would have lost the entire building if he didn’t have noncombustible Hardie® siding to protect the home.

Unlike other building materials – engineered wood, cedar, or vinyl – Hardie® fiber cement products will not ignite when exposed to direct flame*. Watch our latest fire demonstration to see this in action! 🔥🚫

Mazure and a powerful group of women's health investors (and for me personally, many friends). I'm honored to serve as a co-chair alongside super-women Jessica J. Federer and Christina Jenkins, MD and moderate a panel with powerhouses Cathy Friedman (GV (Google Ventures)), Ashlie Tyler (Bank of America) and Konstantina Katcheves. 

Huge thanks to the incredible NYSE team (Johanna (Rodriguez) Grossman, PhD, Samantha Nelson) for convening so much capital-deploying power into a room. And to the sponsors making this all possible - McKinsey & Company (Lucy Perez), Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP (Randi Seigel), Leerink Partners (Sasha Kelemen), The Bowdoin Group (Katelyn Marini), McDermott Will & Emery (Caroline Reignley).
 
My favorite quotes and highlights:
💡Hearing from Lynn Martin, the 2nd female President at the NYSE out of 68 (!!)
💡 Dr. Jill Biden: ""We will build a healthcare system where women aren't an afterthought, but a first thought""
💡Chelsea Clinton: ""It’s important to measure progress. But I don’t think we’ve reached success until we’ve reached parity” and ""We can’t sit here in 2024 and not talk about abortion""
💡Anna Mason: ""What is the best possible question we should be asking"" 
💡Cathy Friedman: ""We need killer companies in women's health""
💡Marsha Henderson: ""Now is the time. The answers could be in this room. What actions will you take, in what time frame?""
 
Cheers to the women's health zeitgeist!

Growing up, I always wanted to take piano lessons. We didn’t have very much money, and we also didn’t have a piano. Some family friends sold us a piano very inexpensively, and I started taking lessons for $7 a week.

I was 11 when my dad lost his job, I wasn’t able to continue lessons. So with 2 years under my belt, I just sort of kept self-studying. I am *no* expert, but I enjoy music immensely.

Fast forward decades, I always made piano lessons for my kids a priority. Even when they complain, I insist.

There is an annual recital, and I get to celebrate the success of watching them learn and memorize music that I couldn’t have imagined they could play.

This year, I was at a lesson with my youngest, and the teacher suggested I do the duet with my daughter. I was thrilled! She’s 9! How hard could that be?

Well… the accompanist part is much more challenging than the child’s part. 😂

I had to practice and learn my song for the recital. We performed this weekend without error, and I was so happy to share that experience with my family! 

Here is what I learned:
1). No matter how old you are, it is nice to show off for your parents. My parents were 77 and in the audience. 💖
2). Committing to a deadline, even if you’re unsure is outstanding motivation. 
3). Leading by example is a better teacher than anything else. My daughter heard everytime I practiced. I never ask her to practice more than I expect from myself…
4). Working with others enhances your craft. I learned my part. My daughter learned her part. And then we had to learn it together. 

What a wonderful journey.

At Conectado, we are about inspiring the next generation of innovators and leaders, empowering them to pursue their dreams and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology and make generational change in the families and community.

Today, we are proud to celebrate our ongoing sponsorship and mentorship of Hollister High School’s Robotics and Engineering Program which just completed its 7th year and competitive season that included four major regionals. Conectado’s very own Michael Martinez is the founding mentor of the program embodying our dedication to nurturing young talent and fostering a passion for STEAM education.

The team is an incredible story of growth and diversity. Participation has increased 50% year-over-year since the program was started, with students from diverse cultural backgrounds and genders coming together to push the boundaries of innovation. The team by the numbers:

- 60% Latinx students (80% overall diversity)
- 25% Female
- 3.5 average GPA
- 90 combined Advanced Placement (AP) and Honors Courses (avg. 3 per student)
- 100% graduation rate

Most impressive is seeing these students go straight to colleges and universities including University of California, Berkeley, Northwestern University, California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, University of California, Davis, University of California, Merced, University of California, Riverside and California State University-Sacramento with most majoring in Engineering.

It's inspiring to witness the creativity, passion, and collaboration that fuel this program's success. Having embraced Conectado’s mission “from classroom to career to the boardroom,” they are living proof of what is possible. They are Conectado!

Together with Hollister High School, we will continue to shape the next generation of leaders and innovators.

Shea also received the DEI award from the Foreign Services Program, awarded for both bringing ASL/sign language as an accepted language requirement for the program and pushing Georgetown hard to be more accessible. There were a LOT of challenges, such as showing up to events that had no ramps / ways to attend to navigating a very inaccessible campus, but Shea continued to fight to be included at every single event and classroom. This has now opened Georgetown up for the next person as they have made major improvements after working with Shea on being more accessible. 

What’s next? While searching for Shea’s next opportunity, Shea is working with a few local congressmen in Virginia on passing a BILL in Congress (being voted on shortly) for disabled people and wounded veterans to have more job opportunities in the military. Shea is also continuing to educate others on disabilities, releasing another children’s book, “Perfect Pierre” in August, about growing up with a disability with the help of Pierre and how it’s not so different as everyone has thier own challenges whether they are visible or not. 

Shea is already making huge changes in the world, and I’m so proud. I know this won’t be my last update on Shea’s accomplishments, but in the meantime….. Congratulations to Shea C.

- Mushroom lamps! That is, biofabricated lampshades grown with mushroom mycelium and hemp (MushLume Lighting)
- An AR mirror that tries on clothing for you (ZERO10) and 3D-printed clothing (Project B) – wouldn’t that make life easier!
3D-printed shoes (HILOS) and shoes made from apple skins (PROTA FIORI)
 - An AI-powered interactive version of a future me (Future You project by MIT Media Lab)
 - And finally, and perhaps most importantly: guilt-free chocolate made from plant proteins – no sugar required (Oobli)

The future of business is focused on AI, as are many of the event discussions and products to be displayed. As someone who works at a company that delivers services in the AI/ML space, I am excited to have conversations that can lead to some extraordinary ideas coming to life.

In late 2020, I became the inaugural VP/GM at 2U to launch Morehouse College Online – the online bachelor’s degree program of Morehouse College. We had examined the data and recognized that there were 3.4 million Black men over the age of 25 in the U.S. that had some college credit but no bachelor’s degree and we wanted to change this.

We partnered with President David Thomas and Morehouse College – the nation’s only Historically Black College and University (HBCU) dedicated to developing and educating men – to begin to address this problem by designing a high-caliber online learning experience and supportive brotherhood needed to become a Morehouse Man. We wanted to expand the genius of Morehouse College beyond the campus in Atlanta, GA and create a meaningful educational opportunity for Black talent to progress in their careers and pursue leadership positions that drive #EconomicMobility and #SocialChange.

In our first cohort in Fall 2021, we enrolled over 200 students, far beyond initial expectations!! ✨ YESTERDAY, I was filled with pride that 40 #amazing brothers from Morehouse College Online walked across the stage and received their diplomas 👨🏽‍🎓🤎 including brothers like Joe Williams! 👏🏾🙌🏾💪🏾

Although I am now a 2U alum and focused on another big problem in education – #ChronicAbsenteeism in K-12 schools – my goal is to create opportunities for our students to one day get accepted into top-ranked institutions like Morehouse College. 🙌🏾

Morehouse College Online would not have been possible without so many of my #exceptional 2U colleagues including our Co-Founder Chip Paucek, David Sutphen, Ebony Lee, Ebony N. Middleton, LMSW, CSM®, PMP®, Andre Singleton, Jeremy S., Krystal Johnson, Nicki Cornelius, Delilah Clayborne, MSW, Charsett Wright, Shaté L. Hayes and my #outstanding Morehouse colleagues including Provost Kendrick Brown, José Mallabo, Thelbert Snowden, Jr., Ed.D., Descatur ""Des"" Potier, Michael Gumm’MA, Illya E. Davis, Paula Resley, PCM, CDMP, CCMP, Jasmine Gurley, Justin Jones and many more!

Congratulations to all the brothers and graduates of Morehouse College Online!! 👏🏾👨🏽‍🎓🚀 I’m looking forward to seeing even more graduates in the future. Never underestimate what you can accomplish with intentionality, focus, and partnerships of purpose. 🙌🏾💪🏾

PS. I want to give a special shoutout to my mentee and the 92nd SGA President, Mekhi P., who graduated from the traditional Morehouse College program yesterday as well. Mekhi gave my son — an elementary school student at the time – a tour on campus a few years ago and I will never forget how much time and attention he provided him amongst a sea of high school students on that same tour. That’s just one example, but Mekhi is on the path to great things and becoming a man of consequence in this world! 👨🏽‍🎓💪🏾🚀",MISC,,,,Kirk,Kroft,Polaris,Consumer & Industrial Products,"VP, Digital Products",366,57,2,1w,,,,Kirk Kroft likes this,Likes,,2024-05-20 18:32,5/20/2024,Monday,Monday,6:32 PM,,,,,,,,,,,425,Engagement,6pm-7pm,May 2024,checked

I went back to visit my undergrad alma mater Mount Holyoke College (MHC) — a place I absolutely love. They recognized my work with an honorary doctorate in Science. Additionally, I had the honor of delivering the commencement address for the graduating class. 

The class cheered as President Danielle Holley introduced me. Being welcomed that way by the graduating class was SO heart warming. I sat in their shoes exactly 20 years ago. I remember how big that moment felt. And all those feelings came right back as I delivered my address. 

My dad traveled from India to watch me get hooded. And my 9mo watched the full ceremony very curiously. I am so lucky to have had Mount Holyoke as my launch pad. I started my journey in AI there as an undergrad under the mentorship of an amazing roboticist who’d built one of the well known early robots in the field. That early research got me a Microsoft full scholarship to fund my undergrad and the opportunity (rare back then) to take on ambitious AI research as a college sophomore/junior alongside primarily PhD students and postdocs. 

As I’ve mentored students at The Johns Hopkins University and previously at Stanford University, I realize the importance of having an environment that supports women undergrads in STEM. There are so many unsaid barriers that exist today. Because I was at MHC, I experienced very little of it. Turns out, MHC has also produced the most number of women who go onto receive PhD in STEM fields. #thankyouMHC",MISC,,,,James ,Whitfill,HornorHealth,Healthcare Providers,Senior Executive - Digital Healthcare Strategy and Operations ,511,92,3,1w,,,,James Whitfill MD MBA likes this,Likes,,2024-05-20 22:55,5/20/2024,Monday,Monday,10:55 PM,,,,,,,,,,,606,Engagement,10pm-11pm,May 2024,checked

""Don't be the exception, set the expectation.""

This week, 450 graduates will receive their diplomas from University of Southern California as part of a special ceremony focused on celebrating the unique achievements as members of the Latina/o and Hispanic community. 

For many in their family, they will be the exception, the first to graduate college — as I was in my own family. They will go on to land wonderful jobs working for great organizations — some, surely, will start-up their own companies.

I wish to share with these graduates the same encouragement I offer to the young entrepreneurs I mentor and work with at L’ATTITUDE Ventures, my venture fund that backs Latino-owned high growth startups; 27 outstanding companies, so far. 

Being the exception is something to be proud of. But your responsibility is to make this success the expectation, not the exception, for young people (of whatever background) who too seldom receive an equal share of opportunities. In other words, ""Pave it Forward."" 

Congratulations to the class of 2024!

Today, I return back to the USA after an extraordinary few weeks in the breathtaking Himalayas region. Our group of seven embarked on conquering the heights of Gokyo, Kala Patthar, and Mt. Everest Base Camp. Words cannot adequately describe the sheer magnificence of these peaks, pristine glaciers and rugged landscapes that unfolded before my eyes! With each day presenting a new formidable challenge, this arduous expedition pushed the boundaries of our endurance to the very limits. However, the rewards of this journey far outweighs the struggles and etches three invaluable lessons on my soul:

#1 - It is all about the journey
No matter how high we climbed, there was an another mountain taller and more majestic awaiting our embrace. This is the essence of our existence – a relentless pursuit of growth, a constant unraveling of new puzzles to solve, and new horizons to explore. Life's odyssey is all about the journey and not the destination. Colorful memories of people, places and moments make life extraordinary!

#2 - You are a team
Our quest of conquering peaks very much depended on the collective strength as a team. It did not matter how strong an each individual was, all that mattered was what we, as an individual, added to the team's strength. We embarked on this journey as a team, struggled as a team, and emerged victorious as a team. This experience has reaffirmed the wisdom: ""If you wish to travel swiftly, walk alone, but walk together if you seek to travel far""

#3 Mountain is you
""Mountain Is You"" – a profound quote that I read on one chalkboard instantly ignited the fire within me, reminding of the limitless power we possess as a human. No matter how towering mountains were, their altitudes remained finite. We, as a human, possessed limitless power to conquer any summit that dared to stand in our way. This realization helped propel ourselves forward, and climbing on the mountains that once seemed formidable to us. Let this be the mantra of our life too.",MISC,,,,Ron,Park,Hillhouse,Private Equity,Operating Partner,98,9,0,1w,,,,Ron Park likes this,Likes,,2024-05-21 15:26,5/21/2024,Tuesday,Tuesday,3:26 PM,,,,,,,,,,checked,107,Engagement,3pm-4pm,May 2024,checked

Unfortunately, this move isn't in the plans for my family. While I'm sad to leave behind an amazing team and the incredible projects we've worked on, I'm also excited about the new opportunities that lie ahead. I do have a few months left to find something.

I have nearly 30 years of experience in the industry, with a rich history of leading UX teams at some of the top companies in the world, including Amazon, Home Depot, PayPal, GM, and Adobe. 

My journey at Walmart as the UX Director, leading our efforts in Adtech, Supplier B2B tools, and social commerce, has been incredibly rewarding. We've built innovative platforms and consolidated tools to enhance user experiences for advertisers and suppliers alike.

I'm now actively seeking UX leadership roles, either remote or hybrid, in the Denver area. If you know of any opportunities or can connect me with someone who does, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm looking forward to bringing my expertise in e-commerce and B2B to new challenges and contributing to another amazing team.

He was the definition of a self-made man and entrepreneur. He built his company from the ground up, and instilled hard work and determination in his children. He was exacting and methodical, creative and smart, and always looking at new ventures and deals. When I told him about starting Second Curve Strategies, he was enthusiastic and proud.

Both Matt and Danna have been highly impactful, collaborative leaders at Virginia Mason Franciscan Health for a number of years, and we are proud that they are taking the next steps in their careers within our system. Matt spent the past five years leading VMFH's Mission Control and Virtual Hospital operations, turning them into hubs of efficiency and progress - but when he first joined VMFH he was a hospitalist at St. Clare, so this is a full circle moment for him. Danna was most recently market director of hospital operations for VMFH, while also serving as interim senior director of ambulatory services, medical and surgical specialties at VMMC. We are incredibly fortunate to have both of these exceptional leaders in our health system and I’m confident that they will help us better serve the growing communities in Enumclaw and Lakewood in their new roles.

The two-day event, focused on driving growth and profitability through sustainability, featured discussions on the importance of DEI in driving business performance, responsibilities of boards in governing risks and opportunities, climate change, the carbon offsets markets and the role of governments in accelerating the transition. With more than 90% of sustainability business leaders expecting climate change to impact their business model by 2050, and almost a quarter of respondents having already seen the effects of climate change on their business (according to our 2024 Sustainable Signals Report), these critical dialogues are essential to a deeper understanding of the business opportunities that exist and helping chart a path to a more sustainable future.

I am delighted to announce that I will serve as an advisor to the Global Fund within the Private Sector Advisory Group. 

The Global Fund is a worldwide partnership to defeat HIV, TB and malaria and ensure a healthier, safer, more equitable future for all. The fund raises and invests more than US$5 billion a year to fight the deadliest infectious diseases, challenge the injustice that fuels them, and strengthen health systems and pandemic preparedness in more than 100 of the hardest hit countries.

The Global Fund unites world leaders, communities, civil society, health workers and the private sector to find solutions that have the most impact, and  then take them to scale worldwide.

To achieve the greatest impact against the deadliest infectious diseases, the fund challenges power dynamics to ensure affected communities have an equal voice in the fight and an equal chance at a healthy future. 

This incredible opportunity allows me to contribute to an organization dedicated to fighting the world's most pressing health challenges and working towards a more equitable future.

I am honored to play a small role in this collective effort and look forward to collaborating with brilliant minds to drive impactful solutions.

Truett Cathy.

So many of Granddad’s ideas that may have seemed small at the time have become a big part of his legacy.

For example, once while visiting a hotel, an employee responded to his thank you with a sincere “My pleasure.” Granddad decided he wanted every Guest in our Restaurants to feel the way he felt when he heard that response, and the rest is history. Every day, thousands of Chick-fil-A Team Members tell Guests “My pleasure” when they serve them, and it’s become part of an authentic Chick-fil-A experience.

Another example is from the late 1940s when Granddad learned one of his Team Members, Eddie White, needed help attending college. So, he placed an empty mayonnaise jar on the counter of his Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, GA, for customers and other Team Members to donate toward what became Eddie White’s college fund. Eddie went on to attend Morris Brown College and had a successful teaching career, eventually serving as assistant superintendent of schools in Clayton County, GA. This year, a record $26.4 million was awarded in Chick-fil-A Remarkable Futures scholarships, making a difference in the lives of more than 14,000 Team Members.

I think the most important part of Granddad’s legacy is the Corporate Purpose he and Chick-fil-A leaders adopted decades ago, which still guides us today: To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A. 

I miss my granddad, but reminders of his legacy are with us at Chick-fil-A, not just on Founder’s Day but every day.",MISC,,,,John,Bachner,Newell Brands,Consumer & Industrial Products,"Vice President, Research & Development, Baby Business Unit and Corporate Technical COE",2663,81,66,1w,,,,John Bachner likes this,Likes,,2024-05-22 08:26,5/22/2024,Wednesday,Wednesday,8:26 AM,,,,,,,,,,,2810,Engagement,8am-9am,May 2024,checked

Both Matt and Danna have been highly impactful, collaborative leaders at Virginia Mason Franciscan Health for a number of years, and we are proud that they are taking the next steps in their careers within our system. Matt spent the past five years leading VMFH's Mission Control and Virtual Hospital operations, turning them into hubs of efficiency and progress - but when he first joined VMFH he was a hospitalist at St. Clare, so this is a full circle moment for him. Danna was most recently market director of hospital operations for VMFH, while also serving as interim senior director of ambulatory services, medical and surgical specialties at VMMC. We are incredibly fortunate to have both of these exceptional leaders in our health system and I’m confident that they will help us better serve the growing communities in Enumclaw and Lakewood in their new roles.

If you're looking to stay productive while finding your next career move, here's some tips to keep in mind:

1. Find a project you're passionate about and contribute to it 💡🧠💡 
We often lose sight of our creative ideas or projects we wanted to work on when we're full-time employees. Take the time now to pursue your passions and connect with others who share your interests.

2. Manage your time wisely ⌛⌛⌛ 
Balancing your time between projects, networking, and learning is critical. Don't aim to do it all at once. Use Sundays to set your goals and balance your time for the upcoming week.

3. Take care of your health 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️☀ 
Make time for walks to get Vitamin D and exercise regularly. Taking care of your mind and body is crucial for your progress. Being proactive about your health can help you stay focused and positive.
