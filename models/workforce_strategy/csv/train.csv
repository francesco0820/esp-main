"Divorce changes pretty much everything. Whether it's a surprise or something you're both on board with, you've gone from a ""we"" to a ""me"" "" and that can take some getting used to.
Maybe you were involved in the family finances while you were married, or maybe not. Either way, now the checkbook is in your hands. And that checkbook may look different than what you expected.
Why? Frustratingly, research shows that women's household income falls almost twice as much as men's post-split. And divorce can affect women's money in a lot of other ways, too.
That's a lot. And dealing with it is also pretty urgent. Financial instability is stressful and disruptive (especially if you're in a pretty emotional place right now).

""In terms of selecting the best course of radiation treatment post mastectomy, the results of the first-of-its-kind, FABREC study were just presented at ASTRO. This was a randomized comparison across multiple institutions of standard fractionation (25) versus shorter course (16) in the post mastectomy setting. With an average follow up for five years, the results reflected equivalence. This will allow patients to complete their course of therapy in a shorter amount of time, as well as having fewer side effects. Skin toxicity in late term fibrosis are also substantially better with shorter fractionation as demonstrated in the study.""

The report finds that Africa's growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But there's no "" one Africa.' Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from what's working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sector""even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010""it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets won't be easy, especially amid today's headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continent""and the global economy""thrive.

"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
""For early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
""Additionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.""
At HealthHelp, our evidence-based guidelines prioritize what's best for the patient. By staying up-to-date with the latest research and medical practices, we ensure that every decision made is in the best interest of the patient's well-being.

Mindfulness and Mindful interactions
As I have observed, the pandemic has left us with many learnings and some new habits! The habit that has formed and its permissibility seems widely accepted "" is that we can multi task during meetings and interactions, especially those that are screen based - remote, virtual, or hybrid.
The multi tasking habit or sickness, is where our eyes (and our mind) no longer needs to be attending to the colleague or guest we have in a given meeting or interaction
Do you all see that?
I see that a lot and I have made a personal decision to not subscribe to it!
Pre "" Pandemic, our meetings were predominantly physical, and we were taking notes, watching the presentation, making eye contact, etc. Today, I find that in many meetings, multi tasking by way of reviewing another screen has become table stakes. Permissible.
Mindfulness is a much larger topic and quality of meetings, plenty has been said about it!
Yet, (limiting my comments to the workplace), giving undivided attention or at least making every effort to do so "" has to be table stakes.
During video meetings, it is blatantly clear when the other party is not giving full attention. Roving eyes, tilted views of the head to view multiple screens, etc. I have recently observed this even during candidate interviews, which my career lessons speak to sacrosanct focus as table stakes!
If we are aware of this and no longer bothered by it, therein lies the assumed permissibility and personally, I am not subscribing to!
If I am an invitee or attendee, I am sticking to the full immersion rule..
If I am the meeting organizer, as I say to my teams : I am ready to have as long or as short of a meeting, as is supported by our mutually focused and undistracted engagement with each other.
When we are primed for a mindset of total immersion, it is no longer difficult to give our undivided attention during interactions.

Layoffs can create an atmosphere of stress and anxiety in the workplace. Employees, if not reassured, constantly worry they may be next. Doing nothing to assuage fears can degrade trust in management, leading to employees quitting because they feel unsupported by their work environment.

-- ChristianaCare is the Delaware Branch Campus for Thomas Jefferson University's Sidney Kimmel Medical College (SKMC) and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM).
-- Since 2013, ChristianaCare has had almost 220 students at the branch campus, more than half with a direct Delaware connection. Dozens of those students received their medical education through the support of the Delaware Institute for Medical Education and Research (DIMER), a program that ensures Delawareans get access to high-quality medical education at SKMC or PCOM. This program is an excellent value for Delaware, because it provides a high-quality medical education pipeline at costs well below what it would take to support a brick-and-mortar medical school in Delaware.

The combination of wonderful weather, outdoors activity, wildlife and quality time with the family was the perfect tonic. I feel refreshed and energised, ready to forge ahead. Just before I left I spoke with Financial News's Penny Sukhraj about Oliver Wyman's journey. In a wide-ranging and engaging chat, recharging was one of the topics we discussed.
While the article is behind a paywall, I'd like to reflect on some of its messages. As per the headline, ten years ago we had the humility to know who we were and what we were, and weren't, good at. I'm deeply proud of how we've grown, how our teams have built incredible relationships and trust with our clients, and how we've expanded our expertise to confidently compete and succeed in supporting clients in a wider range of their transformative moments. But at the same time we need to continue to ask demanding questions of ourselves and to try to maintain that humility as a core value that is necessary for ongoing development.
The article also discusses my views on the need to work together in person. Our first principle is that we will be wherever our clients need us to be, but beyond that I am a big believer in the hybrid working model. We have been aiming for 50% in person and are now looking to tweak that up to an average of three days a week (which is actually close to our recent average in three of our regions).
We need to ensure a vibrant team culture with high quality apprenticeship and stretching personal development which is better in person, as well as to maintain the benefits we have all gained by being able to be more flexible and to work remotely some of the time.

"Out today, Cisco's #Cybersecurity Readiness Index highlights that only 15% of organizations have a cybersecurity posture that's mature enough to defend against the threats of a hybrid world. We measured the cybersecurity readiness of companies across five key pillars - identity, devices, network, application workloads, and data - and the results were clear: no matter what kind of business you operate and no matter where you are in the world, security resilience is imperative in today's world.
At first this may sound frightening, and it's true that we're facing a threat landscape that's more expansive than we've ever seen, with attack methods changing at a rapid pace and bad actors getting more sophisticated. In fact, 82% of leaders expect a cybersecurity incident to disrupt their business within the next two years. We've been living and working in new ways for over three years, and we know people, devices, workloads, and applications will continue to be more and more distributed moving forward. Organizations are accelerating their multi-cloud adoption more quickly than many expected. In this dynamic environment, a number of my peers have expressed that they don't worry about if a breach will happen, but when.
But despite so much uncertainty, I remain optimistic. I believe the data highlights the opportunities that exist for the public and private sectors to work together to close the readiness gap. With tighter alignment and partnership, we can truly reap all the benefits of our connected world, without fear of disruption. We all depend on a secure world, and if we share threat intelligence, cooperate on legislation to keep everyone safe, and rally around the idea that security and privacy are human rights, we can realize a truly secure and inclusive future for all.
As the builders of the internet, security remains critical for Cisco's business and our ability to support our customers' resilience. Our team is dedicated to building the simple, intelligent, interoperable, and platform-driven solutions our customers demand today and will need tomorrow.

"I asked a generative AI program to write a LinkedIn post about a current tech policy trend. As you can see, AI won't be ascending to the throne of thought leader anytime soon; the post is primarily a fluffed regurgitation of facts. Not bad for some surface-level online engagement, but does it have any unique, thought-provoking perspective? Is it *saying* anything, or is it just *reciting*?
In its current state, generative AI should be considered a tool, not a one-stop shop. These tools could be useful for trend analysis or background research, which can then be incorporated into an individual's own thought leadership. But as companies start rolling out new uses for AI in their business, remember the one thing we all have that this tech doesn't: our own unique voice.
There are estimates saying generative AI could become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, so this is definitely an area to keep a very close eye on.

"For the 20th time Roche is conducting its annual Children's Walk! Y...
What started in 2003 as a small walk of a few employees became Roche's largest employee engagement and philanthropic event. Since the first walk more than 294,000 Roche employees have raised over CHF 22 million in donations for children's projects around the world. Each year employees from Informatics, Finance and all other functions from more than 60 countries across the globe come together for this important cause.
Through the Roche Employee Action & Charity Trust (Re&Act) and with partners like UNICEF, Roger Federer Foundation, and Child's Dream, >1 million children have benefited from educational programmes across Ethiopia, Malawi, Cambodia, Nepal and the Philippines.
I am proud that we are celebrating 20 years of impact and the difference Roche employees worldwide are making. To the next 20 years!

"Amazon today announced the completion of their acquisition of One Medical weeks after CVS Health announced the acquisition of Oak Street Health.
These deals have the potential to be transformative for the healthcare industry and for patients""and both companies have world-class operating executives in place to shepherd the acquisitions in Amir Dan Rubin and Amar A. Desai, MD, MPH.
That said, the history of big publicly-traded companies owning health care delivery has been mixed""at best.
In order for these deals to live of to their potential, both corporations will need to commit to something that is often unnatural in publicly-traded companies.
Namely, a distinctive operating culture within the context of a much broader organization whose products and services are largely unlike.
Some key imperatives:
Avoid the temptation for corporate conformity: no one likes to hear this, but healthcare delivery is different. HR process, compliance requirements, financial management""all require a different lens. Big companies who do similar sounding and related but fundamentally different things (health insurance v health care delivery; pharmacy v primary care) tend to demand and expect homogeneity, sometimes to the detriment of the acquired entity.
Remember that in healthcare delivery, patients always have to come before profit: this isn't corporate pablum but the most fundamental tenet of healthcare delivery. Organizations lose the hearts and minds of the front line (where the true value is created) when short-term thinking mortgages the long-term prospects. Scarcity of resources and the drive towards earnings can lead to anti-patient activities that erode morale and destroy long-term value.
Focus on talent retention: in clinical companies, the product is the clinician-patient relationships. Big companies tend to treat frontline workers like they are interchangeable parts. This is a losing strategy in healthcare where the patient's allegiance to the doctor trumps their allegiance to the company, the health system, pharmacy, or the health insurer.
Remember to be relentless in connecting the dots: these deals were built on the premise that 1+1 could equal 3. Amazon could potentially connect its Prime services with its primary care capabilities. CVS its pharmacy with its primary care. These connection points represent the innovation promise of these deals. But because of the silos that exist in large corporations, these are often the opportunities that get shelved most quickly. Corporate politics and fiefdoms get in the way of true value creation.
Leadership from the top will matter a lot. The tendency to tell leaders to ""figure it out"" won't be enough. There will need to be clear direction from the CEOs of both corporations""Andy Jassy and Karen S. Lynch""and the kind of upfront problem-solving that happens far too rarely in big corporations.
Time will tell if they can get it right. I sincerely hope they do.",Workforce strategy

"Employers added a better-than-expected 253,000 jobs in April, but the revisions of gains from March and February "" totaling 149,000 jobs "" illustrate a labor market that is strong but moderating. There remain about 1.6 jobs for each available worker.
Given recent mass layoff announcements, the report today may seem somewhat contradictory. The reality is that remote and hybrid work has forever changed the rules, timing, place and pace of work, and caused many organizations to realign their workforce strategies. Industry group Staffing Industry Analysts expects the use of contingent workers in workforce composition to increase from 21% today to nearly 30% over the next 10 years. Our own research supports this trend, as we found that outside talent makes up 45% of critical project teams today and is expected to grow to 48% by 2024.
