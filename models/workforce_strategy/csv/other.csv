I was heartened to meet with community members who have taken on incredible leadership roles to support their neighbors and was inspired by the resilient people I met along the way.

"Last week I returned from a trip to Senegal, Ghana, and Niger. Joined by VP of Global Partnerships and Impact Tawanda Future Mutasah Mutasah and Board Chair Jamey Shachoy, we visited projects and met with partners, staff, and public figures. I came away feeling inspired and with a deep appreciation for the impactful work we are doing in these contexts. Here are some of my highlights:
--In Senegal, I witnessed the power of Oxfam as a convener and was privileged to be part of an inequality forum with other government and NGO leaders. The atmosphere was vibrant, with people coming together to address crucial issues of extreme inequality, gender justice, climate justice, and humanitarian aid in the Sahel.
--In Bargny, a coastal community south of Dakar, one woman activist shared her heartbreaking experience of losing her home to sea-level rise and erosion. She and other displaced families were promised land to resettle, only to have the government grant that land to a foreign company to build a coal-burning power plant instead. Despite the adversity, unshakable activists in the community were fighting for their rights, and Oxfam and our partners were there to support them.
--In Ghana, I was deeply impressed by our work in bringing civil society together on critical issues such as human rights, shrinking civic space, debt sustainability, and conflicts arising from land use between cocoa and mining. We had meetings with the Commissioner of Human Rights and Administrative Justice and with the International Monetary Fund Resident.
--In transit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, en route to Niger, I could not help noticing the fleet of helicopters and planes of the World Food Programmeâ€”a stark reminder of the food insecurity prevalent in the region. In Niger, this context was front of mind during meetings with Prime Minister Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou, to discuss critical issues of security, humanitarian assistance, and civic space.
As I head into meetings in DC, I will bring these experiences with me and advocate for the people I just met. I will focus on coastal erosion and natural resource exploitation in Senegal, inequality and human rights priorities in Ghana, the closing of civic space in Niger, and the extreme food insecurity in the region.",MISC

Thank you to Stephanie Sassman and Professor George Serafeim for the great talk and for bringing unique perspectives from Women's Health as well as research to the table! Big thanks also to the organizing team, very well done!
One of the most important topics we discussed was purpose versus profit which actually is purpose AND profit. My key takeaway for Roche and our industry is that if we want to make healthcare sustainable, we need profits in order to fund R&D. Without profits, we cannot invest and ensure we are doing now what patients need next. Moreover, purpose needs to have an exciting and energizing element.

- AI-driven data collection tools have made it possible to efficiently gather and analyse vast amounts of data that enable us to make faster and more informed decisions
- AI-driven automation has significantly reduced the administrative burden on our teams

"""The pursuit of profit with purpose requires patience,"" reminds George Serafeim in his article for Financial Times that illuminates the evolving dynamics between business aspirations and societal change.
In a world quick to mythologize the binaries of purpose and profit, George Serafeim underscores the potential harmony of the two. Drawing attention to the evolving landscape, he emphasizes that our aspirations to integrate purpose in business might challenge us, but it's an effort deeply entrenched in possibility. As he notes, ""It is a myth that the pursuit of purpose in business is futile because it is antithetical to profit.""

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential, and are revolutionising the way we innovate and transform the healthcare industry in particular. As the CIO/CFO at Roche, I am thrilled to witness the paradigm shift these technologies are bringing to our work.
AI has evolved tremendously, and the advent of LLMs opened up a number of new possibilities. At Roche, we are leveraging the power of AI and LLMs to fuel our research and development efforts. The ability to gain productivity, support data collection, fuel knowledge management, and accelerate drug discovery is transforming the landscape of healthcare. We are empowered to explore new hypotheses, access cutting-edge information, and make informed decisions faster and more efficient than ever before.
As part of the Informatics Strategy, and to ensure that we are the drivers of cutting-edge technology at Roche, we have taken a first step toward defining our global AI strategy. We see a huge potential in seizing this opportunity to push the boundaries of innovation, unlock new horizons, and create a better future for all.

"Pharma AI Readiness Index!
I. The Index
The Pharma AI Readiness Index assesses how prepared top pharmaceutical companies are to adopt and respond to rapidly evolving AI technologies
II. Key Pillars
1. Talent
The talent score measures a pharmaceutical companyâ€™s ability to attract and retain AI specialists (employee headcount and key AI hires)
-> The top-ranking pharma companies in the analysis have established AI disciplines with clear leadership mandates â€” led by individuals with extensive academic or industry experience â€” and targeted hiring in technical roles
2. Execution
The execution score measures a pharmaceutical companyâ€™s ability to bring AI-powered products and services to market, as well as deploy AI internally across corporate functions (business relationships, product launch media mentions, and earnings transcripts)
-> Half of the 50 largest pharma companies have entered into partnership or licensing agreements with AI companies. 23 out of the 50 companies have mentioned AI on earnings calls at least once over the past 5 years
3. Innovation
The innovation score measures a pharmaceutical companyâ€™s track record of developing or acquiring novel AI capabilities (patents, acquisitions, and dealmaking activity)
-> Only 3 of the 50 largest pharma companies have made an AI acquisition. And just 5 account for over half of all AI investments made since 2018

We will continue delivering on our promise of patient-centricity also in an ever changing environment, especially when it comes to digital transformation. Roche plays a decisive role in shaping this transformation as the only company that unites pharma, diagnostics, health data, and digitalisation under one roof. This puts us in a unique position to help patients get diagnosed and cured as early as possible.

"Very excited that the 2023 annual members' meeting of The Alliance for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare (AAIH) on â€œRedefine AIâ€ will be held on our Roche Genentech campus from May 17-18, hosted by Mustaqhusain Kazi.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) finds applications across the entire value chain in healthcare: From designing products, identifying targets for drug development, optimizing clinical trials, enhancing customer experience to personalizing medicine based on patient data.
We in Informatics are the drivers of technology at Roche. To deliver on this requires us to stay on top of the newest technologies and key topics such as AI through exchanges with other thought leaders. The AAIH will provide a great opportunity to join keynotes and panel discussions - I look forward to hearing the outcomes!

"Today, Roche published its financial results for the first quarter of 2023. We recorded strong sales growth in the base business of both Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. As expected, we see a significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests which led to a decrease in Group sales.
I am very proud that at Roche, our strategy remains the unwavering focus on innovation. We again increased our R&D investments to more than CHF14 bn last year which has placed us as the pharma industry's #1 investor in R&D. We expect to increase this number further in 2023. Advancing science in service of patients and earning a return on our investments are two sides of the same coin and key pillars of a sustainable business model.
Thank you to everyone at Roche for your dedication and hard work to do now what patients need next - every day. It is a real privilege to be part of this team!

- Pfizer is harnessing generative AI to innovate in such areas as scientific and medical content generation, identifying new oncology targets, creating drafts of patent applications, and manufacturing. We estimate that some of the priority use cases will generate cost savings from $750 million to $1 billion annually.
- We are also applying AI to generate alerts about events that could disrupt our supply chain. For example, one alert prompted us to re-route shipments so we could continue delivering medicines to clinical trial sites ahead of Hurricane Ian.
- AI is critical to realizing our ambitious goal of launching 19 new products or indications over a roughly 18-month periodâ€”a feat that has never been accomplished before, by any company. We expect the myriad benefits of AI to enable us to bring medicines and vaccines to patients quicker than ever before, setting new standards for healthcare innovation and access.",MISC

In the first nine months of 2023, more than 457 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. And compared with the first nine months of 2022, we have reached more patients this year in several key therapeutic areasâ€”including oncology, cardiovascular disease and anti-infectives. While we saw an expected decline in revenues from our COVID-19 products during the quarter, we were encouraged by the continued strong performance of Pfizerâ€™s non-COVID products, with revenue from these products growing 10% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter.
We also continue to progress toward our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. To date, we have executed 13 of 19 potential launches, with four more products approved and being prepared for launch. Among these launches are some historic firsts, such as the first and only RSV vaccine approved for the prevention of RSV in older adults and in infants via maternal immunization, and the first and only approved meningococcal vaccine for the prevention of the five most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease that provides the broadest coverage in adolescents and young adults 10 to 25 years of age.

Under this agreement, by January 2024, our oral treatment will be offered through commercial channels, not just the emergency federal channels created and used by the US government during the pandemic. As a result, more pharmacies, clinics and other healthcare sites are expected to be able to stock this treatment, making it more accessible for eligible patients across the US.
In addition, on behalf of the federal government, Pfizer will set up a patient assistance program for the uninsured and underinsured through 2028. Patients insured through federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will continue to receive treatment free of charge in 2024.

"As I prepare for the 2023 APEC CEO Summit, whatâ€™s top of mind for me is the danger exclusion poses to our society and our world. In fact, there may be nothing more urgent than the need to create a world that is rich with inclusion. I believe that many of our most urgent problems stem from the absence of inclusionâ€”the heartbreaking sense of isolation or othernessâ€”and the solutions to these problems will depend on fostering inclusion for those who have been robbed of it. Rarely have we seen a world with so many challenges at one time as we do now, yet for all their particulars and complexities, these challenges all have exclusion at their root.
Leaders of the business community all have the meansâ€”and obligationâ€”to address these challenges. At this yearâ€™s hashtag#APECCEOSummitUSA, I hope to impress upon my peers in the room the importance of this work. Whether it is through partnerships, policies or practices that promote inclusion, we have a responsibility to build inclusive ecosystems that are not only good for the business world, but more importantly good for society. This Wednesday, I look forward to sharing more of my thoughts, and the potential solutions to the Exclusion Epidemic.",DEI
"For #WomensHistoryMonth month, I want to share an amazing conversation with some inspiring colleagues.
In 2021, Pfizer launched the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiative, a program that supports the economic inclusion of refugees and other displaced people through hiring, mentoring and advocating. Our initial goal was to hire 100 refugees and to mentor 150 by the end of 2022â€”and we surpassed that goal in just one year. We have now extended our goal and committed to hiring 500 refugees by the end of 2025.
Through this program, we welcomed our colleagues Baheshta Abed Rahimi, and Najlla Habibyar. In the latest episode of our series, â€œSomething's Brewing: Coffee and Conversation,â€ my colleague Mona Babury, CDP, PMPâ€”a pillar of the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiativeâ€”spoke with Najilla and Bahesta about their unique journeys, the challenges they have faced, and how theyâ€™re building their futures at Pfizer.

"We're committed to closing the health equity gap around the world. Thatâ€™s why, today, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Pfizer announced a substantial expansion in our commitment to An Accord for a Healthier World to offer the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines for which we have global rights to enable greater access for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries. This greatly expands our initial commitment to offer all of our patented medicines and vaccines available in the U.S. or EU to include off-patent medicines, as well. It brings our portfolio offering on a not-for-profit basis to the 45 lower-income Accord countries from 23 to around 500 products. In just the first seven months since the launch of the Accord, weâ€™ve made important progress. Weâ€™ve delivered our first shipments of Pfizer medicines and vaccines to Rwanda, supported healthcare trainings and deployed a Global Health Team to help identify opportunities for long-term supply chain optimization. Weâ€™re now in advanced discussions with 16 other countries around access and health systems support. Itâ€™s this type of cooperation that is so critical to creating sustainable access and resilient health ecosystems that will bring long-term health and prosperity to many. These are just our first steps. We know that we have a long way to go before we can reach our goal, but we are proud of the progress we are making, and we are grateful to the governments and others that share our collective mission.

"It has been a challenging few days since our Rocky Mount, North Carolina facility was severely damaged by a tornado on Wednesday. Thankfully, no one was injured or harmed. I was on the ground today with our local team, lending support where I can, and meeting with Pfizer colleagues and elected officials to determine our way forward.
Our Rocky Mount site manufactures 8% of the sterile injectable medicines used in US hospitals, so we know that many patients depend on us. Our colleagues have been working around the clock to get us back online as quickly and safely as possible. While we still have a great deal of work ahead of us, I know that we will persevere with the full power of Pfizerâ€™s purpose and people behind this effort.
Clearly nature is powerfulâ€”but so too is ingenuity and the human spirit. I have witnessed firsthand the resilience of the local community and seen the selfless ways people have helped each other.

"Today, I shared Pfizerâ€™s 2022 Q4 financial results. I am tremendously proud of what we have accomplished this past year. In addition to a record-breaking financial performance, we maintained our industry-leading clinical success rates and were named to 10 different â€œbest employerâ€ lists, including those published by LinkedIn, Forbes, Glassdoor, and others. Most important, more than 1.3 billion patients* around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccinesâ€”a number that truly humbles me.
We are in the midst of an 18-month period during which we could have up to an unprecedented 19 potential new products or indications in the market. Most of these are from our internal pipeline, while the remaining four come from recent business development dealsâ€”and nearly all are for indications outside of COVID-19.
We are at an inflection point as a company, one in which we have an incredibly robust R&D pipeline with more than enough capital to invest in additional potential opportunities. And we will not hesitate to invest, because at the end of the day, what truly matters is those 1.3 billion patients treated with our medicines and vaccinesâ€”and doing everything possible to reach even more patients.

This important organization consists of more than 90 pharmaceutical companies and associations and works closely with the United Nations to advance global health through discovering, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines. This talented group of colleagues is as passionate as I am about improving the lives of people everywhere.
If there is one thing that the past three years taught us, it is that nothing is impossible. I believe the things we accomplished during that period are just the start of a scientific renaissance, one in which previously unimaginable therapies and medicines can be discovered, developed, and delivered to patients more quickly than ever before. Over the coming decades, all of us in the life sciences sector hope to deliver game-changing innovations to address some of the worldâ€™s most devastating diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological and muscular disorders.
That is what excites me the most about the presidency of the IFPMA: it is an unparalleled opportunity to make real, lasting and positive changes in the field of healthcareâ€”so that the health issues that vex us today will be ancient history for our children and grandchildren.

"Today, February 24, 2023, marks a somber milestone. Russian forces invaded Ukraine on this day one year ago, triggering a humanitarian crisis that has created ripples of fear, despair and devastation worldwide. Weâ€™ve lost many innocent people, and weâ€™ve watched global geopolitical tension escalate.
When the international community made the decision to implement unprecedented sanctions against Russia, most sanctions and export control restrictions contained exclusions for the provision of medicine. In addition, Pfizer recognized that halting the delivery of medicine, including cancer or cardiovascular therapies, to Russia would cause significant patient suffering and potential loss of life. Ending Pfizer operations in Russia would run counter to our guiding principle of putting patients first.
Yet business in Russia could not then, and cannot now, continue as usual. Last year, on March 14, we announced that Pfizer would donate the equivalent of all profits from our sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Since announcing that commitment, we have committed more than $30 million to 15 unique organizations, each of which provides on-the-ground humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine.
As the war continues, the global community has a responsibility to ensure support to Ukraine continues unabated. We remain hopeful that a peaceful outcome is possible. Our support remains steadfast and consistent with Pfizerâ€™s core values, particularly those of courage, excellence and equity.

"Iâ€™m immensely proud to celebrate our new Pfizer world headquarters in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City. And Iâ€™m honored that Mayor Eric Adams joined us for this special occasion.
Pfizer has been headquartered in New York City for nearly 175 years. Our co-founders, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, immigrated from Germany to the U.S. in 1848. They opened the first Pfizer location in Brooklyn the following year, where they began producing the companyâ€™s first medical breakthrough by blending an antiparasitic called santonin with almond-toffee flavoring to make it more palatable for patients.
Hudson Yards is actually the fourth NYC neighborhood we have called home since then, but our commitment to this amazing city has never wavered. Over the years, Pfizer colleagues have volunteered with many local organizations. One great example is our partnership with the Hudson Guild where, since 2018, our colleagues have logged more than 2,400 volunteer hours at more than 25 Hudson Guild events.
Last summer, Pfizer announced a $1.5 million grant to the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, with funds earmarked for STEM educational programs for middle and high school students. We did this because we are passionate about introducing the cityâ€™s young students to careers in the life sciences. This vision is also now coming to life at the Pfizer School of Science, an immersive field trip experience for New York City students where they get to interact withâ€”and learn fromâ€”Pfizer scientists.
This is only the beginning. Over the next two decades, I firmly believe weâ€™ll be living through a scientific renaissance, where the seemingly impossible will become possible in healthcare. I couldnâ€™t be more excited for this future, and New York City continues to be the perfect place for us to be as we work to it a reality.",MISC

"#HealthEquity is a topic that is always top of mind for us at Pfizer. A few weeks ago, I discussed global health equity in terms of access and partnerships. Here, our Chief People Experience Officer, Payal Sahni, shares her thoughts on how non-healthcare professionals and organizations can help drive health equity through workforce cultures and business actions.",Health outcomes
"This article is the second of a two-part series in which I examine global health inequity in low- and middle-income countries. In the first article, I focused on access to medicines and vaccines, and how Pfizer is helping to improve access. In this article, I look at public-private partnerships (PPPs) between the pharmaceutical industry and other organizations, and how PPPs are working to help close health equity gaps. #HealthForAll",Health outcomes
"AI holds the potential to completely disrupt every industry, but none more so than medicine. In healthcare, AI will mean more breakthroughs delivered to more people, more quickly.
Yesterday, I attended #DHNY23 for the first time, where we discussed the impact of data and digital technology on drug discovery. I believe that over the next two decades, we will see advances in biology and technology have a dramatic positive impact on human healthâ€”a time where we can hopefully cure many currently incurable conditions, transform others into manageable chronic disease, and be better prepared for future pandemics.
Digital advances are revolutionizing every aspect of healthcare, and my Pfizer colleagues and I are excited to harness these advances to help achieve our goal of significantly improving human health for everyone on the globe.",Data privacy and cybersecurity
"I recently had the great pleasure of joining a panel at the Black Corporate Directors Conference to talk about the importance of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world, particularly in the healthcare industry. The Conference serves as a dynamic forum for African-American and Hispanic/Latino directors at Fortune 500 companies to come together and have meaningful discussions about minority representation across all sectors.
At Pfizer, equity is one of our core values, and we constantly strive to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. We do so because itâ€™s the right thing to doâ€”the human thing to do. But itâ€™s also a smart business strategy, as research shows that DEI has beneficial impacts on business results. For example, the World Economic Forum found that companies that are DEI leaders have up to 20% higher rates of innovation than market average.
Nowhere is equity more important than in the area of healthcare. As the leader of a major healthcare company, I see it as my responsibility to help drive important and lasting changes that close gaps in health equity. That is why my teams are working hard to remove barriers to access and representation in R&D and in clinical trials, and to build trust in minority and undeserved/underrepresented communities.
Equity doesnâ€™t mean giving everyone the same thing. It means working to level the playing field for everyoneâ€”from corporate offices to doctorsâ€™ offices, and everywhere in between. Together we can create a better future for patients from all backgrounds.",DEI
"It is an exciting time for patients living with cancer around the world and for Pfizer. Today, we announced the proposed acquisition of Seagen, a pioneer in antibody-drug conjugate technology (or ADC), which is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool in cancer treatment.
Oncology is a core therapeutic area for Pfizer, and the proposed combination with Seagen will strengthen our capabilities in this rapidly evolving and important space.
Over the past few years, Pfizer delivered to the world breakthrough solutions that have helped bring an end to the COVID-19 crisis â€“ and now weâ€™re ready to do the same with cancer. With COVID-19, we chose the right novel technology (mRNA) and the right partner (BioNTech), and then applied the scale and power of Pfizerâ€™s capabilities to deliver solutions to patients worldwide. We believe we can do this again with cancer by using another novel technology (ADCs) and bringing the worldâ€™s best ADC company (Seagen) into Pfizer, enabling us to accelerate the next generation of potential breakthroughs for patients living with cancer.
ADCs are designed to harness the targeting power of antibodies to deliver small molecule drugs to the tumor. This innovative approach to therapy can offer meaningful efficacy, with the goal of limiting certain side effects for patients.
Check out this video to learn more about the potential of ADCs and how our proposed acquisition of Seagen could help us transform the future of cancer care:",MISC
"Today is World Health Day, and this yearâ€™s theme is #HealthforAllâ€”which aligns perfectly with our core value of equity. We believe that every person should be seen, heard and cared for, but we know there is a lot to do before that is possible. Here are some of the ways weâ€™re working to make a difference:
- As of March 12, 2023, we have delivered more than 4.5 billion doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to 181 countries and territories in every region of the world. This includes nearly 1.8 billion doses to low- and middle-income countries.
- Through the Pfizer Refugee Leadership Initiative, we continue to hire refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other parts of the worldâ€”helping them rebuild their careers, their homes and their health. And last April, I joined 34 other CEOs to launch the Welcome.US CEO Council, pledging more than $75 million to support refugee resettlement organizations and non-profits to welcome Afghan and Ukrainian refugees coming to the U.S.
- Through An Accord for a Healthier World, we're offering the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines that we have global rights to on a not-for-profit basis to 45 lower-income countries, while also collaborating with governments and global health leaders to address gaps in diagnosis, education, infrastructure, storage and more to enhance access to our products for those who need them. The World Health Organization has found that 30% of the global population is not able to access essential health services. I know every single one of my colleagues shares my view that that is unacceptableâ€”so every day, we come to work determined to help keep people healthy by discovering and delivering breakthroughs to everyone, everywhere.",Health outcomes

"I sometimes think of the Federal Reserve as akin to the nation's air traffic control. Just as we hope experienced controllers with good technology can keep airplanes from colliding, we expect the Fed's expertise and models will keep our economy from crashing. Yesterday, data showed that the US unemployment rate is at a 54 year low of 3.4%. This is good news in that it underscores recession clouds are not building. But, this is bad news because it basically means the Fed has lost track of where the planes are flying.

"The allegory of Plato's Cave is one of my favorites -- it highlights the difference between the â€œrealityâ€ of peopleâ€™s sensory understandings compared to real knowledge. Until recently, the topic of ESG has been stuck in a similar cave, where it is hard to tell what is real and what is rhetoric. Today, Novata released the broadest collection of ESG benchmarks in the private markets. Now, there are accurate examples of what good looks like across hundreds of critical measures. This means ESG metrics can finally be effectively linked to financial materiality, which is how we reframe the ESG debateâ€”not through discord, but with data.

"Navigating the alphabet soup of ESG-related standards and frameworks has always been a difficult task.

My Novata colleague Stephen Cain and I took a crack at boiling down the soup to its base.

"Letter to Harvard University President Gay:
Dear President Gay:
I am an alumnus of Harvard College 1992, Government. My tutor and thesis advisor was Dame Louise Richardson, who I am sure you know went on to be the head of Oxford and whose academic scholarship is on terrorism. I am also an Israeli citizen and reside in Israel for the past 20 years. This week, my best friends lost their son fighting Hamas terrorists, another colleague lost his elderly parent to Hamas butchery and friends have a son who attended the rave party, was severely wounded and is held in Gaza by Hamas. There were 13 funerals in my relatively small city Raâ€™anana this week alone.
I am deeply troubled by what is missing in your statements around these terrorist events. You condemn the Hamas barbarism, but you speak mostly about listening to each other in the Harvard community. While that is important, now is a time for you as the leader of Harvard to speak much more clearly and forcefully against terror. Harvard does not only exist to foster dialogue among its students. Harvardâ€™s alumni and students, certainly of the Government department and the Law, Business and Kennedy Schools, are and will be leaders of governments, corporations, international organizations, etc. Harvardâ€™s mission is to create actors, not only talkers, on the world stage as a force for good.
In order to do this, as Harvardâ€™s leader you must speak more forcefully and unequivocally. Not just to condemn the barbarism. Your message should be clear and unequivocal, not just to support Israeli victims, but to SAVE GAZA AND THE PALESTINIANS FROM HAMAS! Hamasâ€™s horrific crimes against Israelis this week and over the years are secondary only to their horrific crimes against their own people since their founding. They have singlehandedly (alongside Islamic Jihad) and too effectively prolonged the Palestinian Israeli conflict, wreaked death and destruction among their people all while profiting â€“ be it in capital for their leadership or murderous suicide missions for their nihilistic ideology. They threaten to drag the world into a global conflict. This is all historical truth, not perspective. Harvard must stand for truth.
Palestinians who say that Hamas represent them have made a clear choice â€“ they choose and support terrorism - that Harvard must reject. You can make a difference if you are clearer about the Universityâ€™s position. This is a time for moral clarity to prevail. Harvard is a bastion of education. Harvard leadership should be screaming from the top of its lungs â€“ end the education of hate and antisemitism that Hamas and Islamic Jihad have perpetrated to Palestinian children for decades. Hamas has brought ruin to the Palestinian cause, to the cause of peace and co-existence. That message must be clear to the entire educated world, and you should lead it. Please consult Dame Richardson and her 2006 book What Terrorists Want. There is much to learn from her.

"A very big â€˜thank youâ€™ to Christine Winoto, Richard Lungen, HC9 Ventures, and the team at the UCSF Rosenman Institute for inviting me to moderate a panel on â€œCooking Up New Payment Modelsâ€ in healthcare.
I was incredibly fortunate to have a star-studded panel of Ali Khan, MD, MPP, Beth Andersen, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Romilla Batra, MD, MBA, which enabled us to cover a wide range of approaches to the topic of paymentâ€”and how various payment modelsâ€”affect prices and patient care across both government and private healthcare.
Whatâ€™s clear is that all of us on all sides of the healthcare marketâ€”payers, providers, employers, regulatorsâ€”can learn a lot from each other and need to act in a more coordinated fashion. Healthcare (and how much it costs) impacts each and every one of us, directly and indirectly, and we canâ€™t continue reimbursing care in one part of the market (e.g., Medicare) without thoroughly thinking through the implications in other parts of the market (e.g., employer-sponsored healthcare).

"The biggest news in AI this week was the new White House Executive Order. This is a balanced and accessible summary by one of the best tech/platform analysts. We will be watching closely as the implications are unpacked by the business, policy and academic communities. In the mean time, I have a few high level comments:
(1) It is true that regulation sometimes can have unintended consequences. And the US has generally benefited from a light regulatory agenda in enabling new technology innovation. But it does seem like the stakes are sufficiently high that some oversight - balanced with appropriate humility about how much is not yet known - is in order. I don't share the â€œmust avoid any regulation for this rapidly evolving spaceâ€ view of some folks in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, or the cynical view that this is just regulatory capture by some early movers in AI.
(2) It is an executive order and doesn't carry the weight or permanence of a law passed by Congress. With that said, it is definitely not nothing. As Casey notes, it has significant breadth and depth. The model size thresholds will allow smaller/open source players to avoid much of the scrutiny the operators of the largest proprietary models will be subject to. Seems like a reasonable approach, even though it is hard to know if they drew the line in the right place, and the line will need to be revisited over time.
(3) While the US have briefly taken the regulatory initiative here, I expect the EU will reclaim it soon - and with more teeth, less concern for throttling innovation and a desire to support/favor an emerging AI industry in Europe.
(4) The executive order does not address some of the bigger commercial issues related to copyright and fair use. Negotiations are already under way between major rights holders and platforms, and I expect that can be solved without much government intervention. The big issue will be smaller individual rights holders.
(5) The content/media authenticity/deep fake issue is moving so fast I worry it could overwhelm democratic processes. We already saw deep fakes affect the recent election in Slovakia, and as the President noted, it is now trivial to create synthetic media that (almost) perfectly impersonates anyone. I hope the Commerce Dept plans to work closely with industry to develop watermarking and other standards.
At DocuSign, we believe AI will transform how agreements are created, negotiated, executed and managed. As the leader in both e-signature and contract lifecycle management, we are benefitting from years of experience in developing AI functionality, a deep understanding of agreements and a position of trust with our customers. We leverage the best public cloud models, open source models, internal model development and proprietary data, including access (with consent) to the one of the largest sets of agreement data in the industry. Please join us. #docusign",Regulation/Legislation

In essence, it demonstrated a leap frog in rocket payload and efficiency, which when perfected would enable human travel to Mars and radical transformation of cross ocean airfreight. The first 30 minutes of the last episode of the All-In Pod covered this and included a SpaceX board member. I really recommend listening - such a refreshing, optimistic lens on human ingenuity, commitment and the final frontier.
On a related note, I do think this podcast has become must listen - and many clearly agree with me. It is now one of the most popular tech podcasts in the world (#2 on Spotify, for example).",MISC

"Excellent essay on the implications of generative AI for the big 5 tech companies. Like much of what is written elsewhere, I think the predictions for Google are too dire - I would be surprised if they don't integrate their industry leading AI models into the flagship search product for queries where that makes sense (note: not most commercial queries, which are the only ones with ads).
I think the unresolved economic challenges of serving the AI results (given huge compute costs) and the legal/economic rights issues on the training data will be challenging for all, especially large players like Google and Microsoft.
All that said, does feel like a really meaningful discontinuity for so many products and services, including search.",Data privacy and cybersecurity

"Useful caution on the likely pace of change triggered by AI. I thought the following observations were particularly spot on:
(1) when something gets more efficient/capable we often consume more of it because it opens new frontiers in what is possible - think of how many more financial analyst positions were created after the launch of Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel
(2) there is significant inertia in the complexity of providing complete solutions vs technology (which is rarely useful by itself)",MISC
The annual deck from Ben Evans - one of the best and most pithy tech observers.,MISC
"AI regulation is clearly coming. The EU already has multiple drafts in process. And it is one of very few topics Democrats and Republicans can agree upon. The challenge of course is that no one can clearly articulate what the regulations should achieve, let alone what rules could enable or prevent those outcomes.
In an effort to embrace the reality and try to shape the debate, OpenAI gave testimony in the Senate last week and just issued a blog post advocating for an international agency similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency. I am glad they and the tech industry more broadly are leaning in.
From a politics perspective, this was a smart move and made last week's hearing much friendlier than it could have been. From a policy perspective, it is hard to tell yet. The proposal acknowledges the global nature of the risks and the issues. Today's blog post provided more detail, including distinctions between smaller open source models and experiments vs large models. Given the pace of progress on open source, it is not clear how meaningful this distinction is or will remain. But OpenAI's proposal is certainly better than some more specific suggestions like assigning punitive liability to hosting companies or requiring regulatory review of every code release or individual attributes of models - or defaulting to forcing everything through a privacy regulatory lens, which while very important for social media may not be a top three regulatory issue for AI.
I personally think the most productive regulatory effort would actually be to clarify where and how existing laws apply. For example, what does copyright mean in the context of AI? Does Drake have rights to an AI model trained on his songs? What constitutes fair use? How about privacy and data security laws? Non-discrimination laws ? Product safety regulations and product liability rules? Reducing uncertainty in the application of existing laws and regulations could go a long way toward producing fair outcomes and retaining trust in the ability of political and legal systems to keep up with rapid technological change.",Regulation/Legislation

A decade ago, what commenced as an individual's vision has now evolved into a thriving reality. This milestone is not merely a celebration of the company's achievements but a testament to the collective efforts of our remarkable team and supporters.
Reflecting on the journey that has brought us to this significant juncture, our early days from 2013 to 2018 were laden with challenges, ranging from securing funding, building a reliable team, and designing the product from the ground up. All this while navigating a competitive market and culminating in an eventual asset sale. Despite the daunting obstacles, this period forged the resilience and innovative spirit that laid the foundation for version 2.0, initiated in 2020, defining the company as a fast-growing, innovative data science CRO.
As we expanded, so did our team and network of supportersâ€”organically and through acquisitions such as MetaVate and DCDS. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to every employee who joined us along the way. Your dedication, creativity, and hard work are the backbone of our success.
At the core of everything we do are our clients and customers. I am forever grateful to the early believersâ€”our initial customers and investors who saw potential in our vision and paved the way for our current successes. Every client we have supported has shaped our products and services through continuous feedback, loyalty, and engagement.
The journey ahead continues to be promising, and our commitment to innovation and excellence remains unwavering. I want to express my profound appreciation to everyone who has been part of our journey. Your support, in its many forms, has been the lifeblood of Algorics.

"Vectaraâ€™s hybrid search capabilities are now even strongerâ€”thanks to new metadata abilities ðŸ¦¾
Metadata is so critical for hashtag#hybridsearch for two reasons: ðŸ’» End user UX: Most neural retrieval models have difficulty handling metadata because theyâ€™re focused on vector embedding. However, applying metadata as filters makes it possible to narrow down information fed into LLMs and reduce hallucinations. ðŸ”’ Security: Metadata makes it possible to apply business roles on what can be retrieved (i.e., â€œconfidentialâ€) and which data within a retrieved set you want to give to an LLM.
Vectara recognized that mixing the types of operations you could do for search was important, which is why we released hybrid search in April 2023. Now, weâ€™re excited to bring hybrid search to the next stage: being able to update which fields are available for structured search and how theyâ€™re processed.

"quote in Bloomberg on the OpenAI and Sam Altman saga.
At the same time, companies that depend on OpenAIâ€™s software were hastily looking at competing technologies, such as Meta Plaforms Inc.â€™s large language model, known as Llama. â€œAs a startup, we are worried now. Do we continue with them or not?â€ said Amr Awadallah, the CEO of Vectara, which creates chatbots for corporate data.
He said that the choice to continue with OpenAI or seek out a competitor would depend on reassurances from the company and Microsoft. â€œWe need Microsoft to speak up and say everything is stable, weâ€™ll continue to focus on our customers and partners,â€ Awadallah said. â€œWe need to hear something like that to restore our confidence.â€",MISC

"Thank you to everyone who participated in our Fusion Fund 2023 Annual Meeting last week! It was a great pleasure to welcome the broader Fusion Fund community of LPs, founders, and ecosystem members to Silicon Valley, and hear from our special guest Eric S. Yuan (he / him / his), CEO of Zoom, our portfolio founders, and members of our Fusion CXO Network.
Reflecting on our fund's trajectory, I am proud of the growth and accomplishments we've achieved over the past years. It was a privilege to share these insights and to discuss the technological trends and opportunities that lie ahead for us in venture capital. Meanwhile, my Partner Trevor Mottl's analysis of the expanding influence of AI provided a comprehensive look at its role in shaping both public and private markets.
One of the eveningâ€™s highlights was the fireside chat with our guest speaker Eric S. Yuan (he / him / his). The conversation was super inspiring, offering us deep insights into the tech ecosystem's evolution and the future of AI, and reminding us of the entrepreneurial spirit that propels our industry forward.
The ambition and creativity of our portfolio founders shone through as they outlined the groundbreaking platforms they are building. Their presentations were a testament to the innovation that we are proud to support at Fusion Fund. A special thank you to Adam Abate of Mission Bio, Chetan Venkatesh of Macrometa, Lana Feng, Ph.D. of Huma.AI, Charlie Silver of Ruby Bio, Sabina Bruehlmann of Nimble Science, Jiantao Jiao of Nexusflow, and Amr Awadallah of Vectara!
Our panelists, including Fusion CXO member Mark Silis, CIO of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Venture Partner Rohini Kosoglu, Partner Shane Wall, and moderator Amit Srivastav, engaged in a riveting discussion on the interplay between AI, regulatory frameworks, and market dynamics. With the recent Executive Order on AI safety and security, we couldnâ€™t have wrapped up a more timely discussion!
Finally, and most importantly, our heartfelt appreciation goes out to our Limited Partners. Your unwavering support and commitment are the bedrock upon which our success is built. As we look to the future, we are grateful for your partnership and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.

"Last week we were privileged to host a dinner featuring a select group of startup leaders operating at the cutting edge of GenAI. While the conversation was lively and wide-ranging, we honed in on what some of the core implications for modern enterprises would be. Here were 3 key takeaways:
1) The path to widespread AI adoption in enterprises will likely take 2 to 5 years. Currently, there is a lot of enterprise experimentation with applications where hallucinations remain an issue. Additionally, there are challenges with scaling infrastructure to meet large-scale adoption. 2) We are still in the early days of figuring out what we can do with this technology similar to the early days of the Apple app store where the current set of GenAI applications are not necessarily revolutionary. The more interesting use cases are still to come. As a result, emerging players will have to help enterprises learn where and how to adopt these new applications, plus define their outcomes and return on investment. 3) For company builders, governance and safety need to be a bottom-up priority where you are able to respond to the evolving regulatory landscape. However, determining the appropriate regulations for GenAI is difficult because predicting the societal risks at the burgeoning stages of AI is akin to predicting the risks of social media at its onset in the early 2010s.",Data privacy and cybersecurity

Amr Awadallah discussing impact of Vectara hashtag#GenAI at TRANSFORM VC event tonight. It was great to catch up with Raed A. Masri and finally meet Rama Chakaki!,MISC
"Amr Awadallah great presentation and summarizing their solution
He made a great case on WHY hashtag#RAG will be the predominant solution versus fine tuning of hashtag#llm
Vectara Simplified differentiator for their RAG solution. *Data can be added/updated incrementally.
*Output driven by facts as defined in the data.
*Cited sources = transparency, explainabilit!
*Generation only pays attention to retrieved facts: not copyrighted data or bias in training.
*Permission ACLs are enforced on output.
*Easy to maintain and stay current with state of the art foundational models.
*Vectara does not retain the query or the output, and we don't train on your data either. (Zero shot retrieval)
Further explanation of fine tuning versus RAG in links below.",MISC
"Generative AI is quickly emerging as the game to watch. While Microsoft, with the help of OpenAI, held a strong position, behemoths like Google and Amazon are upping the ante with their own efforts and recent bets on Anthropic. Entry to this high-limit table now seems reserved for those with trillion-dollar chips.
Yet venture capital hasnâ€™t shied away from backing hashtag#GenAI startups. So whoâ€™s bluffing? Is there still a window for startups to outwit their more deep-pocketed rivals, especially with regulators looking to balance the odds?
I firmly believe itâ€™s still anyone's game, especially considering the uncertainty around hallucination risks, solving real business problems, and establishing trust in these solutions. There will be strategic opportunities available to startups that can maneuver around industry giants, who will increasingly focus on the biggest pot: global AGI dominance. Eager to hear from others! How do you think the GenAI ecosystem will evolve?",MISC

"Fascinating read in the The New York Times on the challenges AI start-ups face in a world where 'hyperscalers' like Google, Microsoft and Amazon control the computing power necessary to develop groundbreaking tech. #AI #StartUps
AI start-ups today need substantial resources to succeed. Companies like Cohere are turning back to their roots at tech giants, buying the necessary computing power to create their own technology. Itâ€™s like the plot of Game of Thrones, according to David Katz from Radical Ventures, with the tech giants deciding who gets the computing power and who doesn't. #Innovation #TechGiants
In an interesting twist, it's open source software that may even the playing field. The recent decision by Meta to open source its large language model is a game changer, enabling anyone to build on it and compete. In the words of Amr Awadallah, â€œHaving the collective minds of every researcher on Earth would beat any company.â€ #OpenSource #FutureOfAI
While Australiaâ€™s defense innovation ecosystem is burgeoning, itâ€™s crucial to consider these international dynamics:
- How can we foster an environment that promotes not just local start-ups, but also the development of advanced tech like AI?
- How can we ensure access to the necessary resources, like computing power, isn't a roadblock for Australian innovators?
- How can we leverage open-source tech to our advantage?

Aside from the short-term stir, this move by Red Hat to limit the distribution of their upstream open source base will not affect Rocky Linux users at all. It does, however, make the job of our volunteer community a bit harder, but we have already figured out several workarounds to assure that we will continue supporting all Rocky users as before, keeping open source open.

I was moved to tears by seeing them again after such a long time. They are brilliant minds who are tackling some of the toughest scientific and engineering problems for hashtag#nasa, yet they are modest and genuinely happy to see me. I feel blessed! I want to thank Analytical Mechanics Associates for creating a wonderful culture where people are valued and respected. It was fun to hang out with our CEO, John Abrams, the company owners, and everyone else at the event. We also had a casino night that was a blast, especially since we were playing with fake money!

"With hashtag#COP28 underway, I wanted to share some insights from a conversation I recently had with Christiana Figueres for my latest podcast episode. Christiana is the former Executive Secretary of the UN Framework on Climate Change. In this episode, she talks about how embracing an optimistic mindset helped her lead the process that secured the Paris Agreement, and how she now applies this way of thinking to our current challenge: that we need to execute climate solutions much faster and at greater scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. â€œOptimism,â€ she said, â€œis not the output. Itâ€™s the input. Itâ€™s the mindset. It is the focus of our attention and our conviction that we actually have everything that it takes to solve a problem.â€
One reality is that we are behind. The other reality is that, with technology, we are â€œway forward, way faster, than we ever thought possible.â€ I agree with Christiana that now is the moment to set these two realities side by side â€“ â€œto see them in equal importanceâ€ â€“ and get to work. Yes, we are behind. But we can still catch up and build a sustainable net-zero future. And Iâ€™m proud that, at COP 28, Siemens is in the Green Zone showcasing technology to make this possible.
After all, as Christiana said, if energy is driving 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy can also be 75 percent of the solution. hashtag#OptimisticOutlook",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"This is a critical moment in the effort to build a sustainable future, as many wonder if climate objectives such as the Paris Agreement can still be realized.
The opportunity is clear: technology has advanced far more rapidly than climate experts anticipated. But hereâ€™s the challenge: achieving climate goals now requires us to apply these technologies much faster.
Siemens has accepted this challenge, and I had a chance to share our plan of action at last weekâ€™s CECP CEO Investor Forum focused on climate change. I shared how the intention of our strong sustainability governance and ESG framework, DEGREE, is to increase the speed for achieving our own hashtag#NetZero commitments and helping customers to achieve theirs.
This was on the heels of Siemens reporting record earnings as we continue to accelerate our customersâ€™ digital and hashtag#sustainability transformations. Today, more than 90 percent of our global revenue comes from a portfolio that enables sustainability impact.
Customers deploying our technologies are able to reduce energy consumption; theyâ€™re able to use fewer resources; theyâ€™re able to advance decarbonization. Butâ€™s it not just about using less; itâ€™s also about doing more.
The technologies advancing decarbonization also bolster productivity. They generate strong business results and improve operational performance. And our strategy to help customers combine the real and digital worlds now offers a path forward for increasing speed and scale. The more we work on real-world processes and things in the digital world, the sooner we will build a sustainable future.
The question I closed with is: What is the cost of doing nothing? As business leaders, we have to look at our business cases in a new light. We must realize there are very rational judgments to be made when it comes to decarbonization. These rational judgements will lead us to the right kind of action within our organizations.
But if we do not drive change fast enough, what are the future impacts to our businesses and to society? Acting now with what we have is better than waiting for a perfect solution that may or may not arrive in the future. And at Siemens, we see that this commitment to hashtag#decarbonization â€“ to accelerating action â€“ is not only a vital responsibility; itâ€™s really the basis for our future business growth. hashtag#CEOInvestorForum",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"For decades, we saw American manufacturing get redistributed to other countries. But this is a new era.
Our $150 million investment in a new high-tech plant in Texas â€“ announced today with Roland Busch â€“ shows how American manufacturing is growing again in the United States.
Think about what weâ€™ve experienced in just the past few years. Weâ€™ve seen disruption in global supply chains reinforce the need to not be overly reliant on one region for sourcing critical items. Supply chain challenges have been a factor in evolving globalization into â€œglocalization.â€ Itâ€™s a world that's ever more global, ever more connected, but where we're capable of manufacturing things closer to the point of demand.
Siemensâ€™ growth in the United States over the past year â€“ investing $500 million in our U.S. #manufacturing footprintâ€“ reflects this. And thereâ€™s a lot more driving this than supply chain trends.
First, thereâ€™s the impact of digital technologies. In the last decade, we saw digital technologies transform our personal lives and the consumer world. Now theyâ€™re coming to industry and #infrastructure. We see the rise of AI and 5G and cloud in consumer spaces â€“ but also igniting transformation and growth in critical infrastructure markets. What weâ€™ve thought of as more traditional industries are joining forces with the tech sector. With this growth comes new high-tech factories that create jobs and strengthen local economies.
Second, weâ€™re seeing all of this accelerated by government investment in infrastructure, manufacturing and climate. Government investment is sending a strong signal to the private sector. And Siemens is among the companies investing.
This is an exciting day for Siemens and for the resurgence of American industry.",Supply chain

"What a great week having our global leader Roland Busch with us in the U.S. for meetings, an #OptimisticOutlook podcast recording (more on that to come), and a very big announcement: our $220 million investment in a new rail manufacturing hub in Lexington, N.C.
Iâ€™ll share just one quick takeawayâ€”that in the announcement we saw a core theme in our meetings become a reality: our world is becoming more â€œglocal.â€ Like the internet fueled globalization, shifting many American manufacturing to other countries, technologies now coming of age and supply chain realities will be every bit as influential in *localizing* production here in the U.S.
Now, as Roland said, this doesnâ€™t mean decoupling â€“ taking production from one area and moving it elsewhere. Rather, it means that, as the transformation of industry and infrastructure accelerates â€“ and as global events spotlight the need for supply chain resilience â€“ global production networks are now diversifying. Companies are growing their overall manufacturing capabilities and, as glocalization takes hold, choosing to do this closer to the point of the demand.
Which is exactly what we see in Lexington! Siemens is meeting growing U.S. demand for rail by tapping into rail innovation that's been tested and continually refined across our global team, then bringing production close to our East Coast customers. This provides Siemens with a bicoastal #manufacturing presence!
This is only the start of glocalization and the benefits weâ€™ll see to jobs, our economy, and to sustainability. And Iâ€™m so proud to be part of #TeamSiemens in this moment where we can make such a significant impact.

"One of my familyâ€™s favorite holiday traditions is attending the Sanford Childrenâ€™s Hospitalâ€™s annual Christmas at the Castle in Sioux Falls! This event celebrates the children and families spending time at the Castle of Care and provides them with holiday cheer during a difficult time. It is also an opportunity to recognize our amazing caregivers for all they do to make the holidays special for our patients. Each year at Christmas at the Castle, I am reminded of the miracles that our team creates every day for the youngest, most vulnerable patients for whom we have the privilege of caring. This yearâ€™s program featured one of those miracles: 12-year-old Channing Heck, the official switch master in charge of lighting up the Christmas tree. Just last year, Channing was watching the Christmas tree lighting from his window at the Castle where he was being treated for a viral infection in his lungs that was exacerbated due to his asthma. After being admitted to the hospital and ultimately being placed on ECMO to give his lungs time to rest, he recovered and is now doing well. It was an honor to meet him, his parents and his two younger brothers at the event and watch him flip the switch to light up this yearâ€™s Christmas tree. We wish Channing and all the courageous kids at the Castle a very merry Christmas!

"This Veterans Day, we honor and celebrate the members of our Sanford family who have served or are currently serving in the armed forces, as well as those we care for at Sanford Health and the Good Samaritan Society. Health care organizations like ours have a unique privilege of showing our commitment and gratitude to veterans, military members and their families through the care we deliver every day. As part of our commitment, we are always striving to better understand veteransâ€™ specific health care needs to ensure they receive high-quality, inclusive care. At Sanford, we are doing this by offering trainings for staff, partnering with the VA and providing resources like Veterans Clubs and the Veteran Ambassador Program that help veteran patients feel more at home during a stay at Sanford Health. For our veteran employees, we are investing in programs and benefits that ensure they have a meaningful opportunity to continue their service to others as they transition into the civilian workforce.
Personally, Veterans Day is a special day for my family. My father, Matt, dedicated 23 years to our country as a member of the United States Air Force, and afterward continued his service to others by establishing Feeding South Dakota, the stateâ€™s largest hunger relief organization. The ways in which he exemplifies commitment, leadership, resilience and integrity have guided me my whole life, and I am fortunate to continue learning from him every day. My wife, Jill, has dedicated her career to caring for veterans through her work as a physician assistant at the Sioux Falls VA Health Care System. While Jill and I did not have the honor of serving in the armed forces, we consider it our duty to give back to those who have given so much to our country.
On this Veterans Dayâ€”and every dayâ€”I extend my deepest gratitude to our veterans at Sanford Health and throughout our communities. Thank you for your service.

+ Our consumption business has been growing above market rates and more than 30% yoy excluding the effects of the migration and more than 50% including migrations. Consumption now accounts for more than 80% of our nearly $1B in revenue.
+ We have more engaged customers than any other Observability platform, and weâ€™ve been adding new paid customers to our consumption business at market leading rates thanks to our highly efficient product-led GTM motion. In the last three years, nearly half of our customers are brand new to New Relic, and more deeply engaged in our platform!
+ Given our unique â€œall-in-oneâ€ platform model, more customers use multiple products (we call them capabilities since they do not have distinct package or price) than leading competitorsâ€¦that translates to deeper customer engagement and more value on New Relic!
+ Our innovation engine has been accelerating in last few years and delivering first to market generative AI capabilities in just the last few months.

"KPMG just released our latest edition of #CEOoutlook, and it was great to speak to Forbes about this year's findings. I encourage you to take a look as I was struck by how the stats tell one of the clearest stories yet.
Weâ€™ve been running this research for 9 years, where we speak to thousands of leaders across a vast array of territories and industry groups. Results typically vary from one region to the next, but this year, there was greater consistency across regions and sectors.
From a shifting geopolitical landscape to AI and ESG â€“ executives are juggling with a raft of new opportunities and threats â€“ on top of the day-to-day challenge of balancing the books during a period of economic unease. But despite it all, confidence in the wider economy is broadly positive â€“ echoing my own view that better market conditions are on the horizon even as we face numerous obstacles.
The key to success will be a relentless focus on long-term, strategic planning that avoids the danger of reactive decisions limited by a narrow short-term horizon. Thatâ€™s certainly been the case at KPMG as weâ€™ve regularly had to update our strategy and reaffirm our commitment to it.
2020, 2021, 2022, 2023â€¦ Each year unpredictable, each year creating a new norm. Itâ€™s impossible to believe that any five-year plan has been left untouched. Yet businesses are moving forward, learning new ways to build resilience, and focusing on the bigger picture.
Iâ€™ll leave you with my favorite statistic in this report: 69% of CEOs have now fully embedded ESG into their businesses as a means to value creation. Itâ€™s a very encouraging finding and if the KPMG 2023 CEO Outlook tells us anything, itâ€™s that leaders are prepared and ready to do what it takes to build a more sustainable world that benefits every one of us.",Economic Outlook

"I joined the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) Monday morning for a discussion on global competitiveness and innovation at the 21st International Advisory Council Meeting. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong led a great session, and the conversation reinforced a notion Iâ€™ve written a lot about: The need for strong global linkages in a world thatâ€™s dividing.

"Saturday is Veterans Day in the US. Itâ€™s a day that always meant something in my house. My dad served in Vietnam, and both my granddads served in World War II. They used to talk about how the skills they learned in the service set them up for success later in life. Service members are resilient. They know how to operate under pressure. They have skills in science and technology. They understand what it takes to work as part of a teamâ€”and what it takes to lead. These are highly valuable capabilities, especially in US industries experiencing labor shortages, such as infrastructure and manufacturing.
We just published a new report that puts a number on that value: $15 billion. Thatâ€™s how much could be added to the US economy over a decade by unleashing the value of veteransâ€™ work experience through skills-based hiring. You can read the report here: https://lnkd.in/guCm8duR
We practice this at McKinsey. We hire peopleâ€”not degrees. We have doubled our veteran hires over the last three years, and weâ€™re not done yet. Weâ€™ve also more than tripled our talent recruitment sources, from 540 in 2021 to more than 1,700 this past year, to ensure that everyone with the right skills and talent has a shot at our firm. Building a talent model around skills is good for business and good for society. It boosts the number and quality of applicants who apply to open positions. It gives more people a chance at creating a better life. And it provides a crucial jolt to communities and economies.

"A sustainable future for our planet. Itâ€™s going to take a lot to get there, including innovative solutions to twin technological challenges: reducing and avoiding carbon emissions, and permanently removing gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Frontierâ€”which we helped found along with Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripeâ€”is a $1 billion advance market commitment to purchase permanent carbon removal by 2030.

"When I think about what 2023 may hold, I'm struck by how much has changed since this time last year.
Geopolitical tensions have boiled over into Russia's senseless war against Ukraine, while US-China relations have grown increasingly tense. Inflation triggered energy and food security issues, and volatility in global markets. Supply chain issues linger, and now the world watches with a mix of relief and concern as China pivots off its zero-COVID strategy.
Against this background, I won't make predictions for the year ahead except to say that it is likely to be turbulent. Here some thoughts on the kind of leadership that may be required.
1. Balance defensive and offensive priorities. Yes, this is a moment to prioritize efficient and effective use of resources. But it is also a time to look for long-term potential. Make bold moves; build new businesses; use new and better technology to differentiate from competitors; stay the course on the transition to net zero; rethink the future of the workplace for a hybrid world.
Our data shows that leaders who play both offense and defense in troubled times outperform all rivals. (https://lnkd.in/gZYFG3cd)
2. Reimagine globalization. The world's toughest challenges - climate, health, security, innovation â€“ wonâ€™t be solved by countries or even regions in isolation. We are far more interconnected than most people realize, and dismantling globalization would be far more costly than most have imagined. (https://lnkd.in/gDhu6rVG)
Our opportunity is to recognize the faults of globalization as it exists today while finding new avenues to come together across trade, standards, talent, and capital flows. By doing so we can improve access for all, especially the most vulnerable. For business leaders the immediate opportunity is to reimagine the global footprint of their organizations, as opposed to shrinking back to home markets.
3. Lean into the 'and' in sustainable and inclusive growth. I believe sustainability, inclusion, and growth can, and must, reinforce each other - creating a virtuous cycle in which growth provides the resources needed to contain climate change, promote natural capital and biodiversity, empower households, and promote equitable opportunity. (https://lnkd.in/gB_Tuy_D)
Driving sustainable and inclusive growth is far from easy. There are real tensions that need to be addressed. For business leaders the challenge is to take a long-term view on capital, invest in upskilling at scale AND meet climate goals as the energy transition continues. This demands courage, collaboration, and speed.

"Today is Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans. Itâ€™s a day to recognize the progress we have made against racismâ€”and reaffirm our duty to end it.

"This week I returned to Norway for Arendalsuka, or Arendal Week, the annual gathering in Norway dedicated to political empowerment, democracy, and openness.
This was my second time at the event, and I left feeling even more inspired than last year. Why? In three words: resilience, collaboration, and courage.
Geopolitics, climate change, shifting demographics, tech innovation. Navigating any one of these would be enough to define a career. Leaders today face all four at once.
The leaders I spoke with in Norway are focused on building their resilience muscles to meet this moment. They are finding ways to not only recoverâ€”but recover stronger and thrive as disruptions continue. And they are finding the best solutions in the world for problems that donâ€™t respect borders.
What does this take? One thing is agility, the ability to act and react quickly without stumbling. Another is balance, the notion that youâ€™re managing for near-term performance without losing sight of long-term potential.
Lastly, it takes real courage. The courage to be decisive and move fast amid persistent headwinds. Leaders in Arendal exemplified these qualities. I aspire to do the same. You can learn more about building a resilience agenda here: https://lnkd.in/gnnsaE2P

"The future of work in Americaâ€”the mass occupational shift in the labor market weâ€™ve been anticipatingâ€”is no longer years or even months away. Itâ€™s happening right now.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues reveal its potential to accelerate inclusive economic growth in their latest report. My top takeaway: The US economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs.
You can read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eBrcCbip
Some context: Between 2019 and 2022, the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts as people left jobs during the pandemic in areas like food services, in-person sales, and office support.
Today, generative AI is accelerating the scope and speed of automation. Activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours worked across the US economy could be automated by 2030. Jobs in food service, in-person sales, and office support could continue to decline.
But there is potential upside here.
We think generative AI could enhance the way people work in STEM, creative, and business/legal professions rather than eliminating jobs in those fields outright.
Federal investment addressing climate change will produce a net employment gain in green industries. Infrastructure projects will further increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today.
Finally, as the population ages, we see increased demand for healthcare workers, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce. What will it take to get this shift right? The report finds that part of the answer has to do with workforce development and upskilling on a massive scale. Another involves hiring approaches that focus on skills rather than credentials.
None of that will be easy. Accelerating inclusive growth requires courage among leaders and collaboration across industries and sectors. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say: Iâ€™m so inspired to get to work.

"The world needs Africa to thrive. Home to the youngest and fastest-growing population on Earth, the continent will play a critical role in our ability to make the transition to net zero and lessen the emerging impact of demographic decline.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have just published a new report on Africa. They describe it as a â€œclarion call for sustainable, inclusive growth.â€ It takes a granular look at Africaâ€™s economic performance, highlighting successes across its countries, cities, and companies.
You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/gmBdRT7K
The report finds that Africaâ€™s growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But thereâ€™s no â€˜one Africa.â€™ Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from whatâ€™s working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sectorâ€”even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010â€”it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets wonâ€™t be easy, especially amid todayâ€™s headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continentâ€”and the global economyâ€”thrive.

"A year ago, we set up a group dedicated to helping our clients navigate geopolitical risks. In addition to war in Europe and unfolding competition among states in Asia, business leaders need to monitor a host of long-tail political risks and conflicts across other geographies, including Africa and South Asia.
Even so, I worry that not enough structured, forward-looking conversations about geopolitics are happening among senior management teams and at board level. These conversations are needed to develop â€˜strategic foresightâ€™ â€“ the ability to see around corners and position a company to weather storms and move fast on opportunities.
Working with client's weâ€™ve found that scenario planning can be an effective tool for structuring this dialog. Done well, scenario planning builds insight and senior-team alignment on the outcomes that would have the most material effect on an organization. This in turn enables a move from scanning to planning â€“ creating early-warning systems and active contingency plans covering everything from data and networks to people and partnerships to repatriation of funds and security.

"#sustainability and ESG are as important as any Financial KPI's for a company to be successful in today's modern world-- I want to congratulate the entire #genesys team for the amazing success we have achieved since the launch of these formal efforts a few years ago.
Kudos and a big thank you to Bridgette McAdoo for your strong leadership!!!
Please feel free to read this years' report (link below); some notable highlights are as follows:
1. Improving from a Bronze to a Gold rating by EcoVadis in less than two years â€” this places Genesys in the top 5% of the more 100,000 companies assessed by the organization, and in the top 1% of those in the software provider industry.
2. Achieving LEED Platinum certifications for its new offices in Galway, Ireland; and Menlo Park, California. The establishment of LEED-certified buildings is a vital piece in addressing climate change, meeting Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals, enhancing resilience and support for our communities.
3. Genesys reports not only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also Scope 3 and has organically reduced its overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8% in the last year and nearly 25% over the last 2 years. This reduction was driven primarily by helping our customers on their Sustainability journeys by transitioning them from on-premise software solutions to the cloud. We have committed to setting science-based targets (SBTi) and becoming carbon neutral by 2030
4. We have committed to positively impact over 100 million experiences annually by supporting nonprofit charitable organizations by 2030. Last year we achieved over 46 million and and look forward to further supporting those in need for years into the future.
5. Genesys has committed to improve our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) to align with the communities in which we work. During the last year (1) underrepresented leadership (director and above) in the U.S. grew from 20.4% to 22.5%, (2) representation across all underrepresented groups in the U.S. workforce grew by greater than 13%, and (3) since officially establishing the DEI program in 2020, women in leadership across the globe increased by more than 20%.",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

â–¶ Regarding business-to-government data sharing, the text is far too open, leading to potential misuse and risking data breaches.

"Since I first started working in the pharma industry, Iâ€™ve witnessed positive change toward creating more equitable opportunities for women in the workforce. And while I remain optimistic for the future, I recognize that we still have a long way to go to change the gender parity for female leaders. We all know unconscious biases still exist in the workplace today. But many focus more on the glass ceiling aspect of female leadership and less on what happens when women rise to the top of leadership ranks. A recent study from Women of Influence+ examined thousands of working women from 100+ countries to determine how their mental health, well-being, engagement and performance were affected by interactions with their colleagues surrounding their success and accomplishments. Almost 90 percent of women worldwide reported being penalized or undermined because of their achievements at work. We must do better.

"Today marks the end of #CybersecurityAwarenessMonth here at Cisco and across the industry.
One of the most pressing issues we face when it comes to cybersecurity is the skills gap. Nearly 3.4 million cybersecurity jobs will go unfilled by 2025, and just 15% of companies globally feel their infrastructure is mature enough for todayâ€™s cybersecurity demands.
Itâ€™s more important than ever to bridge this gap by expanding the talent pool and reducing industry burnout. I'm incredibly proud of the work our Cisco teams are doing to address the skills gap in the industry through Cisco Networking Academy. In fact, this month we introduced an Ethical Hacker course along with new multi-cloud certifications that are focused on networking & securityâ€¦ we're excited about the impact these programs can have.
Cybersecurity Awareness is important year-round, not just during this one month. I believe together, we can create a ripple effect of cyber awareness and action at a time when security is more critical than ever.",Data privacy and cybersecurity

"Out today, Ciscoâ€™s #Cybersecurity Readiness Index highlights that only 15% of organizations have a cybersecurity posture thatâ€™s mature enough to defend against the threats of a hybrid world. We measured the cybersecurity readiness of companies across five key pillars - identity, devices, network, application workloads, and data - and the results were clear: no matter what kind of business you operate and no matter where you are in the world, security resilience is imperative in todayâ€™s world.
At first this may sound frightening, and itâ€™s true that weâ€™re facing a threat landscape thatâ€™s more expansive than weâ€™ve ever seen, with attack methods changing at a rapid pace and bad actors getting more sophisticated. In fact, 82% of leaders expect a cybersecurity incident to disrupt their business within the next two years. Weâ€™ve been living and working in new ways for over three years, and we know people, devices, workloads, and applications will continue to be more and more distributed moving forward. Organizations are accelerating their multi-cloud adoption more quickly than many expected. In this dynamic environment, a number of my peers have expressed that they donâ€™t worry about if a breach will happen, but when.
But despite so much uncertainty, I remain optimistic. I believe the data highlights the opportunities that exist for the public and private sectors to work together to close the readiness gap. With tighter alignment and partnership, we can truly reap all the benefits of our connected world, without fear of disruption. We all depend on a secure world, and if we share threat intelligence, cooperate on legislation to keep everyone safe, and rally around the idea that security and privacy are human rights, we can realize a truly secure and inclusive future for all.
As the builders of the internet, security remains critical for Ciscoâ€™s business and our ability to support our customersâ€™ resilience. Our team is dedicated to building the simple, intelligent, interoperable, and platform-driven solutions our customers demand today and will need tomorrow. Youâ€™ll be hearing more from us in the weeks and months to come, and Iâ€™m so excited about whatâ€™s ahead for Cisco and security.

Security is a top priority for Cisco and our global customers, and we introduced new risk-based capabilities across our security portfolio to protect multi-cloud environments. We believe Risk-Based Authentication and our industry-first Business Risk Observability Platform will both be game-changers for our customers.
We also know that customers are extending their networks to new places, while looking to simplify their IT operations. We announced new cloud management tools for industrial #IoT applications, a simplified dashboard to converge IT and OT operations, and flexible network intelligence across all industrial assets, all aimed at keeping our customers as agile as possible.
Iâ€™ve talked many times about our commitment to building sustainability into our technology products to help our customers achieve their own goals. Soon, Carbon Emissions Insights in Webex Control Hub will provide collaboration customers with Scope 2 emissions data and recommendations for optimizing energy consumption.
Finally, we continue to be focused on promoting digital skills through our Networking Academy program. This week, we shared our goal to train 10M people across EMEA in digital and cybersecurity skills over the next 10 years, as part of our plan to train 25M people worldwide in the same timeframe.

"A leadership lesson from dad...
He would say, ""don't worry about being better than someone else, but never stop trying to be the best you can be.""
We are an uber competitive family and we all learned at an early age, success doesn't always equal the highest score at the end of the game. Don't confuse that with everyone gets a ribbon/trophy because that drives us bonkers. There is only one first place!
But, when we seek success, it is not against someone else's best, it is always against our own.
Success is something you control. No one can give it to you, and no one can take it away either. ""Success is peace of mind that is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming."" John Wooden
As a leader, it is important to seek the best in each team member and to realize, it will look different in each of us. It can also look different day to day or year to year.
Think of the last time you were sick; or had an injury; or didn't get enough sleep; or were grieving the loss of a loved one; or were lost, sad or overwhelmed. Did your typical ""best"" aka success, look different then? It likely did.
It is easy to make comparisons, but it is a dangerous trap to fall into as a leader. Sally's best is never going to be Timmy's and Timmy's best will never be Sally's. They have unique ""bests"".
As a leader, focus on the differences you may see in each individual's best. That is when you are truly listening, knowing, seeing and growing/developing the individual talent around you.
My dad has shot skeet and hunted his whole life. We ate all sorts of stuff growing up. ""Chicken"" had lots of different looks on the table if you know what I mean. Which is probably why I don't eat chicken today. He's 76 now and still out there doing what he loves. This picture was taken two weeks ago. As we were talking about the hunt, he lamented the days where he would have gotten, shot, 15 out of 15 instead of ""only"" 9 out of 15 of the pheasants that day. (As an aside, the pheasants will be eaten, none at my house, but all the same they will be eaten. We don't shoot for just sport; it is food for many).
I could see and hear his disappointment in himself. That is when his lesson immediately came to me, and I shared it back to him. ""Don't worry about being better than someone else, even your younger self, but never stop trying to be the best you can be."" We smiled as he realized that 9 out of 15 was his best that day...as he carries a heavy heart from losing our mom, his wife, of 55 years, as he is now 76 with A-Fib and Neuropathy. His best is 9 and it is good enough. We are enough when we can hold a mirror up and know we gave it our best.
He'll always be my hero and as a leader in our family, he understands the importance of his example, it is what we see, and it shapes who and how we are in life.
Be the leader, you want your team to become!

"3 ways to bounce back quicker from a sports injury...
As an athlete or someone who has an active lifestyle, having an injury is a shock to the system. In an instant, our routines change against our will, and we begin to grieve the loss of our mobility.
Mindset is important for recovery. It is super easy to over reflect and fill ourselves with anxious thoughts; ""why did this happen? why now? why did I lift it that way? is it all downhill from here?"" These are normal thoughts, but they can increase the amount of cortisol in your bloodstream which will increase inflammation and only increase your recovery time.
Knowing all of this didn't change the many negative and anxious thoughts I had this past Friday when I injured myself. My ranting reflections were much harsher than those above. As a cyclist, I am always in training. Race and ride season is around the corner. I am riding an average of 130 miles a week right now. ""I don't have time for a bleeping injury"", this was my main bubble thought.
1st- Acknowledge your feelings!
I allowed myself 20 minutes (my husband was so appreciative of the time limit) to acknowledge my feelings...rant, rant, rant and then I let the negative emotions go and set my focus to what I control.
2nd- Create a different narrative!
Start with positive affirmation for yourself. I refer to this as, ""my lucky girl"" mantra. I celebrate the little things. ""The water was warm in the shower today, what a lucky girl. My hair is so silky smooth today, what a lucky girl. I slept soundly last night, what a lucky girl... Then tell yourself a different story. I told myself that I will recover, and I will get stronger, and I will ride during this race season. Mindset is everything!
3d- Do something you can or something new!
Find ways to occupy your new-found time. I can plank as long as I lead with the left leg going out before the right leg; 32 minutes of 3 minutes on and 1 minute off was a good distraction and alternative for my brain today. I just finished reading, Smarter, Faster, Better, by Charles Duhigg and will cap the weekend off with reading, The Ride of a Lifetime, by Robert Iger.
I can't yet manage getting on my bike, but I managed to put a backpack on and walk 5 miles with Ben and Cooper today. Grateful for this movement. Phew, my daughter and I leave for a week of hiking in VA and NC next week. We'll have to shift our mindset from full day hikes, Little Devils Stairs Loop and Nicholson Hollow, and focus instead on half day or shorter hikes like, Hightop Summit and Old Rag Tag Mountain. Can't wait!
Bounce back quicker by,
Acknowledging your feelings
Creating a new narrative
Trying something new
Also, lean on friends and family for support and fun times while you recover, rest, and keep moving with whatever movement you have that doesn't result in more pain.

"Starting a new job can be tiring, here are a few reasons why and ways to help you stay energized and balanced.
ðŸ”¹Change in routine requires you to adjust to a new commute, work hours and norms which disrupt your usual schedule and can lead to fatigue.
ðŸ”¹Learning curve can be mentally exhausting as your brain adapts to a new environment, systems, processes, procedures etc.
ðŸ”¹Social interactions can be emotionally draining.
ðŸ”¹Performance pressure can lead to stress and/or anxiety as you look to make a good impression and perform well in your new role.
To stay energized and balanced during this transition, you can;
ðŸ”¸Take it slow. Focus on learning and listening. Pace yourself and allow for brain process time to appropriately prioritize actions.
ðŸ”¸Get adequate rest (like Cooper is doing in the pic).
ðŸ”¸Stay organized. I use my notes app, task lists and voice recorder to stay on top of things.
ðŸ”¸Ask for help. Seek guidance often. Inquiry is key when starting a new job.
ðŸ”¸Set realistic expectations. Itâ€™s normal to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself time to adapt.
ðŸ”¸Maintain self-care, personal equilibrium and balance. Continue to engage in hobbies, activities outside of work, exercise regularly, eat nutritious meals, get a good nights rest and maintain other healthy habits to recharge.
ðŸ”¸Network & socialize. Building relationships at work is important for impact, influence, successes and happiness.
ðŸ”¸Seek feedback. Initiate regular check-ins with your boss and others.
ðŸ”¶ðŸ”¶SET boundaries. Be clear about your availability and workload parameters.
ðŸ”¶ðŸ”¶Continuously learn. See each challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow.
ðŸ’¡Remember, itâ€™s normal to feel tired and overwhelmed when starting a new job. In time, you will become more familiar with your role, the teams you are working with, workplace norms & behaviors and before you know it, your tiredness will start to give way to new knowledge and understanding and therefore energy and optimism.",MISC

Today, I informed the Board of Directors of my choice to step away from this job at the end of 2024 â€“ providing a full year for the board to find the right leader to take our growing and diversified company forward into the future.
In reflecting on my work serving as President and CEO, Iâ€™m proud of our work to transform the company into a nonprofit mutual more than 10 years ago. Since then, we have grown into other lines of insurance and specialty benefits business through subsidiary companies. We have expanded our footprint to serve people around the nation in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, workers' compensation, long-term care insurance and specialty benefits. We own technology companies that help providers and plans to deliver care better. This hard work helped to more than double our enterprise revenue â€“ while keeping our overall profits within a range of 1 percent. That successful strategy allows health insurance to be more affordable than otherwise.
As I consider our many achievements, I have deep gratitude for the people who truly made the difference â€“ our thousands of employees. Their dedication and commitment to our members, customers, provider partners and the people of Michigan is unparalleled. It is evident in our diversity, our energy, our commitment to the mission and values of our company.
It has been my lifeâ€™s honor to serve in this role. I look forward to continuing to lead this great company throughout 2024.

"While leadership has always played a crucial role in the workplace, its importance has expanded beyond organizational boundaries to influence the world at large. In this post, we'll explore why leadership skills are more essential than ever in both the workplace and the broader global context.
ðŸ‘‰ Navigating Complexity and Uncertainty:
The world today is characterized by complexity and uncertainty. Whether it's technological disruptions, global pandemics, environmental crises, or geopolitical tensions, leaders must navigate uncharted waters. Effective leaders possess the ability to analyze complex situations, make informed decisions, and adapt to ever-changing circumstances.
ðŸ‘‰ Fostering Innovation:
Innovation is the lifeblood of progress, and leaders are catalysts for innovation. They create environments that encourage creativity, collaboration, and risk-taking. In the workplace, innovative leaders empower their teams to develop groundbreaking solutions to address evolving challenges.
ðŸ‘‰ Building Resilient Teams:
Resilience is key in the face of adversity, and leaders are instrumental in fostering it. A strong leader inspires confidence, instills a sense of purpose, and provides support during tough times. They help teams bounce back from setbacks and thrive in challenging environments.
ðŸ‘‰ Promoting Inclusivity and Diversity:
Diversity and inclusivity are no longer optional; they're imperatives. Leaders who champion diversity and inclusion create organizations that reflect the richness of society. In a globalized world, this not only drives creativity and innovation but also fosters empathy and understanding across cultures.
ðŸ‘‰ Addressing Ethical Dilemmas:
Leaders are often confronted with ethical dilemmas that impact not only their organizations but society as a whole. The ability to make principled decisions and uphold ethical standards is crucial for maintaining trust and integrity in leadership, both in the workplace and beyond.
ðŸ‘‰ Global Challenges Require Global Leadership:
Global challenges like climate change, economic inequality, and public health crises transcend borders. Effective leaders on the world stage can bring nations together to tackle these issues collaboratively. Leadership skills are vital for addressing these complex, interconnected problems.
ðŸ‘‰ Shaping the Future:
Leaders are architects of the future. Their vision, determination, and ability to inspire others shape the direction of organizations, communities, and nations. Leadership skills are essential for steering society toward a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future.
ðŸ‘‰ Nurturing Leadership at All Levels:
Leadership isn't limited to those in formal positions of authority. In today's world, leadership can and should emerge at all levels of an organization or community. Developing leadership skills among individuals throughout society is a means to address challenges collectively.",MISC
"Embrace the Gift of Growth: Why the Holiday Season is the Perfect Time to Invest in a Leadership Coach
While the holiday season is traditionally associated with festivities and relaxation, it's also an opportune time to invest in personal and professional development. One invaluable investment that can yield lasting benefits for both you and your business is hiring a leadership coach.
Here are a few compelling reasons why the holiday season is the best time to embark on this transformative journey:
1. Reflect and Reframe:
The year is drawing to a close, and what better time to reflect on your leadership journey? A leadership coach can help you analyze the highs and lows, providing valuable insights into your leadership style and areas for improvement. The holiday season's reflective atmosphere is ideal for setting the stage for personal and professional growth in the coming year.
2. Strategic Goal Setting:
As you prepare for the New Year, setting strategic goals is paramount. A leadership coach can work with you to establish clear, achievable objectives for yourself and your business. They can assist in creating a roadmap that aligns with your vision, fostering a sense of direction and purpose that will drive success in the upcoming year.
3. Stress Management:
The holidays, while joyous, can also be stressful. A leadership coach can provide tools and techniques to manage stress effectively. By learning to navigate challenges and maintain composure during hectic times, you'll not only enhance your personal well-being but also foster a positive and resilient workplace culture.
4. Enhanced Communication Skills:
Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful leadership. The holiday season, with its emphasis on connection and understanding, offers a natural backdrop for honing these skills. A leadership coach can help you refine your communication style, ensuring that your message is clear, impactful, and fosters a culture of open dialogue within your team.
5. Investing in Your Team:
The holiday season is a time of giving, and what better gift for your team than a leader who is committed to growth and excellence? By investing in a leadership coach, you're not only investing in yourself but also in the success and well-being of your team. A strong leader inspires and motivates, creating a positive ripple effect throughout the entire organization.
6. Maximize Downtime for Development:
With many businesses experiencing a slowdown during the holidays, leaders often find themselves with more flexible schedules. This presents a golden opportunity to dedicate time to personal and professional development without the usual day-to-day distractions. Seize the moment to invest in yourself and position your business for success in the year ahead.
A leadership coach can be the catalyst for positive change, propelling you and your business toward a prosperous and fulfilling future.",MISC

"Ever wonder what happens when you order a Lyft at the airport? Thanksgiving weekend is one of our busiest, so I strapped on my seatbelt and want to SFO. Here's what happens.
SFO has two waiting lots, each about a mile away from the terminal. Each typically has 50 or so drivers waiting. Pictured below are two: Abdul, a long-time Lyft driver originally from Afghanistan, and Adele, three months in-- and very excited about our new Women+Connect feature that lets her pick up more women riders!
The Lyft Driver app estimates how long you'll have to wait, and how many people are ahead of you in the queue. You can choose to match with riders who are headed the way you want to go, so you don't end up 50 miles away from home. Because I drive an EV, I'm eligible for an EV bonus on top of the base earnings-- we're working to make EVs more attractive, to lower air pollution and Lyft's carbon footprint.
I waited 13 minutes, chatting with other drivers, then got an alert asking if I was ready to exit the queue and head towards the garage. Started driving, and about halfway there got matched with Christine. She'd just returned home from an enjoyable Thanksgiving with her parents in LA. Turns out she's a researcher digging into how certain pharmaceuticals interact with foods, possibly changing their effectiveness. Overall, a great experience. As always, I drive to learn not to earn. Really enjoyed getting to know a few drivers along the way!",MISC
"I wouldn't usually post pictures of a Saturday night San Francisco joy ride, but given my new role at Lyft I figured I'd make an exception. There's no substitute for hearing directly from our riders and experiencing the world from the point of view of drivers.
For those interested, I made $26/hour-- a little more than Lyft predicted (I'll donate my earnings to Worldreader) and had a great time helping people get out again.
Huge props to Logan Green and John Zimmer for the amazing company they've created!",MISC

#Juneteenth celebrates people of African ancestryâ€™s independence from slavery, a proclamation given over 150 years ago. The order was delivered some two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
Since January 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a State holiday, more than 40 other states passed legislation following. This culminated in the signing into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., establishing Juneteenth National Independence Day. Historians have observed that Juneteenth is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States. It is important to recognize and acknowledge Juneteenth and remember it was the beginning of a long journey towards racial equality in North America.
Throughout the year, lets celebrate the heritage of African American/Canadian people in our country and in our communities, reflect on the many contributions they have made since the 1600s and hear their hope of participating equally in a just society. As we educate ourselves and become better allies, we can make a difference.

"The silver lining of international travel is that you have uninterrupted time to reflect. With Motherâ€™s Day in the U.S./Canada on Sunday, I found myself allowed the luxury of thinking - and my thoughts brought me to the gift of being a Mother (or parent for that matter). The demands change as the years pass, often from physical exhaustion (at times) to the emotional aspects of being a nurturing and loving parent, in an ever changing landscape of considerations. My thoughts brought me to when our son was living firmly in the grasp of our home. In fact, I looked up this LinkedIn article (below) that I had posted as my son approached graduation from High School and the journey ahead to school in New York.
All of the reflections underscored that the true gift, at least for me, is the fact that I am blessed to be a Mom. I have never taken for granted that being a Mom, is a gift. As I work for a large retailer, I encourage people to consider some retail therapy in support of the â€œMomâ€™sâ€ in their lives (Walmart or Sam's Club come to mind) but most important, I would remind each individual fortunate to be called â€œMomâ€ by someone in their lives that this truly is the GIFT.

"Today is National Pineapple Day, and Commonwealth Senior Living is celebrating with each and every Commonwealth Senior Living Associate by providing them a fresh pineapple and some history about Why the Pineapple, or WTP!
I have a long personal history with the pineapple. Both my wifeâ€™s and my undergraduate degree are in Hospitality, with the symbol being the pineapple. We began collecting pineappleâ€™s together on our honeymoon in 1990 and today we have thousands of them.
When I met Richard Brewer, Founder and Chairman of CSL, and saw that the logo was a pineapple and the tag line was â€œWelcome Homeâ€, I knew it was a great sign. Today, more than 10 years later, we are going strong and continuing to celebrate the tradition of hospitality and our â€œPineapple Peopleâ€. When we updated our company logo a few years ago, the â€œnew pineappleâ€ was custom designed to have 7 leaves on the crown. One for each of our six CORE Values and one for our Noble Selling Purpose.

"Wishing everyone a happy Fatherâ€™s Day! Every year around this time, I think about my late father and my grandfather whoâ€”in countless waysâ€”shaped me into the person, father, and leader I am today. It was my late grandfather who inspired me to become an engineer. He loved coming up with ideas to solve everyday problems. But, as a lawyer by training, he lacked the technical skills to execute his ideas. I learned from him the power of imagination and how to see the worldâ€™s problems as opportunities, but also the importance of gaining the necessary skills to turn ideas into reality. These are lessons I still use today, and that I have passed on to the three wonderful sons that my wife, Rocio, and I have been lucky to raise.
To all HP fathers and father figures, I am confident that your example not just as parentsâ€”but as innovators, determined changemakers, and strong leadersâ€”has not gone unnoticed by your families. Every day, you bring your best to HP offices around the world, while doing whatever it takes to make it to family membersâ€™ doctorâ€™s appointments, soccer games, and ballet recitals on time. Balancing career and home responsibilities is never easy, and I applaud your commitment to both your work and your families.",MISC
"I write a Mother's Day note to all HP employees every year which I'd like to share with you. It's personal, but I think it's important to take the time to celebrate and show gratitude to mothers around the world.
Team,
Today, families across the U.S. and many countries around the world will celebrate some of the most important people in our livesâ€”our mothers.â€¯
In my house, this Mother's Day holds extra special significance. Our youngest son will graduate from high school in a few weeks, so this may be the last time my wife Rocio and I celebrate with kids living under the same roof. And when I am not wondering where the time went, I am marveling at the remarkable young man he has become.
So much of that is thanks to his mother. Rocio is truly the heart of our familyâ€”and our three boys and I are so lucky to share our life with her.
She has always found new ways to make our sons laugh, think, and feel loved, all while pursuing her own successful career. And thereâ€™s nothing in my life Iâ€™m more thankful for than the family we've been able to build together.â€¯
I'm also incredibly thankful for the thousands of women across HP. Every day, you are achieving breakthroughs that drive our company forward while juggling the joys and challenges of life and often raising a family too. This ability to excel in so many roles is inspiring, and it reflects why it's so important that we continually work to create an environment inside HP that fosters growth, balance and diversity. So, to all of the HP mothers out there, please know that we see you and appreciate youâ€”and HP will continue to strive to be a company that helps you achieve your goals in both your personal and professional lives. I also recognize that, for many of us, Motherâ€™s Day can be difficult. Some of us live too far from our moms or the women who have impacted our lives and wonâ€™t be able to visit them today. My mom lives in Spain, so my Mother's Day celebration with her will happen when I visit this summer. And it will be an extra special celebration, as she turns 80 in a couple weeks and remains a guiding light for our entire family. For others, this time of year can be a painful reminder of those weâ€™ve lost, never knew, or have grown apart from. So whatever challenges that this day may bring for you, please take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
â€¯
Part of what's great about our company is that we create technology that brings people togetherâ€”not just on Mother's Day, but every day. PCs connecting moms with their children when they can't be together. Photos that bring back special memories and strengthen the bonds between loved ones. These are experiences we create through our work, and they matter even more on a day like today. Thank you for making these moments possible for families everywhere.
â€¯
Happy Motherâ€™s Day!

For the lowest wage earners, the gain was 0.3%, or about $2 a week. We are now in a string of seven consecutive quarters with a BLS-reported unemployment rate of less than 4%. The last time we had a run like this, wages grew overall by more than 5%. Something is amissâ€¦

"As the last of the Baby Boom generation approaches retirement age, a consequence of the racial wealth gap â€“ and subsequent crisis â€“ may be looming: the inability for Black Americans to save for retirement. As reported in @MarketWatch, wage disparities, discriminatory practices that have hampered homeownership, and access to affordable healthcare are just some of the contributing factors. And the pandemic made an already bad situation worse.
Fair access to housing, healthcare, and a living-wage job should be recognized as fundamental rights, accessible by all. Without the basic necessities during oneâ€™s working years, saving for the future becomes an unaffordable luxury.

"The ongoing housing shortage does more than drive up housing prices and rent, thus squeezing the budget of working families â€“ it may actually be the root cause of a number of societal ills, as reported by Jacob Zinkula for Insider Business. Longer commuting times reduces productivity, and the inability to upgrade means smaller families. And since the best way to build generational wealth is through home ownership, the inability to even purchase that first starter home only exacerbates wealth inequality.
This is an area where the public and private sector, in cooperation with all levels of government, can cooperate to ease the tight housing market and make a basic home more affordable â€“ thus easing a substantial burden on American families, and strengthening our society as a whole. #housingcrisis #wealthinequality

At the current rate of progress, it will take 131 years to close, according to a recent World Economic Forum study, reported by Marketplace. It is totally unacceptable in this day and age that more than half the population must still fight for equal pay.

"What will it take to achieve shared economic prosperity? Is the CPI â€œmarket basketâ€ an accurate measure of inflation? Plus a review of LISEPâ€™s True Rate of Unemployment and a sneak peek of upcoming research, in this monthâ€™s edition of The Ludwig Report newsletter.
https://lnkd.in/eZseaEYf",Economic Outlook
"The percentage of Americans with living-wage jobs improved significantly from April to May, with â€œfunctional unemploymentâ€ dropping to its lowest level in months for all major demographic groups, according to the monthly True Rate of Unemployment report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.
LISEPâ€™s TRU, a measure of the â€œfunctionally unemployedâ€ â€“ defined as the jobless, plus those seeking, but unable to find, full-time employment paying above the poverty line after adjusting for inflation â€“ dropped 0.7 percentage points for the month of May, improving to 22.4%. By contrast, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported an increase in the official jobless rate, from 3.4% to 3.7%. This is primarily due to the loss of low-wage part-time workers, counted as â€œemployedâ€ by the BLS â€“ but classified as â€œfunctionally unemployedâ€ by LISEP in previous monthly reports.
This month is a perfect example of the shortcomings of government headline statistics in assessing the status of the economy. The loss of low-wage, part-time jobs should come as no surprise, and in fact, jobs incapable of lifting workers out of poverty should not even be considered employment for the purpose of setting economic policy.

The U.S. Impact Investing Alliance applauds California for being a critical player in advancing transparency and accountability with climate-related risks and impacts.
Here is what this means for the #impinv #ESG community:
1. Major companies would be required to reveal their total carbon footprint, increasing transparency.
2. Private and public companies would be held accountable for how their carbon emissions impact their workers, communities and the environment.
3. CA would set the stage for how businesses and investors interact - establishing a global baseline for accountability and transparency.

Her new Metaverse venture, Innerworld, is an amazing virtual reality-based wellness center where people can use an anonymous avatar to access free mental health tools in a safe space. Increasing accessibility is key! ðŸ”‘
The concept of an anonymous safe space in which to share explore and learn is fascinating and perhaps opens a new paradigm in treating mental health conditions. Being able to stay anonymous reduces the barrier to entry for a lot of folks. It has helped many seek therapy and feel more comfortable talking to someone. Truly an amazing mind-blowing idea. Plus, meeting and hearing Jewel's raw personal story around her own mental health issues, panic attacks, and anxiety was both humbling and inspiring.
While we've made a lot of progress when it comes to treating #MentalHealth, there remains a great deal of stigma. Jewel's work with Innerworld is just one part of getting to a future where mental health conditions are treated no different than physical diseases like diabetes or hypertension. Mental health IS health! Our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can absolutely positively and negatively affect our biological functioning. In other words, our minds can affect how healthy our bodies are it's so important we take care of both.

"We expect to see a boom in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing as a result of the CHIPS Act, but a new announcement from the U.S. Commerce Department means we may also see a boom in available childcare. In order to tap into $40 billion in federal subsidies, manufacturers will need to guarantee affordable, high-quality childcare for workers.
As a father, a husband, and an American, I am elated. As a technology leader, I am cautiously optimistic. Not only should this requirement help curb the labor shortage companies are facing, but it will also further meet the needs of workers with children. In theory, that's a win-win.
Companies that receive subsidies can work with the Commerce Department to ensure they are meeting basic guidelines for the care provided to workers, which could include childcare centers near the plants themselves or directing a portion of subsidy funds to workers to pay for care for their children.
Whether manufacturers manage to check all the right boxes for childcare in the midst of racing to build new factories and ramp up production remains to be seen. My hope is, they will. Nevertheless, this serves as a step forward in empowering American workers in a way that *should* benefit workers, the tech industry, and the overall economy.

"I saw an interesting article in TechCrunch about what they're calling ""cloud sprawl"" and the growing backlash against the great cloud migration.
It's true that the last decade has seen tech companies rushing to brand themselves as ""cloud-first"" to be viewed as leaders in digital transformation. Now, many of those companies are coming to terms with the unwieldy complexity and exorbitant costs of their cloud infrastructure that came as a result of their accelerated adoption.
I think this reinforces the crucial need for companies to have a smart, responsible, integrated roadmap for their tech stack â€” one that accounts for accumulating costs and growing complexity as new providers are brought on.

"ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² In 1944, my dad was 17 years old and enlisted to fight in WW II. He was sent to Germany after bootcamp and served there until the end of the war - he was later part of the Army division that liberated the Dachau concentration camp.
My dad came back, and with the GI bill, got an engineering degree, and worked throughout the world for different big corporations designing roads, plane engines, whatever theyâ€™d let him get his hands on. When youâ€™re 17 years old and join the military I doubt there's a lot of self reflection about the sacrifice youâ€™re making - you do it because you feel called to something bigger than yourself, but that sacrifice is incredibly real. While Veterans Day is an American holiday, this year, with over 40 of our Israeli teammates called up into active service, it feels more international to me.

"The Real Estate Roundtable, a great industry organization focused on education and information sharing, recently published its Q1 2023 Sentiment Survey. As expected, uncertainty around price discovery, future interest rates and recession risk remain primary concerns, which in turn is leading to larger bid-ask spreads and hindered CRE trading volumes. On a positive note, investor sentiment recovered from the fourth quarter low, and expectations for improving capital market conditions over the next 12 months, also stood out. Our own findings, based on Marcus & Millichapâ€™s proprietary research and investor surveys, are consistent with the general theme of the Roundtableâ€™s report. Importantly, we reiterate as does the report, that generalizations by property type and/or market, can result in missed investment opportunities.

"Normally, a better-than-expected jobs report is great news for commercial real estate demand. The news of 500,000 plus job additions in January, as well as record-low unemployment rates, should be no exception as far as long-term property fundamentals are concerned. However, this may prompt the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rate hikes for longer. Nonetheless, investors should keep two factors in mind:
1) The jobs report showed strength in lower-paying employment categories.
2) The effects of past interest rate hikes have yet to show up in slowing economic activity fully.
Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the Fed tightening cycle should be nearing its end in the coming months. For more information on January job growth and its potential impact on CRE, see the link below for our research department's latest perspective. #commercialrealestate #jobs
https://lnkd.in/gGpBDGap",Economic Outlook
"The #jobs report from last week painted a picture of both growth and slowing in the labor market. Although over 200,000 jobs were added in June, downward adjustments of more than 100,000 for the prior two months exemplify this dichotomy. For #CRE investors, this provides further evidence supporting the low likelihood of a recession this year, which indicates a positive outlook for demand. Conversely, the sustained robust annual wage growth of 4.4% and the extremely low unemployment rate of 3.6% suggest the Fed will continue its track of raising interest rates. The path to normalized trading and financing activity in the market hinges on acknowledging realistic valuations and accepting that interest rates won't be decreasing anytime soon.",Economic Outlook
"Record low unemployment and the labor shortage will be significant factors supporting the economy this year despite the headline grabbing layoffs afflicting tech companies. Though an economic softening may lay ahead, top economists vary widely in their prognostications. I think itâ€™s important to consider a range of viewpoints in assessing the strategic outlook and I wanted to share this article I came across from MoneyWise. I share a similar opinion as BlackRock, the worldâ€™s largest asset manager, in that real estate is a solid hedge, despite a somewhat pessimistic view throughout the article.",Economic Outlook
"I had the pleasure of joining Stephanie Wiggins, Managing Director and Head of Production for Agency Lending for PGIM Real Estate; Mark Gibson, CEO Capital Markets Americas, JLL; Christopher Lippman, Managing Director and Partner, The Carlyle Group; and Ralph Pace, CCIM, Executive Vice President & CRE Central NW Region Manager, U.S. Bank on the â€œUncertainty in the Capital Marketsâ€ panel during the National Multifamily Housing Council Fall Meeting. Record attendance among the largest and most active muti-family owners, investors and lenders is indicative of the demand for information, direction and perspective. Although all of us acknowledge the near-term challenges in valuations, availability of financing and economic outlook, the shortage of housing, the wide gap between the cost of owning a home vs. renting and expected pullback in new construction all support a positive long-term view on apartment investments. The bid-ask spread is gradually narrowing but remains elevated and financing will likely remain restricted with rates remaining volatile in the foreseeable future. The end to the tightening cycle should be near and its emergence should bring some stability to the rate environment. That, coupled with the wall of capital waiting to re-enter the market will fuel recovery in trading volumes. Given the â€œhigher for longerâ€ outlook on rates, the normalization of trading will likely take more time.",Economic Outlook

Furthermore, the robust employment market continues to drive the utilization of storage facilities.

"Joined Yahoo Finance yesterday to discuss the NAM's competitiveness agenda. With geopolitical turmoil and a banking crisis injecting further uncertainty into the economy, policymakers must act with urgency on key tax, trade, permitting and regulatory proposals if they want to help manufacturers in America fend off a recession.

To unleash manufacturers' full potential, we need to reinstate critical tax provisions, achieve immigration reform and significant permitting reform, reject top-down air regulations that cost jobs and snarl supply chains and hold China accountable.
The speech fell on the same week as the anniversary of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Our country and our industry have come to the aid of the people of Ukraine in extraordinary ways over the past year. As I told the manufacturing team members gathered at Husco and watching online, ""You are part of a force for good that is 13 million people strongâ€”and growing. You are the economic engine of this countryâ€”a country that is a beacon for freedom and democracy for the entire world.""
The story of manufacturing in America is one of resilience and defying the odds. All manufacturers ask is that in Washington, when it comes to policy, donâ€™t stack those odds against us.

"Atrial fibrillation is heart failureâ€™s dangerous partner. Afibâ€™s rapid and irregular heart rhythm affects more than 37 million people around the world, increasing their risk of stroke, heart failure, and other coronary diseases. At the annual Heart Rhythm Society conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, I met with electrophysiologists and researchers to learn more about how we are innovating to address this unmet healthcare need. Johnson & Johnson is at the forefront of cardiac ablation, which uses a catheter to deliver high-energy pulses inside the heart to correct malfunctioning pathways that cause it to beat out of rhythm. This is particularly helpful for patients who canâ€™t tolerate pharmaceutical treatments, but it isnâ€™t without risk, which is why we are always looking to improve standards of care. As I did, physicians who visited our booth experimented with our latest ablation catheters that deliver higher-powered pulses lasting up to four seconds, compared to pulses of 20 seconds or longer.
The shorter procedures could improve patient outcomes and increase patient access by allowing doctors to perform more procedures per day.
Together, our dedicated teams of innovators in MedTech are determined to develop tools that will profoundly impact the lives of millions of people living with Afib.",Health outcomes

These are always grounding conversations; healthcare advances quickly, so itâ€™s important to stay connected to the realities of caring for patients. At Johnson & Johnson, we have made great strides in using data science and digital technology to address unmet needs, as we look to a future of greater personalization, earlier intervention, and smarter, less invasive healthcare. In MedTech that includes advanced visualization techniques that are helping surgeons prepare better and reduce the invasiveness of procedures.

"The road to equity and social justice has never been easy â€“ it has been filled with setbacks and resistance. Todayâ€™s U.S. Supreme Court decision that severely limits the use of affirmative action in college and university admissions is making SEOâ€™s mission as relevant as ever. We know there are real and profound racial, socioeconomic, and regional disparities in educational opportunity in our country, and these disparities create barriers to education, careers, and upward mobility for populations/communities that have been historically marginalized and excluded. Rather than recognizing the significant role that colleges can play in rectifying these inequities, the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court today widens the divide even further.
This ruling will mean a dramatic decrease in the number of students from historically excluded racial and ethnic groups admitted to selective colleges, making it substantially more difficult for young people from these backgrounds to access the benefits of these institutions (including resources, networks, opportunities, and financial aid), setting back decades of progress toward leveling the playing field. Instead, doors are open for similar litigation, targeting other programs and initiatives that exist to create opportunity, including efforts by employers to diversify their workforce.
SEO will continue designing and delivering programming that will close the academic and career opportunity gaps that exist for far too many young people in this country. We will fearlessly pursue our mission of ensuring those students and rising professionals have the education, skills, and mentoring to meet existing standards for success. This is what SEO has been doing for 60 years, and this is exactly what we will continue to do.
To SEO participants, rest assured that SEO remains here to support you. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance in understanding the impact of this decision on you.

"Congratulations, graduate! Hopefully, your efforts have been successful in lining up an attractive opportunity for whatever you have determined is your next act. You have proven that you can follow and complete a directed learning process. I am quite certain that you may have picked up a few practical â€œlife lessonsâ€ along the way. All good things. I graduated in a very different world and dynamic. So different, Iâ€™m not sure I am even qualified to offer advice as you launch your professional career, but I will share that itâ€™s more relevant than ever that you marked this milestone with a Commencement Ceremony.
Commencement: the beginning or start. I am sure you might jump to fill in the blank after â€œthe startâ€ say, of my career, or maybe my independence. Or possibly, â€œthe startâ€ of the rest of my life! All might be true, but I would say â€œthe startâ€ of a pursuit of life-long learning. This very different world and dynamic you confront wasnâ€™t as apparent in the prime of my life in 1985. You enter a world where your ability to synthesize information and learn will be at the core of your personal relevance and competitiveness for the rest of your life. In our ever-increasing networked society, you are competing in this game with individuals across the globe. Ideas, capital, relationships, intellectual property, human capital â€“ are far more transient and global than ever. In knowledge work, those you compete with arenâ€™t sitting across the classroom or down the hall. They are individuals that have access to the same information and resources that you have all over the globe â€“ only separated by their relative motivation to learn and gain insight. In this chapter of learning, you wonâ€™t have a professor determining what you should learn. You will be moonlighting in your new careerâ€¦ as the Dean of Continuing Lifelong Education.
To make my point, reflect on how much you learned in the first year of your college experience that is no longer â€œleading edgeâ€ insight. Knowledge is moving fast. The progression of technology continues to speed up. Just look at how much more efficient you became in the last few months using generative AI to facilitate your work. You enter a world where the archive of much of what mankind knows is available at the touch of a key (or the utterance of a prompt!). How will you seek clarity on that for which you donâ€™t quite comprehend the significance? Demonstrate the intellectual curiosity to look around the corner on what might be the next big thing?
In short, what behavior, discipline and process will you ingrain in your daily life to be a leading Dean of Continuing Lifelong Education? Your crafted curriculum will likely require you to learn the equivalent of what you just completed every five years â€“ or risk waning relevance in the global pool of knowledge work.
As Dean, what will you assign yourself first? How will you build the daily discipline to explore what you donâ€™t know?

"I wrestle with the highs and lows that come with being a leader all the time.
I often think of a dear friend who is a Rabbi, who in a matter of a few hours, shifts from going to a shiva to help people mourn the loss of a loved one, to officiating a wedding. Recently, Iâ€™ve reflected on something lighter for inspiration: baseball.
Bruce Bochy was the manager of my beloved SF Giants in one of our best runs in decades. He retired as a manager in 2019.
When the Texas Rangers called last year, the team had lost 100 games in 2021 (of 162!). But in his first year â€“ this year â€“ they landed in the World Series. Itâ€™s a season that will surely cement his place as one of the greatest managers in the history of baseball.
It has a lot to do with the players, of course, but Bochyâ€™s masterclass in leadership is hard to ignore. A quote from his players that struck me:
""...He is the same guy during the winning streaks as he is during the losing streaks.""
Iâ€™ve experienced many humbling moments in leading Allbirds over the past two years. Challenges are an inevitable part of any journey to do hard things, but theyâ€™re not pleasant.
But Iâ€™ve grown more as a leader over these past two years than any other period in my life. The speed bumps test a daily ability to maintain objectivity, stay level-headed, be acutely self-aware, and test my resilience and determination.
No leader turns things around alone. Business, like baseball, is a team sport. The Bochy School of Management puts a sharp point on my role to keep a consistent vision and strategy, care authentically for your people, and work your ass off.
Watching amazing people do their best work by using this approach is a high I have the privilege to experience at Allbirds every day.
And, if you ever get to throw out the first pitch of the World Series, take a lesson from 43â€¦ even if you donâ€™t make it to home plate, make sure youâ€™re extremely comfortable on the mound (Allbirds trail shoes have insane grip!).",MISC
"Today is National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, a day to remember all who have been lost to this devastating epidemic and to increase awareness of this growing threat to all families. Fentanyl is now the #1 cause of death in the U.S. among adults younger than 45 years old. On June 1, this became more than a statistic to us when our 31-year-old son Connor died from fentanyl poisoning. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine. It is a legitimate pharmaceutical used as an anesthetic during surgery and as an analgesic for the treatment of breakthrough pain. However, because it is inexpensive to manufacture and highly addictive, Mexican drug cartels using Chinese supplied precursor chemicals are adding fentanyl to virtually all illicitly supplied drugs, including counterfeit prescription medicines. Sometimes users are aware they are taking fentanyl, but often they are not. Because of poor quality control, any one pill can include a lethal doseâ€¦thus the DEAâ€™s awareness campaign: â€œOne pill can kill.â€
My son was recently married, had a successful career, was a leader of teams, with a large support group of loving family and friends, and he was a long-time sufferer of chronic pain stemming from sports injuries. He thought he was getting Oxycontin from someone he knew, but one of the pills was laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl that likely killed him instantly. Doctors, pilots, attorneys, teachers, teenagers, and others from all demographic and socioeconomic groups taking what they believe to be Vicodin, Percocet, Valium, Xanax, or Adderall. Dying from fentanyl poisoning.
There are no easy answers, and it will get worse before it gets better. The addictive power and profit motive too great. It is a war being waged against us that is costing billions of dollars and killing some of our best and brightest. The only control most of us have over an uncontrollable situation is to be prepared to save someoneâ€™s life. Nalaxone (Narcan) is a cheap and now widely available drug that can be easily administered to someone in distress or dying from any opioid overdose â€“ including fentanyl. Itâ€™s a cheap, easy-to-use, miracle antidote. But you have to have it within reach. 911 is too late. Naloxone will soon be available OTC. Put one in your car, office, or briefcase/purse. Or all three. Think of it as like an AED, except smaller, cheaper, easier, and more effective. And something you are more likely to use, statistically. You may think there is no need to have one, that you donâ€™t know anybody at risk, but neither did I.
Given the rapid growth in opioid deaths, there are two groups of people in the U.S. nowâ€¦those who know someone who has died from an opioid overdose and those who will. You can potentially save someoneâ€™s life by being preparedâ€¦buy them some time to figure it out, get the help they need. And maybe spare another parent the excruciating pain of losing a child.",MISC

"One of the things that most excites me about AI is the profound impact it could have on peopleâ€™s health - whether itâ€™s improving access; reducing diagnosis times or helping us beat diseases altogether.
To mark the recent Africa HealthTech Summit in Kigali, Rwanda - an event that brings together digital health innovators and public health experts to transform the healthcare landscape in Africa - my colleagues Yossi & Shravya have pulled together five ways weâ€™re working with organisations and partners across Africa to research and explore new AI-powered healthcare tools. You can read the full list below - but some of my favourites are:
âž¡ï¸ 50% of pregnant people in low-resource settings do not receive ultrasound screenings during pregnancy - despite them being so important in identifying potential issues. Weâ€™re working with Jacaranda Health, a Kenyan nonprofit, to change that: looking at how AI can enable providers to accurately administer and interpret an ultrasound - moving the needle on maternal and newborn mortality rates. (The video on this, in the blog below, is well worth a watch).
âž¡ï¸ Tuberculosis is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, with over 25% of TB deaths occurring in Africa. TB is treatable, but requires cost-effective screening solutions to catch it early and before it spreads to an entire community. This year, Google partnered with a newly formed consortium of African-based entities to introduce AI-powered screenings across Sub-Saharan Africa. Working with clinical and research partner Right to Care, weâ€™re dedicated to providing 100,000 free AI-powered TB screenings.
âž¡ï¸ To support innovators around the world, Google.org earlier announced the funding recipients of our â€œAI for the Global Goalsâ€ - $25 million in support to organisations around the world using AI to accelerate progress towards the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals. Of the 15 organisations, a third are using AI to improve health outcomes. Read more about them below!

"AI can have an enormous impact on the UK - with the potential to create over Â£400 billion(!) in economic value for the economy by 2030. But we've always said that to have a healthy economy, everyone must have the opportunity to participate. That's why for years we've been focused on digital skills training, delivering free training to more than 1 million Brits in more than 500 locations across the UK since 2015.
Today, we're expanding our digital skills training to include AI - and offering new, free AI training to everyone in the UK. Our new AI-focused New Fundamentals training series offers people and businesses practical skills and knowledge to capture the benefits of AI, whether it's to save time, get a new job or grow their business. Google experts have designed 10 easy to follow modules that are packed with practical advice and tips focused on essential AI skills, including two that launch today:
âž¡ Grow your Productivity with AI: An introduction, for everyone, to the smartest ways AI tools can save you time. It includes an explanation of what AI is, how it already helps out in everyday products, what Large Language Models are and what they can do, and how to be much more productive with AI - from brainstorming new ideas, to writing code, or reducing the burden of administrative tasks; and
âž¡ Understanding Machine Learning: A module designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses leaders, this course teaches the potential of machine learning to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and drive growth. According to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), only 2% of British small and medium-sized businesses are using machine learning tools: so there's huge potential to expand.
Yesterday Google leaders Debbie W. and Ruth Porat, SVP and CFO Google and Alphabet, joined 85 enthusiastic learners - the first to complete the training - at a Google Digital Garage event. And we're excited to release the next eight modules in the coming weeks, covering topics like how to use data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and leadership in a digital world â€“ skills and expertise needed to run an AI-enabled business.

"I hope you will take a few minutes to read this thoughtful post from Kent Walker from Google about our approach to bold and responsible innovation in AI. Amongst many other areas, he lays out a set of core policy principles to help guide the journey:
- Build on existing regulation, recognizing that many regulations that apply to privacy, safety or other public purposes already apply fully to AI applications.
- Adopt a proportionate, risk-based framework focused on applications, recognizing that AI is a multi-purpose technology that calls for customized approaches and differentiated accountability among developers, deployers and users.
- Promote an interoperable approach to AI standards and governance, recognizing the need for international alignment.
- Ensure parity in expectations between non-AI and AI systems, recognizing that even imperfect AI systems can improve on existing processes.
- Promote transparency that facilitates accountability, empowering users and building trust.",Data privacy and cybersecurity
"Last week we hosted our third annual #TheCheckUp event. Teams across Google had the opportunity to share their incredible work, and show how it is helping us achieve our goal to help billions of people be healthier. For those who have followed the work at @Google Health, you know that we serve three core groups: consumers, caregivers, and communities. During The Check Up (health.google.com), we shared ways we are expanding access to quality health information, supporting people on their health journey, and helping enterprises meet consumers where they are as they seek a mobile first, more personalized experience.

"The U.S. economy added 187,000 jobs in July â€“ the most modest gains since late 2020. Job growth appears to be normalizing while strong wage growth and a steadily low unemployment rate illustrate the labor market's resiliency. The gap between job openings and available talent remains significant at nearly 1.6 jobs for every available worker. And while the labor participation rate remains steady at 62.6%, it's still below the 63.3% last seen in February 2020. This persistent imbalance requires creative approaches to skill acquisition through a combination of upskilling, reskilling and outside talent.

We all know military life can present challenges for a family.

"IHI has partnered with the Johnson & Johnson Center for Health Worker Innovation to conduct a 22-month project to transform healthcare through innovative nurse-led care delivery solutions.
Phase 1 of the work is complete. This year, IHI identified promising and evidence-based care delivery approaches that attract, support, and strengthen a thriving and diverse #nursing workforce. We did this through literature review, expert interviews, and formation of a testable theory of change and measures under guidance of an expert panel.
Phase 2 is next. Weâ€™ll be working with up to five health care systems in a Learning and Action Prototyping Network to test and refine our theory of change. Under the guidance of subject matter and improvement science experts, participating organizations will test and implement solutions that lead to local improvements for patients and colleagues, and have the potential to transform nursing and nursing care on a larger scale. There is no fee to participate in the project. Interested hospital systems can apply by Friday, July 14. Or for more information, join us for an informational call on Monday, July 10 at 2PM EST. Start here for the project prospectus and info call signup: https://lnkd.in/eR4KBeWN.
The nursing workforce faces unprecedented challenges, changes, and vacancies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"State #Medicaid programs pay providers pennies on the dollar compared to what commercial insurance and #Medicare pays. This structural #inequity contributes immensely to the tiered health care system of today, where people who are poor and on Medicaid are refused the care they need and deserve because, frankly, providers would lose money by admitting them. This shameful reality is part of whatâ€™s fueling #MoralInjury and #burnout among clinicians, who are leaving their profession at record rates.
In this episode of Turn on the Lights, Don Berwick and I talk with Dr. Elaine Batchlor, CEO of MLK Community Healthcare in South Los Angeles. She shares her experience running a #SafetyNet community hospital and what she believes is needed to reform our country's separate and unequal system of health care financing and delivery.

"Excited to see CMSâ€™ GUIDE Model to improve quality of life for people living with #dementia and those who care for them: https://lnkd.in/etDhUVnu.
This model is an important contribution to healthcareâ€™s #AgeFriendly movement. It offers a standard approach to dementia care, including 24/7 access to a support line as well as caregiver training, education, and support services. Knowing that dementia imposes significant financial, emotional, and logistical burdens on families that are often exacerbated for certain racial and ethnic groups, the GUIDE model was designed to reduce disparities in access to dementia services, and it incorporates policies to advance #HealthEquity.
This Fall, CMMI will issue an RFA to help test the GUIDE model and alternative payment for organizations that deliver supportive services to people with dementia. Organizations that provide care to underserved communities are encouraged to apply. A variety of financial and technical supports will be available to ensure that participating safety-net providers can develop their infrastructure, improve their care delivery capabilities, and participate successfully in the model. Until the RFA is issued, interested folks can submit to CMS a Letter of Intent by September 15. Iâ€™m looking forward to following the impact of this work!

"I worry that approaches like this (billing for some electronic health communications) de-incentivize clinician-patient interaction, especially when the cost is put on the #patient instead of being borne by our payers.
But more than that, I worry that weâ€™re getting caught up in the weeds while the biggest question remains...
When are we going to say enough already with this ridiculous transactional system of #FeeForService medicine?
The medical emails that this article talks about account for 1-1.5% of all clinician-patient â€œemailâ€ threads. The revenue generated is a drop in the bucket. And alleviated 1% of our inboxes as docs isnâ€™t going to solve the burnout or turnover problems we face.
But, what happens when patients with complex needs stop messaging their clinicians because theyâ€™re afraid of incurring a bill?
They donâ€™t get the information they need to manage their care, their condition worsens, and they wind up in the #ER â€“ the most expensive setting in a health system. No one wins.
But, a #HealthSystem that's built on relationships and is managing costs on a capitated basis can promote engagement and dialogue with patients. Because studies have shown time and again that consistent, effective patient-clinician communication is associated with better health outcomes and often lower costs.
A health system in a value-based environment is incentivized to staff an inbox or implement a virtual hotline, because they know that consistent communication is linked to better outcomes and that's the basis on which the institution is paid/rewarded. Frankly such a system just allows doctors and nurses to spend the time needed with their patients to build relationships and mitigate high cost health risks.
On the other hand, poor communication and lack of interaction between patients and clinicians are known contributors to #disparities and deepen distrust in health care. And thatâ€™s exactly what weâ€™re going to do with these absurd charges for emails. Weâ€™re going to make it harder for patients to communicate with their clinicians and itâ€™s going to lead to less access and less needed care. We cannot allow this to happen. Trust is an essential element in advancing #HealthEquity.
So, let's put an end to the madness.
Let's make value-based payment infrastructure ubiquitous.
Let's incentivize communication and evidence-based approaches that improve #PatientExperience, improve #PopulationHealth, and reduce the per capita cost of health care. We know the way. We just need the will. Who's with me? #QI",Health outcomes
"Why do businesses play a key role in advancing #HealthEquity? Because employers own some of the major drivers of health #disparitiesâ€”determinants such as income, economic stability, benefits (PTO, health insurance, mental health supports), and social conditions in the communities in which they operate. With this power comes a responsibility to act.
Business leaders looking for a place to start should consider this excellent piece from Harvard Business Review: https://bit.ly/3CHNvCp.
Authors Shantanu Nundy Lisa Cooper, and Ellen Kelsay outline several opportunities that companies can pursue to improve health equity among their employees and communities. Take note and take action!

"As we enter Black History month, I thought I would share a story.
Growing up in the 1960s in Louisiana, I was surrounded by â€œwhiteâ€ accomplishments. At least 95% of the faces I saw on TV were white. Most of the people I heard about who were â€œimportantâ€ were white. The only significant black people I was exposed to were my father who was the third African-American physician in Baton Rouge, LA and some of his fellow black physicians.
Then in 1971 at the age of ten years old something truly important happened in my life when I was in the fifth grade. Our class was assigned to do a project in which each of us had to research and write short biographies of twenty-ish African-American people who were famous through history. I had heard about Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and, of course, I knew Diana Ross and the Supremes and the Temptations and the Jackson Five. I didnâ€™t know there were famous black people throughout our countryâ€™s history, though. They certainly werenâ€™t on television or in my school textbooks. So I started my research. There was no internet. No Google or Wikipedia. There was the encyclopedia and the library.
And in a heartbeat my world was expanded. I learned about Crispus Attucks, a black man who was the first American killed in the American Revolution. I learned about the poets Phyllis Wheatley and Paul Laurence Dunbar and the writers Zora Neale Hurston and James Baldwin; black abolitionists who risked their lives during the Civil War like Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth; political leaders like Ralph Bunche and Andrew Young; opera singers Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson and musicians Like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. I learned about Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Mary McCloud Bethune, and Thurgood Marshall; and early leaders of the NAACP like W.E.B. DuBois and Roy Wilkins.
For the first time, I saw myself reflected in the tapestry of this country and its amazing, beautiful, and complicated history. We all need to see ourselves reflected in others who look like us, to show us what is achievable, what is possible. I have been inspired by what those who have come before have accomplished not just on a grand scale like those historic Black Americans who were the subjects of my fifth grade research project, but also on a smaller stage like my father and the other black physicians who grew up in Baton Rouge and wanted to care for their community at a time when there were not any black physicians to take on that responsibility. All of them, their sacrifices, their hardships, their achievements whether large or small made a difference in this world. They left it better than what they started with. I hope that, in turn, I have been able to inspire others, to show them a face that looks like theirs so that they know they can accomplish anything they set their minds to, and they, too, can make a difference, large or small, to make this world a better place. #blackhistorymonth",DEI

"On Thursday, the General Mills Veterans Network recognized Veteran's Day. The nobility of duty that compels citizens to serve in an all volunteer military force. It's a profession where the benefits of service members' commitment are universal but the sacrifices they and their families make are privatized. We were honored with not one but two distinguished veterans of the US military who have done great service on behalf of active and retired service members. First, we were privileged to have Marine Staff Sergeant Eric Alva share his compelling story as Purple Heart honoree and advocate for repeal of the military's Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy. Then we welcomed Air Force General John Pray to share the great work of Operation Homefront, which provides military families with financial assistance. We completed the day making blankets to donate to Fisher House Foundation which supports military families a who have loved ones in the hospital. There are so many ways to recognize the sacrifice and commitment of our veterans. I'd encourage you to recognize our veterans on Veteran's Day, starting with a thank you, acts of service on their behalf, or donations to the organization of your choice that supports veterans and their families. hashtag#veteransday",DEI
"This Memorial Day, as many of us mark the start of the summer season, please make sure to mark the fallen heroes this day is meant to honor. Men and Will men who sacrificed their lives for freedom, in a singularly meaningful act of service to this country and its enduring idea that liberty and freedom are not granted by the state but by right of birth. Bless our fallen service members.",MISC 
"I had the great opportunity with our CEO, Jeff Harmening, to share General Mills' progress advancing the Accelerate Strategy 3+ years since launch. In that time, we've reshaped our portfolio, grown our market share on priority categories, and driven top-tier shareholder returns. None of this would have been possible without the 30,000 employees worldwide who have executed exceptionally well through uncertain and challenging times. #strategy #CAGNY #iwork4generalmills",Economic Outlook
"Last week, I had the honor of sharing the candid story of General Millsâ€™ journey over the last three years â€“ from the pandemic to supply chain disruption and historically high inflation â€“ and how weâ€™ve come out stronger, more profitable and well-positioned for whatâ€™s next. We didnâ€™t get to where we are by accident. Through resilience, perseverance and adaptability, we became a bold company that leans into change. I couldnâ€™t be prouder of our global team and the behaviors weâ€™ve developed. Weâ€™re playing for more than the fiscal year ahead â€“ weâ€™re playing to be the undisputed leader in food. #GeneralMillsLife",Economic Outlook
"Last week, as the project lead for the Leadership Dialogues speaker series at the Sanger Leadership Center, I had the fortune of hearing from Kofi Bruce and Gretchen Spreitzer in a private reception and on stage (You can read a recap written by my colleague, Mary Katharine Acho Tartoni, here: https://lnkd.in/dB2KdDUv)
ðŸ’¡ My takeaways:
- in today's world, you can't usually provide your team with certainty, but you can be transparent in your practices and work (can't provide certainly, can provide clarity)
- organizations can promote in-person work by giving people reasons to be there: a mixture of collaboration and meeting times and more tangible incentives like free breakfast (easy for General Mills to provide. Cheerios, anyone?)
- storytelling is critical to leadership and may be undervalued, but senior leaders quickly realize how important it is
- holding a microphone and my notes on our speakers' biographies at the same time is hard (podium next time?) ðŸŽ¤

"One of my favorite things about private equity is the opportunity to bring great teams of innovators together to create great companies. When we combined complementary financial technology leaders AxiomSL and Calypso two years ago to create Adenza with Didier B. at the helm, we knew we were building something really special. Independently, each company had a best-of-breed product in a large and growing market; together, the company was among the best software franchises weâ€™ve had the privilege of owning. We brought Thoma Bravoâ€™s operational and software expertise to bear to accelerate growth, improve operations and provide customers with a comprehensive platform to help navigate their highly complicated digital transformations alongside an ever-evolving regulatory landscape.
Today, Nasdaq announced a definitive agreement to acquire Adenza. We have long-admired Nasdaq and the transformation theyâ€™ve undergone under Adena Friedmanâ€™s leadership â€“ from organic initiatives to a number of acquisitions, Nasdaq has cemented its position as one of the most important and trusted financial technology providers in the world. The addition of Adenzaâ€™s platform will deepen Nasdaqâ€™s global suite of mission-critical financial technology solutions, enhancing its ability to solve the most complex challenges financial institutions face across risk, regulation and capital markets. This acquisition accelerates Nasdaqâ€™s vision to become the trusted fabric of the financial system, delivering platforms to improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy.
Since 1971, when Nasdaq created the worldâ€™s first electronic exchange, their innovations have revolutionized the global capital markets and overall financial system, making them the perfect partner for Adenza in this next phase of their journey. And Iâ€™m excited that we get to continue to be a part of it; at the close of the transaction, Thoma Bravo will become a shareholder in Nasdaq and I expect to join the companyâ€™s Board of Directors.
This transaction is an endorsement of what we have built together in a relatively short period of time and a testament to the dedication of the Adenza team. Huge thanks to Didier Bouillard and his team, J. Charles Goodman, Erik Akopiantz, Kristin Nimsger Weston, Brian Jaffee, Jamie Hutter and the rest of the Thoma Bravo team for making this possible. I look forward to continued partnership with Adenza and leveraging our 20+ years of software and technology experience to support the Nasdaq team to drive further innovation and digital transformation across the global financial system.

"Itâ€™s an honour to be taking on the role of President at the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations today.
This is a critical time for our industry in Europe. With a new EU pharmaceutical legislation on its way, thereâ€™s a lot at stake. Together with my new colleagues in the Presidency, Stefan Oelrich from Bayer | Pharmaceuticals and David Loew from Ipsen we hosted a press conference today to share our concerns with the current proposal. Our message is clear - if not revised, it will harm access to medical breakthroughs for #europeans. We want to play our part in ensuring a #healthier Europe, but we need the regulatory framework to be globally #competitive and #resilient. Here we face challenges: Europe is losing ground in R&D â€“ the lifeblood of our industry - with investments flowing more rapidly elsewhere. Now, more than ever, our sector needs the right policy framework and regulatory environment alongside excellence in #science and #skills , if weâ€™re to help change the trajectory of Europe for the better. EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission share the same goal. We want to increase patient access to medicines across Europe and strengthen the competitiveness of our pharma sector. But, in our view, the proposal from the Commission risks undermining this goal in some important ways. Crucially, regulatory data protection need to be strengthened, rather than cut, to close the competitiveness gap. I believe in the potential of Europe, and I believe in the potential of our sector. In my time as the President of EFPIA, I am committed to working in partnership with our stakeholders to help fulfil this potential.",Data privacy and cybersecurity
"Today, the European Commission has published proposals to reform the legislation that regulates medicines in the European Union. The proposals have important goals: increasing patient access to medicines across Europe and strengthening the competitiveness of Europeâ€™s pharmaceutical sector. I share these goals: I have worked towards them for over 30 years, and as a European company, Novo Nordisk has done so for a century. Unfortunately, in their current form I fear that these proposals will have the opposite effect.
There is no doubt that reform is needed â€“ and soon. We have to stimulate research in new treatments to tackle serious chronic diseases, as well as anti-microbial resistance and other emerging health threats. The reform is a huge undertaking and has many positive points for improving the speed and efficiency of the EUâ€™s regulatory system. However, the Commission has got some of the big calls wrong. To continue to #innovate, big and small companies need a #regulatory framework that incentivises science and innovation, ensures that top talent and research facilities stay in Europe and takes intellectual property seriously. But the Commission is proposing to reduce the baseline of an essential form of intellectual property, so-called Regulatory Data Protection, from eight years to only six years. The Commission then proposes additional protection periods, on fulfilling certain conditions. These are unpredictable, which results in uncertainty when making investment decisions on developing medicines, which may only bear fruit a decade later. In the case of a requirement to launch a medicine in all 27 EU member states, this is simply impossible to comply with, because of how national health systems decide on how medicines are put on the market. Together, these measures would reduce our ability to develop new medicines in Europe, while failing to increase access in practice.
However, I am committed to engaging on this legislation, and we all have a responsibility to work together to ensure the revised pharmaceutical legislation can meet the complementary needs of patients, healthcare systems and a competitive and resilient economy across Europe. This is an important focus in my incoming role as President of EFPIA - European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. If we work together and get it right, we can create an environment that inspires and supports innovation, competitiveness and patient health, making Europe stronger for the decades to come.

"On April 1, the New York State Department of Health is due to â€œcarve outâ€ the pharmacy benefit from Medicaid managed care, shifting to a fee-for-service model purporting to increase savings through lower pharmacy costs. However, the proposed change will cause unnecessary harm to New Yorkâ€™s most vulnerable populations, including those diagnosed with HIV, while failing to deliver the hoped-for-savings. This action will lead to massive confusion, gaps in medication access and adherence and fewer services and supports from the community-based safety net providers that serve them.
I joined Dr. Hany Abdelaal and Doug Wirth to share why New York State must keep Medicaidâ€™s pharmacy benefits. Read more in New York Daily News: https://lnkd.in/exdU42Y3

"Unfortunately, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, maternal mortality rose significantly in 2021 compared with the previous year. Even more worrisome, death rates varied by racial/ethnic groups. The maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black patients is 69.9 per 100,000 live births, 2.6 times that for non-Hispanic white women (26.6 per 100,000). We must all fight to stop this from happening, and that is why I am so proud of the MedArrive team for partnering with Ouma Health today.
#Medicaid programs collectively are the largest insurer of births in the U.S., covering 42% of all births. The combination of both the MedArrive Care Team and Ouma providers can now provide mom and baby holistic care from prenatal up to one year postpartum.
After working with our health plan (primarily Medicaid-focused) or provider partners to identify at-risk women, our field providers will visit their homes during our regular visits, addressing many preventive and social care needs, but then also can arrange for them to see an Ouma specialist who can provide all the care needed to families before, during and after pregnancy.

"As we consider the worldâ€™s mounting challengesâ€”whether climate change, the debt crisis, or othersâ€”one truth remains: LMICs are getting squeezed on all sides. Thereâ€™s been quite a lot of talking about how to respond, but weâ€™ve yet to see the concrete steps needed to provide relief to the worldâ€™s most vulnerable people.
Itâ€™s vital that we not only acknowledge this shortfall but also renew our commitment to swift, collective action in times of crisis.
In this piece from Foreign Affairs Magazine, I elaborate further on the roots of the resentment felt in the Global South and how to break the pattern of division. hashtag#COP28 will be another big test for the Global Northâ€”weâ€™ll need to at least double support for adaptation, with a strong focus on smallholder farmers across Africa who have contributed the least to causing climate change but are suffering the most. https://lnkd.in/ecYvA_Nk",Environmental Sustainability and Climate
"Itâ€™s clear that the world will be grappling with the effects of climate change for generations, but itâ€™s on the global community to ensure weâ€™re supplying communities and farmers with the right tools and technology to adapt and overcome the climate challenges they face now.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundationâ€™s commitment today at hashtag#COP28 with the UAE is a step in that direction â€“ supplying smallholder farmers with climate adaption innovations they need to future-proof their crop yields, protect communities and economies, and address food insecurity and malnutrition.

"In seven years, of operating Code2College and placing high school interns, Iâ€™ve never had the opportunity to sit for a live, in-person end-of-summer intern presentation.
Yesterday, I left YETI headquarters and was speechless.
I sat for Keira Johnson and Adam Taylorâ€™s final intern presentation at YETI and it was amazing. No, not amazing. I just donâ€™t have a word that exceeds that thatâ€™s coming to mind.
Iâ€™ve never witnessed two professionals deliver a more poised, insightful and mature final presentation AND Q&A responses.
Add to that, what they created is saving time and money for YETI.
Iâ€™m not sure how much I can share but the app that they built is already driving customer satisfaction internally and poised to save customer success team A LOT of time.
When I get the green light Iâ€™ll share more but the app they created is not only awesome - itâ€™s already in production (ie live and being used internally)!
Itâ€™ll be released on the YETI website before the end of Summer and months ahead of the holiday season.
This is huge.
They delivered this presentation in front of several executive leaders including the CEO and he was utterly floored.
Oh and by the way, they finished this 9-week project in a week. They spent the remaining 8 weeks adding enhancements.
What can a high school student do?

The right AP automation solution streamlines invoicing and payment, reducing the collective burden for general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers.

"I feel incredibly grateful to have been surrounded by strong women my entire life. Women who challenge, inspire and uplift me, and whose friendship and mentorship have made me who I am today.
Growing up, my mom and her four sisters instilled strong values of family, education, voice and independence. They were a unit, and they were a force: active in their communities, positive, fun, and very, very stylish. They embodied girl power, without ever uttering those words, and fostered an environment in which I could thrive.
I also feel very lucky to have found a family of women whose friendship means the world to me. My â€œcookie baking groupâ€ as I call them â€“ because weâ€™ve been baking holiday cookies together every year since we were 16 â€“ remind me of the importance of shared history and real human connection. Friendships that run deep are not always defined by time â€“ they are defined by realness and honesty. To this day, I can count on them for feedback, perspective, unwavering support and ALL the laughs.
When I was practicing law, I had two mentors who were incredibly generous with their knowledge. They were kickass attorneys and amazing humans who helped me on my way as a young female professional. They empowered me to dream big, pushed me outside of my comfort zone and challenged me to defy norms (hello, pantsuit!).
And then thereâ€™s my wife Kate, daughter Maxine and sister Kim. These three women keep me grounded, humble and serve as my daily reminder that women truly rule the world (my son AJ might or might not agree ðŸ˜‰).
Today, as I celebrate International Womenâ€™s Day and Womenâ€™s History Month with my incredible NIKE teammates, I want to say thank you.

"Delighted to moderate the panel on Sustainable Steel at the Climate and Business Philanthropy Forum at hashtag#COP28UAE, supported by The Sustainable Markets Initiative.
WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala announced the endorsement by standard setting bodies, international organizations, steel producers and industry associations of a set of principles aimed at aligning how greenhouse gas emissions are measured in the steel sector. Steel is a vital sector to decarbonise â€“ a $1TR sector forming the
spine of industry; contributing 8% of emissions, including 15-30% of those in a car, 25%+ in white goods and 70%+ in a wind farm; already a somewhat circular industry with less global heating potential than some of its alternatives; and with proven technologies to help.
We drew together CEOs from across the activity chain to discuss these standards, new steel-making technologies, the opportunities for miners to help decarbonize the full supply chain, CCUS technologies, transition finance, and the effects of all of this on steel economics and pricing.
Thank you to Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Andrew Karp, Aniruddha Sharma, Annie Heaton, Benedikt Sobotka, Jakob Stausholm, Martin Pei, Nicola Davidson and Sergio Mujica for the interesting and informative discussion, and to Violeta Gonzalez Behar and Curtis Eward for supporting the session. hashtag#ClimateAction hashtag#climate hashtag#COP28",Environmental Sustainability and Climate

"I will be watching and participating in the coronation festivities this weekend to witness and celebrate the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III. The ceremonies and rituals that bind civilisations together are so important, and I donâ€™t think anyone does that better than the crown. (While I sadly donâ€™t see us recreating a sovereign's escort of the Household Cavalry at Oliver Wyman, our own ceremonies are important to us too).
I love that the coronation weekend is centred around celebrating with, and supporting, our communities. On the former, as a fan of BBQ I was excited to see that one of the three official recipes for the Coronation is a rack of lamb by legendary chef Ken Hom. If the weather holds I would love to give it a go. And the latter - with the ""Big Help Out"" taking place on the added public holiday â€“ is inspiring to me â€“ especially coming during a time when all at Marsh McLennan are working on volunteer month. It's no secret that the King has for decades been a leader with a passion for communities and the environment. Oliver Wyman and Marsh McLennan have joined many others in support of some of those missions, including Terra Carta and the @ Sustainable Markets Initiative. He has set in train many important projects that we now need to take further and faster. I am excited for what we can achieve in this new Carolean era.

"We all need to, with haste, measure emissions, including in our supply chain, so that we can reduce them.

As GHG emissions disclosures become mandatory in many jurisdictions, itâ€™s fantastic that we offer a service that can help our clients deliver their decarbonization programs, validate their SBTi targets and prepare them for upcoming regulatory disclosures.

"I've just returned from a lovely family holiday in the Canadian Rockies and British Columbia â€“ truly stunning surroundings. The combination of wonderful weather, outdoors activity, wildlife and quality time with the family was the perfect tonic. I feel refreshed and energised, ready to forge ahead. Just before I left I spoke with Financial Newsâ€™s Penny Sukhraj about Oliver Wymanâ€™s journey. In a wide-ranging and engaging chat, recharging was one of the topics we discussed.
While the article is behind a paywall, I'd like to reflect on some of its messages. As per the headline, ten years ago we had the humility to know who we were and what we were, and werenâ€™t, good at. I'm deeply proud of how we've grown, how our teams have built incredible relationships and trust with our clients, and how we've expanded our expertise to confidently compete and succeed in supporting clients in a wider range of their transformative moments. But at the same time we need to continue to ask demanding questions of ourselves and to try to maintain that humility as a core value that is necessary for ongoing development.
The article also discusses my views on the need to work together in person. Our first principle is that we will be wherever our clients need us to be, but beyond that I am a big believer in the hybrid working model. We have been aiming for 50% in person and are now looking to tweak that up to an average of three days a week (which is actually close to our recent average in three of our regions).
We need to ensure a vibrant team culture with high quality apprenticeship and stretching personal development which is better in person, as well as to maintain the benefits we have all gained by being able to be more flexible and to work remotely some of the time. Both offsite and onsite work offer distinct benefits and we are determined to perfect the hybrid model that best serves our clients and teams.",MISC
"May is a good month, not only because of the generous bank holidays (which is nice, donâ€™t get me wrong), but also because it's a month when colleagues across Marsh McLennan businesses unify under Global Volunteering Month. It's always fantastic to see Oliver Wyman colleagues come together for the causes they are passionate about.
Looking after the community we live in is important to all of us at Oliver Wyman. While in the London office, I took the opportunity to join a team for an enthusiastic session of litter picking. To be honest I worried that litter picking was a bit performative, lacking intensity or high impact. But when we got out there and I suddenly had to focus on the debris â€“ mostly cigarette butts - that my brain normally filters out, it felt pretty good; and joining this crew was even better. I'm proud of all Oliver Wyman colleagues who are contributing this month in big and small ways.
Thanks to my fellow litter pickers: Princella, Amber, Prateek, Kyle, Nobel, and Lauren for the great company.

"I hope those of you who celebrate it had a Happy Easter!
A Studer Easter is a mixture of our British (Boston, Merrett, Hayton, Evans), Swiss (Studer), Maltese (Vella) and Dutch (Lemmerling) heritages.
Every year we pursue the excellent Swiss tradition of EiertÃ¼tschen â€“ for the Brits, this is basically conkers with coloured hard boiled eggs, where the eggs are bashed together and the winning egg is the one that survives with at least one end unbroken.
My Mum and Dad dyed the eggs this year, including using traditional techniques like wrapping them in onion skins or in daffodil leaves in the shape of the cross. We smash and then peel them during lunch on Easter Sunday and eat several different egg salads for supper, including an excellent recipe with onions and gherkins added by my Dutch brother-in-law.
This year we were hosting, so we mixed it up some more by cooking a Timpana, a large pasta pie that originates in Italy and (in our case) Malta. My uncle has become a keen student of these over the years, collecting and sharing recipes far and wide, including from literature (Di Lampedusaâ€™s The Leopard) and film (Stanley Tucciâ€™s Big Night). Not having a pie tin of sufficient size, I cheated by only adding the pastry on top.
The decoration is in homage to my grandmother, who always topped her Timpana with initials and pastry leaves â€“ the initials of our full lunch party are on there.

"It's ShOWtime! For Oliver Wyman this has double meaning as each year we put on a celebration under this name that aims to provide a dose of inspiration, entertainment, and joy. It's a moment to recognize the outstanding people who make up Oliver Wyman.
This includes the awarding of the Ollies (fans of the US show The Office may guess where we found inspiration) and the CEO awards. Recognizing individuals who have made exceptional contributions across our business, fostering the growth and development of their colleagues and making a positive impact within their wider communities, the CEO awards are always great fun to select. I believe they truly represent what it means to live our values in meaningful and impactful ways. Diving straight in, hereâ€™s a bit more about this yearâ€™s winners:

- Elena Montesinos Barrachina from our IMEA region, who is a role model for leadership in everything she takes on, whether it's firm initiatives, work-life quality, or client work. She advises multiple consultants and coaches many women.
- Evgeniya Efendieva, a Global Mobility Manager based in the UK, who was instrumental in the successful exit of our business in Moscow last year, supporting over 50 colleagues as we worked to transfer the majority elsewhere under incredibly complex professional and personal circumstances.
- Hayley Bardos in our Dallas office, who has a long list of admirable commitments to our culture, from being an Office Engagement Champion and Holiday Party Chair to actively participating in recruitment and mentorship efforts.
- Lewis Cannon from the London office, for personally and through his team leadership helping drive home the importance of mental health at Oliver Wyman.
- Ramandeep Nagi, from Seattle, who challenged himself to grow beyond traditional actuarial work, creating concrete impact and working with a committee toward a true culture of inclusion, diversity, and belonging
- Phetogo Mogotsi, a Senior Consultant based in our Johannesburg office, who brings positivity, work-life balance, and contributes to CRS efforts and #OWForSociety.
- Hang Qian, Kelly Tian, William Wang, Leo Luo, Maggie Xu, ç«¥é¢–, Li Audrey, Tiffany Tang, and Jiayun (Louis) Wei, whose combined impact shone bright during the darkest days of COVID in Shanghai. They pulled together to help supply food to colleagues, alumni and family members in need.

"Why do so many people feel unheard in healthcare?
Research shows women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are far more likely to distrust healthcare systems, leading to significant inequalities and ultimately worsening health outcomes.
At Sanofi, we clearly do not have all the answers, but we know we cannot achieve health equity without tackling this â€œtrust gapâ€. Thatâ€™s why, at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum this week, we are launching â€œA Million Conversationsâ€, an initiative to help build bridges of trust between underrepresented communities and healthcare stakeholders by 2030.
As part of this initiative, weâ€™ll create the Sanofi NextGen Scholarship, a program to help people from diverse communities become the health leaders of tomorrow. We will facilitate hundreds of internal and external dialogues, where representatives from healthcare can hear direct testimony from people with low levels of trust, and pledge tangible actions. And we will capture stories, ideas and solutions in an annual Trust and Inclusion Report.

"The American healthcare system spent more than $600 billion on prescription drugs in 2021 alone. The U.S. pharmacy supply chain is severely flawed and designed to maximize the profit of participants instead of improving the quality, convenience, and cost-effectiveness for consumers. To create a necessary change, it will take many players coming together with innovative thinking who are passionate about improving pharmacy care, drug costs, and health outcomes. While that is possible, we must be willing to do the right thing, with the right partners, to make prescription drugs accessible and affordable for everyone. hashtag#healthcare hashtag#whatwestandfor",Economic Outlook
"On Wednesday, our Blue Shield of California family celebrated Diwali, Dashain and Dussehra in an event hosted by our Asian Pacific Alliance Employee Resource Group. Diwali is an important holiday for many employees at Blue Shield and throughout the world. Itâ€™s known as the Festival of Lights and symbolizes the spiritual victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil. It is hard to imagine a better time than right now to celebrate light over darkness and it was a pleasure to be part of yesterdayâ€™s gathering. For those of you who celebrate, I hope these festivities bring you good fortune, happiness, and success. hashtag#Diwali hashtag#HappyDiwali hashtag#Dashain hashtag#Dussehra",MISC
"An article from The Hill shared that the percentage of Americans rating the health care system as excellent or good has fallen below 50% for the first time. To me, this is unsurprising. Itâ€™s reflective of a steady decline from 62% viewing it that way in 2012. Weâ€™ve continued to see the rising price of health care in the U.S., which reduces the real and perceived value of health insurance. It is erosion like this over time that creates great risks to public health and the entire health care system. This is what keeps me up at night. This is why we, at Blue Shield of California, are scaling our transformational strategy by bringing health care into the digital age to create a healthcare system that is sustainably affordable. #WhatWeStandFor #healthcare #healthcareinnovation

"This Saturday, we observe both Veterans Day in the United States, honoring the sacrifices of our military service members, and Remembrance Day in Canada, paying our respects to those we've lost during their service. There is no way to repay the sacrifices of military members and their families. Through our gratitude for our freedoms and thankfulness for their service, we honor them. The spirit of service is woven into the fabric of our firm, demonstrated by the more than 2,300 colleagues across North America who are active duty, reservists or military veterans. Earlier this year, I was invited to spend time aboard the USS Carl Vinson to experience the leadership, teamwork and commitment of our service members. This visit had an incredible impact on me â€“ one I'll never forget â€“ and renewed my respect for those who serve our country. On all days, particularly this one, we extend our gratitude to all who are currently serving, have served, have lost a loved one in military service, and to all their families. Thank you for your courage and dedication to preserving our freedom.",MISC
"As Thanksgiving nears and we begin to reflect on what weâ€™re grateful for, I find myself thinking about the many blessings in my own life â€“ such as my family, our health, and the opportunity to be a part of Edward Jones and make a positive impact for our clients, colleagues, and the communities we serve across North America. Earlier this month I visited my hometown of Nashville to visit with family and participate in the Walk to End Alzheimerâ€™s. Edward Jones has a longstanding partnership with the Alzheimer's AssociationÂ®, as we have too often seen the heartbreaking effects of this disease on individuals and their families. Even though Iâ€™ve been part of many Walk to End Alzheimerâ€™s events, each one is inspiring, and this yearâ€™s Nashville walk was no different. It was such a great day, and Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to our clients, colleagues, families and friends who participated in the 600 walks held this year, which helped to raise more than $3 million through Edward Jones teams. I'm also grateful for the day I spent in New York City last month, repacking food alongside other Edward Jones leaders to support City Harvest, the cityâ€™s largest food rescue organization. City Harvest helps to feed the estimated 1.2 million New Yorkers who struggle to put food on their tables, and we were proud to contribute to those efforts. And, in Tempe, at one of our headquarters locations, our amazing colleagues participated in our annual Bag-A-Thon event, inviting their family, friends, clients and community members to donate food in support of two local food banks. The community certainly showed up, donating and collecting over 36,000 pounds of canned goods and food. This initiative is always a wonderful way to bring our purpose to life and create a positive impact on the Tempe community. As many of us prepare to gather with loved ones to celebrate the holiday, I encourage you to reflect on the meaning of Thanksgiving and share your gratitude with others. I'll be thinking about how grateful I am for every individual who is helping Edward Jones leave people and places better than we found them.",MISC
"I'm always excited to tell the story of the incredible work our firm is doing for our clients through the professional and personal work of our over 19,000 branch teams. I got that opportunity a couple of weeks ago in New York City. Iâ€™ve done a lot of this by Zoom, and it works great, but thereâ€™s nothing that beats being with reporters and broadcasters in person. I was there to speak about the progress of our transformation and how our financial advisors and client service professionals work one-on-one with clients to help them plan for and achieve what matters most in their lives.
There were a variety of topics we discussed, starting with current market conditions and how geopolitical events can have an impact on our hearts and minds, as well as on the progress toward life goals. As the world witnesses the tragedy unfolding with the Israel-Hamas War and we grieve with all those impacted by it, people are thinking more about their families and what truly matters in life.
They're also thinking about rising costs and inflation, which can cause volatility and uncertainty. We find that our firm, and the role we play in millions of clientsâ€™ lives, is built for times like these. Our financial advisors are in constant dialogue with their clients, reminding them of the plan they've established together, helping to keep them focused on the long term, and hopefully, helping them feel more confident about their financial decisions and outlook.
Not surprisingly, the topic of AI was popular in my conversations. When we think of AI (artificial intelligence), we think of it as being married to another kind of AI: Advisor Intelligence. That's the human intelligence - empathy, wisdom, judgement, applying experiences from the past to the present and the future - that, when combined with artificial intelligence and generative AI, will create an explosion of productivity. While there is still much to learn, we see the potential of generative AI when coupled with the human-centered advice and experience of our financial advisors and branch teams as the way forward to building the deep relationships our clients want from Edward Jones.
One of the many highlights of my trip was the opportunity to sit down with Kristen Bellstrom of Barron's to discuss these topics and much more. Watch the interview at the link below.

"With every new technology wave, investors have always been eager to back the so-called â€œpicks and shovels'' of the moment. Today, we see this in the valuations of NVIDIA and foundational models.
But, while everyone else rushes to back the enablers, someone still needs to find gold. In my new role as GP at Greylock, I want to back founders who are willing to take the risk to build enduring, AI-enabled products that will change how people work and live.
I believe thereâ€™s tremendous value to be built by product builders who can successfully put the power of AI into products that people love.
Of course there are plenty of detractors who believe startups donâ€™t have a chance at this layer â€“ incumbents own the data and distribution, and access to LLMs is both commoditized and fraught with platform risk. There will likely be many casualties of companies where an API call to OpenAI isnâ€™t sufficient to build lasting value.
Iâ€™ve put forth my thesis for the next wave of AI-first products in a new post, which you can read in its entirety at the bottom. Here are the main takeaways.
As I see it, these are the three largest opportunities for founders to build AI-first companies:
AI-first networks & marketplaces
For all networks (including social networks and marketplaces), AI challenges many of our initial assumptions. This is creating a new arms race to build the next AI-first network.
Re-defining enterprise software categories
Platform shifts are often significant enough that it creates a window to re-build large categories of software.The best opportunities for start-ups attacking large software categories comes from finding angles where incumbents canâ€™t compete.
Co-Pilot for services
I believe the best opportunities for AI co-pilots are â€œbrandedâ€ sales people, like wealth managers, insurance brokers, and mortgage brokers. Their role involves a lot of text- based coordination, they work across multiple apps, and the ROI of increased efficiency is tangible.
Iâ€™ve gone into much more detail in my post below. If you are a founder building in this area (or even just starting to think about it) please get in touch.

"As we get closer to the 2024 election, I want to reiterate my belief that Joe Biden has earned a second term through exemplary leadership in challenging times. I will be strongly supporting his re-election.
As a businessperson, I can add my voice to the bipartisan praise for â€œBidenomicsâ€. Unemployment hasnâ€™t been this low since 1954. In defiance of Wall Street critics, Bidenâ€™s team seems to have engineered the rare â€œsoft landingâ€ where inflation is coming under control, but nearly everyone who wants a job can get one. Indeed, The Economist recently reported that under Biden, America's economy has been ""astonishing"" â€” the worldâ€™s most productive, innovative, and richest.
And yes, President Biden does deserve credit. He never gave up on America. He used the bully pulpit not to attack the other party, but to turn down the temperature in national politics. That set the stage for historic bipartisan legislation to rebuild infrastructure, promote manufacturing, tackle climate, and reduce inflation. Americaâ€™s greatness set the conditions for these achievements, but Joe Bidenâ€™s leadership got them done.
Over the longer term, my businesses rely on Americaâ€™s constitutional order. We all benefit enormously from a President who defends the rule of law, here and abroad. Joe Biden stood up to his own party by calling for full funding of police at home. And he united the world against Vladimir Putinâ€™s brutal invasion of Ukraine.
Of course, I do not agree with every one of this administrationâ€™s policies. President Bidenâ€™s appointees have ranged from center-right to far-left progressives, and I have disagreed with some of their decisions. Those disagreements, however, are the sorts we are supposed to have in a vibrant democracy. Any missteps by this administration pale in comparison to the economic and societal disaster that would result from a return to the criminality and incompetence of his predecessor.",Economic Outlook

"Kudos to The Wall Street Journal for providing some much-needed clarity into the ongoing debate over drug prices in the U.S. The Journalâ€™s editors get it exactly right: market-based pricing for medicines in the U.S. enables Americans to get faster access to new treatments and incentivizes companies like Amgen to invest billions in the pursuit of even better medicines for even more diseases. Imposing price controls on drugs under the guise of Medicare â€œnegotiationâ€ wonâ€™t help patients who struggle to afford their medicines â€“ and it will threaten future innovation.

"Surprising most analysts and forecasters, employers added a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, according to this morningâ€™s monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was almost twice the growth from Decemberâ€™s 260,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.
What does this mean?
It may mean very little. The Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™s monthly report can bounce around a lot, depending on seasonal weights and samples. Next monthâ€™s job number could be far lower.
Also, keep your eye on wage growth. Average hourly earnings climbed in January at a slower pace than in December â€” by an annualized 4.4 percent, down from 4.8 percent in December. With prices still rising faster than wages, most workers continue to suffer a decline in their real wage â€“ that is, in their purchasing power.
But the strength of the labor market is likely to worry the Fed, which last Wednesday raised interest rates for the eighth time in a year â€“ although only by a quarter of a percentage point this time.
â€œThe labor market continues to be out of balance,â€ Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said earlier this week. He stressed that we wonâ€™t have a return to his target 2 percent inflation in the service sector â€œwithout a better balance in the labor market,â€ adding â€œI donâ€™t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment.â€
As Iâ€™ve said many times over the past year, this worry is misplaced. Most of the upward pressure on prices domestically is coming from big corporations with the market power to raise prices faster than their costs are rising. Much of the rest is coming from continuing supply shocks abroad, including Putinâ€™s warâ€™s effects on global energy and food prices, and Chinaâ€™s lockdowns followed by COVID.
And, as todayâ€™s report shows, wage gains are slowing and they lag behind price increases.
The basic reality is American workers donâ€™t have the power to raise their wages. Big American corporations have the power to raise their prices. The Fed should not be aiming to increase unemployment as a means of slowing prices.",Economic Outlook

"Friends,
Yesterday afternoon, President Biden met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on the debt ceiling.
Unfortunately, the meeting reinforced McCarthyâ€™s and the Republicansâ€™ message that raising the debt ceiling is a negotiable issue that should be dealt with by reducing spending.
The Washington Post described the meeting as the â€œkick off [to] talks aimed at averting a potentially catastrophic default on the national debtâ€ and â€œthe earliest stage of a messy political back-and-forth between the White House and Republicans over the federal debt ceiling.â€
Sure sounds like the start of negotiations.
Politico reported that â€œBiden officials in the run-up to the meeting privately discussed the potential for a compromise that heads off a debt ceiling crisis while separately granting McCarthy small concessions that would allow him to save face with his party.â€
Compromise? Concessions? Weâ€™re already at the negotiating table, folks.
Iâ€™ve been through several debt-ceiling crises. How theyâ€™re framed determines how the public understands whatâ€™s at stake. This framing puts the onus on Biden and the White House to negotiate.
Worse yet, the media isnâ€™t providing context. The Washington Post reports that McCarthy â€œviews the growing federal debt as the â€˜greatest threat to America,â€™â€ and Republicans â€œare determined to use talks around raising the borrowing cap to rein in the federal debt.â€
But whereâ€™s the reporting of the enormous $7.8 trillion debt racked up by Trump and his Republican Congress? Or the willingness of Republicans to raise the debt ceiling three times under Trump? Or the fact that Republican-sponsored tax cuts on big corporations and the rich substantially worsened the debt?
The White House and the Democrats must do a better job framing the debt-ceiling issue. The media must do a better job reporting on it.",MISC

"Ethical erosion is a term in the medical ethics literature that describes the loss of oneâ€™s professional values and grounding over time.
The Oxford Reference describes it as the following:
â€œAn empirically observed phenomenon whereby medical students and doctors become less morally sensitive and ethically aware due to increasing cynicism, the negative effects of health-care training and practice, and the desire to â€˜fit inâ€™ with others in the profession.""
While the term originally applied to clinicians and trainees, I believe it has broader application in healthcare. It applies to anyone and everyone in the business of caring for othersâ€”and includes behaviors like:
-mesmerizing profits and other results with indifference to the human suffering that it might does
-indifference to complaints about reasonable expectations of service quality
-normalizing abnormal activities like overly aggressively denying claims and coverage -putting necessary treatments and therapies (ie insulin) out of reach for people with co-pays
-imposing regulations to the exclusion of common sense and what is right Sometimes awareness of a term or concept leads to greater awareness of the underlying issue. Everyone who works in healthcare should commit the concept of ethical erosion to memory and monitor oneself for signs of it. Ethical erosion exists all around usâ€”every dayâ€”if you look for it. And it will take all of us operating with greater consciousness of it to limit its nefarious effects.",MISC
"Almost a decade ago, I had made the pivotal decision to leave Boston to pursue a career opportunity in California. I struggled mightily with the fact that I was leaving Boston and the East Coast and everythingâ€”and everyoneâ€”that was familiar to me. Knowing that my Dad had made a far bolder decision in the 1970s to immigrate to North America from Indiaâ€”when the only realistic form of communication between the two worlds was an occasional blue aerogrammesâ€”I called him one evening and asked him how he did it. How did he manage the emotions? He responded with words Iâ€™ll never forget:
â€œSometimes, son, you have to turn your heart to stone.â€
More dramatic words (and my Dad was not one for hyperbole) had never been spoken. Years later, he surprised me when I asked him if he would have re-immigrated to the United Statesâ€”where he had built a successful life. â€œNo, son, I gave up too much. If I had to do it all over again, I would have stayed back,â€ he said. I was shocked to say the least. My Dad always longed for more time with his family. Especially his mother and siblings. I thought about the hard lonely 3 years he spent without my brothers and mother when he first landed hereâ€”and endless immigration snafus kept them apart. The fact that he started in the US from scratchâ€”not knowing a soul. Without the money to pay for an occasional phone call home. And the courage and persistence he must have had to push forward to build a life despite it all. My heart broke for him and everyone like him. The price they wouldnâ€™t pay if they had to do it all over again. Andâ€”as we approach Thanksgivingâ€”the tremendous thanks we owe everyone who came before us for the sacrifices they made to give us a better a life.",MISC

"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. President Trumanâ€”the first presidential champion of Medicareâ€”was in attendance to witness. The program was seen at the time as a major anti-poverty program for older adults. I sometimes think about what President Truman and Johnson would think of the program that they created. This morning, Don Berwick moderated a dialog between me and Rick Gilfillan about the future of the Medicare Advantage program for the IHI Leadership Alliance. I was grateful for a respectful dialog with two mentors I admire and used the opportunity to articulate some changes that I believe will make Medicare Advantage a better program for older adults:
1) Standardized, regulated benefits - plans should compete on quality of administration, not on gimmicky benefits with low utilization rates.
2) Longer enrollment periods - annual enrollment disables a true focus on investing in chronic disease prevention and management
3) Reform of STAR rating program - high star ratings translate into higher payments to plans and higher benefits. Plans have built in disincentives to serve more complex patients and populations because higher star ratings are harder to achieve with more complex populations. 4) New methods for risk adjustment that are aligned with 2023 technologies - CMS should test machine learning models of risk adjustment that iteratively reward plans for true risk rather than expected risk. 5) More clearly articulated clinical requirements - CMS should articulate stronger clincial guidelines around accesss to care to ensure that no corners are caught in the care of patients.
Critics of Medicare Advantare would have us throw the baby out with bath water. Itâ€™s a complicated program with good actors and bad actorsâ€”and unintended consequences. Like every single other health policy. That said, it provides an incredible amount of security to older adults who are on a fixed incomeâ€”hence its popularity. Traditional Medicare pushes a sizable cost share on to older adults (whose average pretax income is $48,000) who are often unable to bear the expense of copays (20% of most office visits and $1600 for any hospitalization). Traditional Medicare requires literal acts of Congress (Congress!) to introduce new benefits. There was no prescription drug coverage until 2004 (2004!). There is still no vision, dental, or hearing coverage in traditional Medicare. ACOs may lower total costs of care but they do little to lower costs for beneficiary-save reducing their utilization of services some. President Truman and President Johnson wanted a Medicare program that gave older adults financial security and health coverage in their Golden years. Letâ€™s keep working to build a better Medicare program and give them that.",Health Insurance
"Fifty years ago, my Dadâ€”aggrieved and heartbroken at the sudden, untimely loss of his own fatherâ€”made an emotional decision to the United States to train further in medicine. His plan when he came hereâ€”like many of his generationâ€”was to gain expertise and return to India.
God had other plans for himâ€”and he built a life here.
And what a life it was.
His sacrifices treated us all to an amazing journeyâ€”lacking for nothingâ€”unlike even he could imagine when he made his fateful decision to leave India.
Kind, strong, industrious, stubborn, creative, innovative, entrepreneurial, persistentâ€”Dad scaled the heights of his profession, built incredible community, and was the patriarch of a family and community of friends that loved him immeasurably. Everyone who met my Dad would come away with a memorable earnest story, a piece of advice, or word of encouragement.
My Dad loved helping peopleâ€”patients, family members, neighbors, strangersâ€”and if there was some way he could lend a hand to comfort another soul, he would extend himself (and sometimes my mom) without hesitation or reservation. Love for others and community and generosity defined him. My Dad loved my Mom dearlyâ€”though he would almost never say it. A quiet understanding between two people who had spent a lifetime taking on every challenge life presented them. And there were many. Married for 56 yearsâ€”they were best friends and partners and navigated whatever came their way. Together, they were towering examples to us and raised me and my brothers with a sense of family and culture that was their greatest pride. He treated my bhabhis Archana and Sapna and my wife Jennifer as the daughters he never had. And he rejoiced in stories of the lives of his grandchildrenâ€”taking intimate interest in their educations, careers, and matrimonial prospects.
As yesterday unfolded, a haunting fear overcame me was that I would forget himâ€”the little things, the big things, the small gestures and stories. All the things that we dismissed and took for granted as just â€œDad being Dad,â€ but suddenly were so ripe with meaning and significance and emotion.
His easy smile as he told one of his countless war stories.
The satisfied look on his face when we consumed a Mirchi Badda.
How he loved buying the exact same pair of glasses and shoes every yearâ€”thinking they were a new style.
The protective way he stayed up at night waiting for us to returnâ€”to make sure we are okâ€”from a night out even at age 43.
His exemplary unconditional love for his brothers and sisters and their families.
All the Marwari sayings he taught us to convey wisdom.
His unwavering faith in Gurudev Shanti Vijayaji Maharaj and his belief that Gurudev would make everything ok.
But as the day unfoldedâ€”and we were surrounded by the global community of people who loved himâ€”I am certain that his unquenchable, unforgettable, warrior spirit will live on in all of us.

"Could the whole Medicare program use a reboot?
Yes.
Thatâ€™s the argument I made at Health Evolution Summit alongside Andy Slavitt (Town Hall Ventures); Karen Ignagni (EmblemHealth) and Richard Merkin (Heritage Provider Network).
â€œI think we have to think differently about this program and how it can actually serve the needs of older adults. When you think about where the program started and where we are today, we havenâ€™t made the kind of leaps in the organization and structure and delivery of care as we have in clinical science. And in the same time that weâ€™re talking about CRISPR and gene editing, weâ€™re also still talking about fee-for-service Medicare and whether it covers vision services.

"I shared my thoughts on the state of the healthcare industry with David Raths.
On the Medicare Advantage v. FFS Medicare
The truth is that we've failed on some level. The way I know that we've failed is that we've been engaged in the zero-sum debates about whether Medicare Advantage is better or fee-for-service Medicare is better. I would say if our industry had done its job, we would have settled those debates a decade ago. When we used to talk about the move to value, we talked about your feet being in multiple canoes moving in different directions. Now we've got 10 boats and we've got for only two feet and two arms, and we're trying to be in all boats. And some organizations are finding themselves falling into the water as a result, because there are so many different payment programs that have slightly different rules, incentives and models. We talk a lot about harmonizing benefits, but it doesn't really work that way.
On Biopharma Innovation and the Limitations of Annual Enrollment
I used to work at Merck, and I think about all my former biotech colleagues and pharma colleagues, who are inventing truly amazing things, but they're expensive. The total lifetime cost for someone with severe sickle cell disease is in the millions of dollars because of all the pain crises and the hospital admissions that these folks experience. If you know a patient with bad sickle cell disease is bouncing to and from the hospital and emergency room, and you have a cure that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to administer, you want to be able to pay for that and know that there's going to be some return on it. But unfortunately, I can cure you tomorrow, pay for your cure, and then next year, you can switch insurance or jobs and switch insurance. So there's a natural resistance within the system to funding things that have longer payback periods.
On Inauthenticity
â€œOne observation is that I think we have normalized inauthenticity. We talk about changing lives and we talk about improving lives and commitment to community and being better and supporting people and then you look at some of our industry's actions: we're putting people in a medical debt we talk about the benefits for social determinants of health, but then we put real barriers in front of people to actually access those benefits.
I think we've normalized inauthenticity. We make ourselves feel better to some extent by talking about all the small things that we do to make a small number of people's lives better, but the reality is that we've participated in complexifying the U.S. healthcare system to the point where we've eroded trust with people and communities, and I think it's time to turn it around.â€",Health outcomes

"On Monday, March 6, Sylvia Lopez, whoâ€™s a Care Manager at SCAN called a member Iâ€™ll call MaryAnn.
MaryAnn was a new member. She is dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and so she recently enrolled in our Connections plan.
Sylvia thought sheâ€™d be doing a quick, routine health assessment.
Well, hereâ€™s what Sylvia quickly learned:
â€¢ MaryAnn is 81 years old.
â€¢ She experiences forgetfulness and has uncontrolled pain in her ankles, knees and back. Sheâ€™s got other ailments including hypertension, and incontinence.
â€¢ She fell out of her bed recently.
â€¢ She canâ€™t really take care of herself anymore. She canâ€™t cook or clean her apartment.
â€¢ MaryAnn also lives alone. Her daughter used to care for her, but her daughter passed away from COVID.
In addition, MaryAnn was hungry.
Remember, Sylvia called her on a Monday. MaryAnn hadnâ€™t had a meal since the preceding Friday.
She was signed up with Meals on Wheels, but the portions were small and her next delivery wasnâ€™t due until the next day.
MaryAnn couldnâ€™t go to the local supermarket. A taxi would cost her $20, and she didnâ€™t have the money, since sheâ€™d used it to take a taxi to her last doctorâ€™s appointment.
She had half a jar of peanut butter in her house, and she was rationing 2 tablespoons of peanut butter every 3-4 hours. 2 tablespoons. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. Imagine that.
So hereâ€™s where Sylvia stepped in. First, she got her authorization for Chronic Condition meals so sheâ€™d have food right away.
Her independent living benefit wasnâ€™t due to kick in until April 1, but she was hungry, so the SCAN team didnâ€™t waste any time approving her for immediate food delivery.
Then, Sylvia called Meals on Wheels America to make sure the delivery would be made the next day.
She also explained to MaryAnn that as a SCAN member she had a transportation benefit, which she could use to get to the doctor and the supermarket.
And then, the next day, Sylvia called MaryAnn again. She made sure she sheâ€™d gotten her meals.
She went over how to arrange transportation.
She told her SCAN would be sending her extra meals for as long as she needed them.
In addition, she got MaryAnn incontinence supplies and a SCAN Personal Emergency Response System so she can call for help if she falls or if she needs medical help.
She also helped arrange for a caregiver to come to MaryAnnâ€™s home three times a week to assist her with personal care and homemaking.
At the end of Sylviaâ€™s and MaryAnnâ€™s call, MaryAnn told Sylvia sheâ€™d had a dream the night after they spoke. â€œIn the dream, an angel came to me,â€ MaryAnn told Sylvia. â€œAnd the angel was you.â€
We often talk about models to address the needs of complex patients.
What we donâ€™t talk about is the incredible empathy, passion, and dedication required to serve these patients day-in, day-out.
Thank you, Sylvia!",MISC
"Now that the Medicare Advantage advanced rate notice is behind us and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has finalized its rates, I want to share my perspective that competition is broken in Medicare Advantage.

Each year, plans add and subtract benefits creating massive confusion for beneficiaries and herd-like movements to the plans with the most â€œattractiveâ€ benefits. Older adults are often dazed and confusedâ€”unsure of what to do year after year.

What plans must do (and traditional FFS Medicare for that matter) is align their programs and benefits with the distinctive healthcare needs of older adults.

And what the MA industry must do once and for all is demonstrate real, not marginal, superiority to traditional fee for service Medicare.

Competition should be focused on the excellence demonstrated meeting those needsâ€”NOT just which plans offer the best benefits.

Thatâ€™s why my latest Forbes column argues for standardized benefits in Medicare Advantage and measured excellence in the inflection points in the lives of older adults that are aligned with health risk and potential poor outcomes.

1) plan response to a first-fall or hip fracture
2) a new cancer diagnosis
3) the transition from palliative care to hospice
4) the death of a spouse (h/t to Varun Kumar, MD)

Among othersâ€¦

CMSâ€”because of legislation introduced by Senator Ron Wyden when he was an early -career Congressman-operates standardized benefits for Medicare supplemental policies. It could do the same for people suffering from particular conditions in Medicare Advantage.

There are many details to be worked out - but the next generation of Medicare Advantage plans should compete on excellence in health outcomes - and nothing else.

He's since had a distinguished and highly successful career as an academic physician at Penn Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Health System; vice-chair at Medicare Payment Advisory Commission; and also as founder of Embedded Health (now Clarify Health Solutions).

"I was excited to join Vivien Ho on her Pear VC podcast.
We had a wide-ranging conversation on SCAN and the future of the healthcare industry.
Some snippets from our dialog:
â€œOne of the biggest problems we have in healthcare is that most healthcare entrepreneurs donâ€™t need healthcare and donâ€™t realize how dystopic some of the things that theyâ€™re creating areâ€” until they actually need them on the other side of things.â€
â€œI think we have an authenticity problem in healthcare. Everyone starts out with the greatest intent to drive the most change, and then before long, the pressures start to circulate around you and youâ€™re just trying to survive, and then you build something thatâ€™s just as mediocre as the things that youâ€™re trying to replace.â€
â€œWeâ€™ve normalized the abnormal in the Medicare Advantage industry, and we've normalized the abnormal in health care more broadly. The opportunity for us is to try to simplify things on behalf of seniors.â€

"Two days ago, a woman approached me as I was taking out the trash. She introduced herself as the sister of my next door neighbor.
Neighborâ€™s sister: â€œI understand that you are the president of SCAN.â€
Me: â€œUhm, yes.â€ I was nervous about where this might go. Conversations starting out this way mostly go very well but occasionally go sideways fast.
Neighborâ€™s sister: â€œAre you guys in Arizona?â€
Me: â€œYes, we have been in Arizona for two years now. In Phoenix and Tucson. Why do you ask?â€
Neighborâ€™s sister: â€œYour Embrace team has done an amazing job with my husband. He has dementia and lives in a memory care unit and the weekly visits from Liz, the nurse practitioner, give me a lot of comfort and support. Heâ€™s declining. I donâ€™t want to move anywhere that you guys arenâ€™t. Are you in Northern California?â€
(Embrace is our institutional special needs plan [ISNP] for home and institution bound patients)
Sometimes we all doubt whether we are making a difference. Whether the words we say and the programs we build truly translate into the difference we set out to make.
When we launched our ISNP two years ago, our teams (led initially by Payam Parvinchiha, MD, MPH, Lisa Hildreth, Benjamin Ware, MD, Alyssa Rios and other great leadersâ€”and now also by Gabe Waterman, MD, MBA, Daniel Croymans, MD, MBA, Sheerali Patel PharmD, BCPS) set out to build something special and different that provided direct care to members with the highest clinical care.
We are deliberately hard on ourselves and need to be even harder on the path to clinical excellence. We have grown quickly and occasionally stumbled. We continue to feel instinctively that we can be even better.
But this random interaction affirmed that we are on path to build and scale a clinical model of care to which every home and institution-bound older adult should have access.
The fact that even one person was making a life decision as profound as moving based on the presence of our health plan and our clinical teamsâ€”was as gratifying a feeling as I have had in a long time.
It was also a reminder that critics of Medicare Advantage often donâ€™t see some of the unique innovations that are enabled by prepayment.
Every Embrace patient has access to:
1) an employed nurse practitioner and primary care doctor who visits them on the home on a regular basis (sometimes weekly or daily if necessary)
2) a case manager and/or social worker who facilitates transitions of care and ensures that frail and demented patients donâ€™t spend more time than they need to in hospitals
3) a pharmacist who works consistently to identify opportunities to optimize their medication regimens
4) on-site, in-home diagnostics and specialist consultations to help avoid confusing, unnecessary visits to medical care settings.
Itâ€™s hard to understand the difference programs like this make until you see them in action.
Or until your neighborâ€™s sister says she isnâ€™t going to move to a geography where your plan doesnâ€™t exist.",Health outcomes
"Thereâ€™s lots of talk about the expected shortage of healthcare workers in the United States.
The sources of this shortage are threefold:
1) need is growing because of the aging population;
2) many healthcare workers are leaving the workforce voluntarily or are retiring; and
3) we are not producing enough new healthcare workers to replace the ones who are leaving or retiring.
The projected US healthcare workforce shortage was anticipated as early as 15 years ago and has always struck me as odd. As a country, the United States has more healthcare workers per capita than most other like nations.
I am reminded that how we define a problem influences how we solve that problemâ€”and I would argue that addressing our workforce shortage requires a much bigger reimagination than simply producing more of the same types of healthcare workers.
Some thoughts on solutions:
1) Unlock the latent skill of all healthcare professionals: many healthcare professions are defined by â€œscope of practiceâ€ rules that say what they can and can not do. We need to rethink who does what and in what situations. Pharmacists, for example, are a highly trained and empowered group of clinicians who can do more to help manage the burden of chronic disease than they are empowered to do. Instead, arcane laws and regulations hold back their impact.
2) Reimagine the healthcare team: much â€œscope of practiceâ€ dialog is about replacing one type of healthcare worker with another. Rather, we should be thinking about engineering true interprofessional teams that have robust supervision models, escalation protocols, and support so that outcomes and care are owned by groups of people whose collective capacity is greater than the sum of their individual capacity (1+1=3). This isnâ€™t about replacing doctors with nurse practioners (as it has been in so many settings) but positioning people to collaborate to ensure sound clinical care.
3) Eliminate useless, non-value added work and tasks: there is so much non-value added work in healthcare. Tons of it. There has been talk for 3 decades about eliminating that non-value added workâ€”yet it continues to layer upon itself. Start with documentation. We are literally crushing ourselves underneath the burden of documentation and administrative exercises that are tangentially related to clinical care. Time to start calling it what it is.
4) Drive consumption of less healthcare: much healthcare that is consumed is not valuable for patients. We have an â€œoveruseâ€ problem in US healthcare wherein people are getting services that they donâ€™t necessarily need. We could free up a lot of clinical capacity if we began to commit to scaling back on the kinds of services that provide little real benefit to patients.

"It was thrilling that Nasdaq today shared the news about SCANâ€™s planned combination with CareOregon and the formation of the HealthRight Group on its iconic Times Square billboard.
The underlying intent of the combination is simple:
To improve care for frail and vulnerable populations of all kinds.

SCANâ€™s strength is in the Medicare program, where we have 6 years straight of 4.5 Star performance (a feat accomplished by only 2 other plans in the country).
CareOregonâ€™s strength is in the Medicaid program where it has received national accolades for its patient-centered approach to serving the physical and behavioral health needs of people that society has too often forgotten.
Together, HealthRight will exceed $6.8B in revenues and 3000 employees and serve more than 800,000 people.

"In honor of Pride Month, Jill Selby and I reflected on our experience launching the industryâ€™s first LGBTQ+ focused Medicare Advantage plan: SCAN Affirm.
â€œTo be clear, weâ€™ve experienced backlash from both within and outside our organization. A number of members posted derogatory comments on our social media pages. Some of our own employees wrote anti-gay slurs on our internal website. A medical group with whom weâ€™d long partneredâ€”and which had long been treating members who switched to Affirmâ€”declined to specifically serve our Affirm members.

"I was honored to be named to Pearl Healthâ€™s Top 50 value-based care thinkers of 2023 list.
I largely believe that â€œvalue-basedâ€ care has so far failed to live up to its high promise.
Most value-based care is focused on shifting dollars and risk from one group of people to another (largely from health plans to provider groups or health systems).
There has been little emphasis on truly taking cost out of the system and lowering total cost of care for society.
True value-based care will:
1) invest more in comprehensive outpatient services (primary, speciality, and behavioral healthcare) to reduce avoidable, costly inpatient spending.
2) consider and optimize long-term health and healthcare expenditure (thinking 10-15 years at a time, not 1 year at a time). While some programs like Medicare Advantage encourage this longer-term view because of low-disenrollment rates, this likely requires a redesign of the insurance model (think 3-year plan enrollment).
3) align incentives for all members of the medical group (primary care physicians and specialists) while also encouraging productivity - a very hard trick to pull off.
4) return savings to society (government and all payers) by reducing non-productive spend in healthcare (who in healthcare sees their particular bucket of spending as non-productive?). Could we, for instance, target US healthcare spending at 15% of GDP? We are at 18.3% right now.
5) improve quality and reduce medical spending by changing the care experienceâ€”not just capture more revenue (i.e. through coding). So much that has been hailed as â€œvalue-basedâ€ care has been â€œhigher revenueâ€ care.
â€œValue-basedâ€ care has become the catch-all term that summarizes the hopes and dreams of a generation of healthcare leaders.
Letâ€™s make those dream really come to life by acknowledging how far we have to go and feeling collectively accountable for delivering on that promise.",MISC

"Earlier this week, my family acknowledged the 30th anniversary of the untimely death of my visionary aunt, Dr. Shanti Jain.
When I was 12 years old, I quietly watched Shanti Auntie take her last breaths. We shared a train cabin as we traversed the deserts of Rajasthan, India. She awakened in the middle of the night gasping for air, struggling. My parents awakened alongside her and searched for help, for a tank of oxygen. Abruptly, the gasping stopped. I called out to ask if she was okay. ""Is she dead?"" I asked innocently. There was no response. Brief sobs and then quiet. The train rolled on in the darkness.
Before writing these words, I had not shared the experience of witnessing my aunt's death. Death is one of those subjects that is almost always fumbled. If we discuss it at length, we run the risk of dwelling on a moment beyond its useful life. If we maintain our silence, the accompanying loss can haunt us for a lifetime. There were many remarkable things about the moments leading up to and following my aunt's death.
Perhaps most personally impactful was my aunt's decisive role in establishing my career path. As we waited to board the train, my aunt, carrying the burden of a new diagnosis of stage IV ovarian cancer, asked me if I would become a doctor, like her. I told her I wasn't sure. Sitting in the wheelchair loaded with chemotherapy, I could not deny her. I promised her that I would. And while I fought my promise in the years following--I always returned to it--until it was fulfilledâ€”with her as my inspiration.
The bitterly ironic circumstances of my aunt's death still confound me. Shanti Auntie had spent most of her life fighting to give rural populations access to health care. When it mattered most, she lacked access to good health care herself. The symptoms of her ovarian cancer, a notoriously insidious killer, were misdiagnosed over and over again. By the time she had the definitive imaging, her CT scan was alight with cancer.
Perhaps most remarkable--and most heartening--was the response of the family and friends who cared about her most. My aunt was not a famous doctor by any stretch of the imagination. Yet she was a giant in the lives of people who were touched by her grace and big personality. After her death, her brothers and sisters resolved to make her life--and deathâ€”count. One by one, they took up the causes that mattered to her most. In the years following her loss, we have collectively worked to improve health care in the small villages (Phalodi and Khichan) where she lived and served. And my own career, inspired by her example, has focused on making healthcare just a bit better.
Ryan Holiday has written that the ""obstacle is the way.""
That which obstructs our progress.
That which stands in our way can also propel us forward.
Coping with loss is never easy, but it is in managing through it that we can find the future and sometimes, even, ourselves.",MISC
"For as long as Iâ€™ve worked in the industry, thereâ€™s been a belief that consumerism would fix all that ails American healthcare.
Consumerismâ€™s strong proponents believe that patientsâ€”operating more like shoppers for other goods and servicesâ€”will unleash the power of competition to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
There are a number of reasons that consumerism has failed that go largely undiscussed:
The Market For Clinical Care Is Inelastic
In other markets for goods and services, new entrants join the market when thereâ€™s an opportunity. In the United States, the supply of clinicians is largely inelastic because of our system of regulating healthcare professionals. The number of medical school, residency, and fellowship positions is largely fixed and not particularly dynamic. It takes, for example, 10 years to produce a new gastroenterologist (4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 3 years of fellowship). If we really wanted to test the idea that competition could improve outcomes and lower costsâ€”we might open our borders to physicians from other countries and not require them to retrain in the US system (as the state of Tennesse is now doing) or expand allowable scope of practice between disciplines of medicine.
Consolidation & Poor Anti-Trust Enforcement
All segments of healthcare have undergone massive consolidation in the last 20 years. Communities that previously had choices of 5-6 hospitals now have 1 large health system in its place. Physicians who previously practiced independently are now parts of big health systems. These systems exist to elevate selling power with payers and keep prices high. Health plans, for their part, have done the same thing and consolidated as wellâ€”and patients in some markets have many fewer choices than they once had of plans, hospitals, and medical groups. A functioning market requires lots of players in order for prices to move elastically.
There Are Massive Information Assymetries
In order to have a functioning market for healthcare goods and services, patients need information about the quality of services they are purchasing. Unfortunately, such information is mixed in quality. Why? Quality measures capture only a small fraction of the clinical scenarios that are relevant to patients. There are literally 100,000s of different clincial scenarios and it is near impossible to measure the skill/capability of a clinician or health system at managing all of these clinical scenarios. Averages may/may not be helpful fo patients in understanding whether a clinician or health system is best at managing their particular scenarios. While there have been efforts to introduce greater transparency, these efforts are surface level at bestâ€”not for lack of effort, but because it is so complex. And there remains more art than science in many clinical scenarious making defining a â€œgold standardâ€ very difficult.

"The question of merit and who deserves what is a very complicated one that we are grappling with as a society. With an increasing focus on diversity in many domains, backlash sometimes focuses on the departure from â€œpure merit.â€
Usual arguments for â€œpure meritâ€ include some measure of test scores, academic performance, previous experiences, publications, etc. But those of us who have been involved in selection processes for academic programs or jobs need to fess up. Pure merit is always contextual. And context is incredibly hard to measure and imperfect.
And because of context is hard to measureâ€”we often take shortcuts. We look at the schools from which someone graduated. The names of the companies on someoneâ€™s resume. A recommendation from a someone we know. We see these as proxy measures for merit. But they are imperfect at best.
And time and time again, unless prompted to do otherwise by force or by circumstance, it is human nature to always seek and select the familiar. To apply proxies for merit instead of doing the hard, imperfect work to see if someone who comes in a different package from the one we know is capable of success. Which is to sayâ€”whatever the changing and sometimes unjust law of the landâ€”we must constantly contend with the imperfections of our judgment. To try to be fair to everyone. To create and give opportunity to people whose merit may come in unfamiliar forms.

"Over the last decade, Iâ€™ve witnessed a lot of folks (including myself) make avoidable career mistakes ignoring clear warning signs that a role would not be a good fit.
In my observation, mismatches typically happen across all industries and job functions for a few clear reasons.
1) Blissful ignorance, exceptionalism, or hubris: knowing that a situation is suspect (sus, as the kids say), but engaging in self-delusion that â€œI will be different.â€ Too many people ignore warnings (about a bad structural situation or a bad boss) because they believe they will be different than people who came before them.
2) Goal mesmerization: Many people get very fixated on becoming a director, VP, SVP, EVP, CXO, CEO, or â€œP and L responsibility.â€ When they get so fixated, they are blind to everything else that may not be right about a job. And so the promotion becomes a fixation independent of whether the situation is intrinsically good/bad.
3) Compensation: many people blindly choose an opportunity because a big pay bump, skipping the requisite step of deeply assessing whether a situation is good or bad for them and then career.
4) Prestige: the call from the highly acclaimed firm or big name person validates us and makes us feel momentarily special. But prestige and reputation arenâ€™t always correlated with successâ€”and, like compensation, can be blinding.
5) Laziness/complacency: when we make career moves, we need to seek every available piece of information to inform our decisions. But we often skip stepsâ€”and donâ€™t ask the questions we need to because we â€œtrust our gutâ€ more than â€œdoing our homework. Even â€œour gutâ€ needs information to guide how it feels.
6) Lack of self-awareness: knowing ourselves is so important to making good career decisions. And many people donâ€™t take the time to askâ€”is this role, level, company, situation, or industry really a good fit for me. What are my own strengths and weaknesses? Confronting our own brutal truths is unnatural for manyâ€”but nonetheless necessary.
7) Running from, not running to: Many of the worst career mistakes Iâ€™ve witnessed have involved the primary motivating factor being running away from a bad situation rather than running â€œtoâ€ a good situation. The grass isnâ€™t always greener and we arenâ€™t always in the best mindset to make a good decision when we are running from something.
8) Excessive trust: a recruiter or a new boss sells us hard on something (they are just doing their jobs) - and we buy it hook, line, and sinker without asking enough questions. This is another version of â€œlaziness/complacency.â€

"In January 2016, Leeba Lessin offered me the opportunity to succeed her as the leader of CareMore Health. As part of the transition, she and I visited many of the companyâ€™s markets and clinics. She wanted to say goodbye to as many people as she could, but (I realized after the fact) she also wanted to give me some final leadership tutoring as part of the transition. I will never forget our final visit to the Upland Care Center.
Moments after walking into the clinic, Leeba warmly greeted the receptionist and the gave her a big hug. The receptionist didnâ€™t waste the moment to ask for something that had been on her mind for awhile. She asked Leeba if they might be able to get a fish tank for the waiting room. She shared how much she and the patients would enjoy the calming effect of an aquarium.
â€œSure!!!!â€ Leeba said with booming, obvious enthusiasm. â€œWhat a great idea!â€ In the moment, she went ahead and emailed our facilities leader and asked him to have a fish tank installed that week.
I was a little bit shocked (and as a lifetime aquarium hobbyist, excited). I was used to leaders doing a bit of what my parents did when I asked for a new toy saying something like, â€œIâ€™ll think about it.â€ I was also used to leaders instinctively hiding behind cost management. But Leeba not only made a quick decisionâ€”she set in motion fulfilling the request. Leeba noticed the suprise on my face.
In that moment, she pulled me aside and whispered an important leadership lesson: Saying yes to a modest request like â€œcan we have a fish tank,â€ is the fastest way to make people believe that they matter and one of the fastest ways to foster a culture of ownership and empowerment and belonging. The fish tank arrived later that week and Leeba and I were treated to a picture of the staff with the tank. It was a very small gesture, but it was clearly huge to the employees of that clinic.
A finance or accounting mindset in that moment would have led to a careful evaluation of the cost of the fish tank and the monthly maintenance and effect on run rate. An operations or risk management mindset would have led to an assessment of whether if we did it for one clinic we needed to do it for all clinics. And in both approaches, the answer would have been â€œno fish tank.â€ But what Leeba taught me was that a leadership mindset leads to an instinctive â€œyes,â€ and quick action on what was (in the grand scheme of things) a very small request.
Since that time Iâ€™ve said yes to many metaphorical â€œfish tanksâ€ where I might otherwise have said â€œnoâ€ or â€œmaybeâ€ or â€œlaterâ€ or â€œit depends.â€ And I have to say, it does feel really good to deliver an enthusiastic, unmitigated â€œyes!â€ from time to time.
As many of you know, Leeba Lessin passed away a little bit more than two years ago. But Iâ€™m reminded of the pearls of wisdom she shared along the way and relish in how lucky I was to learn from one of the true greats.

"Several years ago, I decided to take a two-week vacation after not having taken one for two years and two months in a new role.
About a week into my vacation, I received a phone call from my boss who wasnâ€™t usually interested in details like my holiday schedule.
Boss: Sachin, people are saying you are on a really long vacation and that things arenâ€™t getting done because theyâ€™d like your input before they move forward. Maybe you shouldnâ€™t take as long a vacation next timeâ€¦
Me: I was speechless and I was fuming. â€œI havenâ€™t taken a vacation in two yearsâ€¦Who were these people?â€
Boss: I canâ€™t say. But maybe you shouldâ€¦
Me: Well-if you canâ€™t say, then tell this â€œpersonâ€ or â€œpeopleâ€ to mind their own business.
Boss. Just make sure things can keep going in your absence.
Me: I havenâ€™t taken a vacation in more than 2 years. Whoever you are talking to didnâ€™t know and/or omitted that important detail from your conversation. They can mind their own business.
Boss: Just make sure things keep moving while you are out. Take it easy.
I hung up the phone. It occured to me that I knew exactly who the person was.
Ahhhhhâ€¦.So many things were wrong with this situation.
1) I learned that the issue that was raised was not actually an important / urgent one. It could wait for me to return. It was just urgent for that person in that momentâ€”but actually wasnâ€™t that important.
2) My colleague has complained that I was on a vacationâ€”not to meâ€”but to my boss. What prevented her from reaching out to me if she really needed my input? It was an extreme form of passive aggressiveness. I would never trust that colleague again.
3) Little value was given to me and the fact that I hadnâ€™t taken a vacation in my whole time in my new role. I thought I was being heroic not taking my vacationsâ€”but no one noticed and, in fact, presumed the opposite when I did elect to take one. That i was reckless about taking my vacation. When I hadnâ€™t taken a single day off in two years!
4) There was little concern about actually bothering me on my vacationâ€”which now felt somewhat ruined by my colleague and my boss (given especially that I remember this call years and years later)
I always think about that call from my boss when I sometimes feel compelled to call a colleague on vacation. It almost certainly can wait. And I never make the call.
And I always think about how often no one notices when youâ€™re grinding away for a company or cause.
Take your vacations. Donâ€™t be a martyr. Almost no one notices your martyrdom.
And I always remember it when someone whispers a complaint about a colleague rather than first directing the issue to the personâ€”always says more about the person than the real issue at hand. Itâ€™s a good signal that thereâ€™s a nefarious cultural cancer in your midst.",MISC
"It is awards season SCAN and we couldnâ€™t be more proud to share that the news that we were named #26 of 75 workplaces named to the Modern Healthcare Best Places to Work. This is the first time in our 46 year history that we were named to this list. The list is produced based on employee survey data. Iâ€™m particularly proud of this award as it was achieved as we have grown considerably (to 1700 employees and nearly $5b in revenue with more than 300,000 people served in 4 states) and driven significant innovation in our delivery model.
Just last week, SCAN was named one of Modern Healthcareâ€™s Top Innovator Organizafions in the first year that the publication named organizations to this list. We were acknowledged for our efforts to sustain non-profit healthcare (and our proposed combination with CareOregon); our Affirm product serving the LGBTQ+ population older adults (the first of its kind in US healthcare); and our creation of Healthcare in Action, our medical group focused on people experiencing homelessness. The latter is gratifying as it reflects a personal passion since my earliest days as an undergraduate student and addresses an area of deep unmet need in the community and work by an incredible team making a big difference. In the coming days, we will share even more new innovations and â€œfirstsâ€ from SCAN focused on helping us achieve our mission of keeping seniors healthy and independent.
This recognition follows SCAN being named the #1 Medicare Advantage plan in California by JD Powers and Associates in a survey of our members. This latter recognition is what is is all aboutâ€”recognition by the people we serve. Our Board of Directors (pictured) and our leadership team (pictured) have always been defined by our member focusâ€”and keeping their needs at the center of everything we do.
This is all to say - we are a winning team! I encourage those of you who are interested in joining us to review open positions on our website or reach out to any of our leaders (including Cynthia (Crowder) Bryant SHRM-SCP, SPHRâ€”our director of Talent Strategy whose team always wants to be in touch with difference-makers).

"Tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of the publication of â€œLean In.â€
In that decade, weâ€™ve cycled through a lot of excitement, a lot of confidence, a lot of asking for raises, a lot of exhausting work, a lot of leaning in â€” all leading to some pretty mixed results. At best.
There have been a couple â€œtwo steps forwardâ€ moments since then: The share of women CEOs in the S&P 500 in 2012 was an abysmal 4%. Today itâ€™s a better â€” but still way-too-low â€” 8.2%.
There have been a fair share of â€œno steps forward,â€ too: The gender pay gap was $0.82 to a white manâ€™s dollar in 2013; itâ€™s $0.82 today.
The share of venture funding that went to women CEOs was 2.7% in 2011-2013; itâ€™s 2% today.
As for mandated paid parental leave in the US: We didnâ€™t have it then, and we donâ€™t have it now.
And then there were the heartbreaking â€œmultiple steps back.â€ The reversal of womenâ€™s reproductive rights. The pandemic, during which so much of the financial and familial pressure was borne by women. And the loss of the optimism and sense of progress and inevitability that came with TimesUp and the Womenâ€™s March, both of which have since folded or faltered.
Overall, not a great decade for women. Frankly, itâ€™s been exhausting.
Iâ€™m all for working hard and advocating for yourself. But my best career advice to the women who made â€œLean Inâ€ such a bestseller canâ€™t be found anywhere in the pages of the book:
Itâ€™s to invest.
Gloria Steinem has noted that a missed opportunity of the feminist movement of the 1970s was their failure to consider wealth-building as a major goal. Itâ€™s not a real stretch to imagine how different â€” and how much richer, in all senses of the word â€” we would be, individually and collectively, if women had more wealth.
And investing has historically been a means to build wealth â€” whereas oneâ€™s salary has not.
$1 invested in Nasdaq in 2013 is now $4.04.*
And investing takes a lot less work than leaning in ever did.
As we say at Ellevest, the best time to start investing is yesterday â€” and with us having so far yet to go, the 10th anniversary of â€œLean Inâ€ is as good a moment as any to get to fixing that.

"Divorce changes pretty much everything. Whether itâ€™s a surprise or something youâ€™re both on board with, youâ€™ve gone from a â€œweâ€ to a â€œme"" â€” and that can take some getting used to.
Maybe you were involved in the family finances while you were married, or maybe not. Either way, now the checkbook is in your hands. And that checkbook may look different than what you expected.
Why? Frustratingly, research shows that womenâ€™s household income falls almost twice as much as menâ€™s post-split. And divorce can affect womenâ€™s money in a lot of other ways, too.
Thatâ€™s a lot. And dealing with it is also pretty urgent. Financial instability is stressful and disruptive (especially if youâ€™re in a pretty emotional place right now).

"My best friend Laura died in an accident on International Women's Day, 21 yrs ago. I post this every March 8 in honor of her, and all the women around the world who uplift, support and encourage the highest good in all of us. Laura was my roommate in Atlanta and when she died I started Spanx in her empty bedroom. The Spanx HQ was actually her bedroom in our apartment for the first three years until I could afford to move the HQ out of our apartment. Laura was a total free spirit. She took trapeze in college, was always playing the guitar and was an adored school teacher. She would always say, ""Blakely, you're going to change the world one day."" And I would say, ""Laura, I sell fax machines."" And she would fall back on the bed, smile and say, ""I know, but it's your destiny.""
Somehow she knew something greater was in store for me. So it felt like no accident that she died on International Women's Day. It was like she was sending me a final wink about my destiny. Fast forward 10 years... March 7th, 2012. I'm on the cover of Forbes. I was living in NYC the day the article came out. 15 minutes after the article went live on the internet, my doorbell rang. It was a flower delivery. I was sure someone was congratulating me on my first Forbes cover. I opened the card .. and it said ""Thinking of you, Love Laura."" My dear friend Devon Baranski sends me flowers from Laura every year on the anniversary of her death, March 8th, to honor her memory. But it was March 7th... I was confused. I called the florist and they said, ""Omg, we are so sorry. It was scheduled for March 8th but the driver accidentally took it out a day early."" I dropped to my knees and cried. It was no accident. Laura was the first to congratulate me. She was simply saying, ""I told you so."" Wishing women everywhere a happy International Womenâ€™s Day. May the world lift up women, may we lift each other up, and may we see and encourage the potential in each other, maybe even before we see it in ourselves. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2023

"Happy National 401(k) Day! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ On this important day, Iâ€™m reminded of the significant number of Americans who donâ€™t yet have access to a 401(k) â€” a 2023 report from Pew Charitable Trust found that over 56 million privately-employed Americans lack access to retirement savings programs through their jobs. ðŸ‘·â€â™‚ï¸ ðŸ‘·â€â™€ï¸
Itâ€™s critical that we help set more people on the path toward retirement security â€” at Betterment at Work, weâ€™re focused on increasing access to 401(k)s at small and midsize businesses across America.
A survey ðŸ” we conducted last year uncovered that a 401(k) is the most desired financial wellness benefit, followed closely by an employer 401(k) matching program. However, we also found that 34% of employees arenâ€™t aware of all the benefits their employer offers, havenâ€™t gotten around to signing up for them or donâ€™t know how to do so. ðŸ˜•
Employers: take today to ensure that youâ€™re supporting your employees on their path to retirement security as best you can â€” whether that means helping your employees sign up or encouraging them to increase their contribution rate, researching providers that offer better plans, or looking into offering a 401(k) for the first time. ðŸ’¸
While it used to be time-consuming and expensive for small and midsize businesses to offer a 401(k), there are now high quality and cost effective solutions on the market that make it incredibly simple â€” while helping your business stand apart from the pack.

â€œIn terms of selecting the best course of radiation treatment post mastectomy, the results of the first-of-its-kind, FABREC study were just presented at ASTRO. This was a randomized comparison across multiple institutions of standard fractionation (25) versus shorter course (16) in the post mastectomy setting. With an average follow up for five years, the results reflected equivalence.

A study in the American Journal of Roentgenology titled ""Spending on Medical Imaging by Age and Gender in the U.S. Population With Employer-Sponsored Insurance"" observed that imaging utilization increased with aging until approximately age 80-85. As recorded in the study, and based on US Census data, the largest population growth is ""projected among individuals 40 to 50 years old and 65 years old and up"" pointing to the eventuality of increased imaging use amongst this cohort.
As utilization grows, payers should review their diagnostic imaging guidelines and consider managed programs that provide ordering physicians with the latest evidence-based medical criteria through consultations with specialists at leading academic radiology departments to ensure that the appropriate testing is performed, resulting in the best possible outcome for the member.

"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
â€œFor early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
â€œAdditionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.â€

"Radiation Therapy: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, reducing the number of fractions a patient receives can minimize toxicity to the patient while offering the same efficacy. However, it is still common for providers to order a course of fractionation outside of published, evidence-based guidelines.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his insight on the benefits of reduced fractionation for patients being treated for bone metastasis.
â€œASTRO guidelines recommend one to five fractions for management of bone mets. Providers routinely treat with 10 fractions or more in many clinical circumstances resulting in increased toxicity to the patient such as erythema and reduction of bone marrow burden. Conversion of treatment of bone metastasis from 10 fractions to five or one fraction is reflective of the ASTRO guidelines and helps minimize the potential negative side effects for the patient.""

"Demographic shifts lead to an uptick in imaging utilization.
A study in the American Journal of Roentgenology titled ""Spending on Medical Imaging by Age and Gender in the U.S. Population With Employer-Sponsored Insurance"" observed that imaging utilization increased with age until approximately age 80-85.
As recorded in the study and based on US Census data, the largest population growth is ""projected among individuals 40 to 50 years old and 65 years old and up"" pointing to the eventuality of increased imaging use amongst this cohort.
As utilization grows, payers should review their imaging guidelines and consider managed programs that provide ordering physicians with the latest evidence-based medical criteria through consultations with sub-specialists at leading academic departments to ensure that the appropriate testing is performed, resulting in the best possible outcome for the member.

"Prostate Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
Prostate cancer treatment remains a topic of debate amongst oncologists. The use of radiation therapy, in particular, can be a subject of controversy.
Very often, radiation therapy is recommended when ""watchful waiting"" may be a viable, if not preferred, option.
â€œPatients with low-risk prostate cancer should always be offered the choice of omission and watchful waiting. This approach is more common globally but less so in the United States,"" states Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a board-certified Radiation Oncologist, who currently serves as a Faculty Physician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
â€œWhy is this important? It's not just about reducing unnecessary harm and toxicity from radiation. It's also about cost savings from avoiding unnecessary treatments.â€

Additionally, our proactive specialist outreach during treatment planning allows ordering physicians the opportunity to speak to practicing peers at leading cancer centers to engage in discussions about maximizing patient outcomes.

"Musculoskeletal pain effects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. Back pain alone is the leading cause of disability for individuals under 45 years old with 80% of all adults reporting some degree of pain in their lifetime.
With such a significant portion of the population affected by Musculoskeletal pain, treatment can be very complex and determining the best care pathway can pose challenges for physicians. These challenges can prevent patients from receiving optimal care and drive up healthcare costs.
HealthHelp's approach to managing musculoskeletal procedures is built around a multidisciplinary and episode based approach. This approach reduces unnecessary care by educating physicians on appropriate care pathways and the causes of inappropriate treatments. The education and peer collaboration provided through the HealthHelp model is essential to ensure optimal outcomes for patients.

"#ArtificialIntelligence has the potential to transform the health sector. Clinical trials; medical diagnosis, treatment, self-care and person-centred care; and supplementing health care professionalsâ€™ knowledge, skills and competencies - these are all areas that hashtag#AI could enhance. Here is one example: AI could be beneficial in settings where there is a lack of medical specialists, e.g. in interpreting retinal scans and radiology images, among many others.
However, AI technologies are being rapidly deployed, sometimes without a full understanding of how they may perform, which could either benefit or harm end-users, including health-care professionals and patients. Recognising the potential and risks of AI, the World Health Organization published regulatory considerations on AI for health, covering the following aspects:

"A Massacre Shaming Humanity:
In a horrific act, Hamas not only reaffirmed but also outstripped its long-standing reputation as a ruthless terror organization. On a sacred Jewish holiday, terrorists from this extremist group controlling Gaza boldly and brutally breached Israelâ€™s borders, systematically murdering over 1200 defenseless civilians, from infants to the elderly, and the numbers keep rising as more of the 2800 severely injured are succumbing. Moreover, they unleashed a barrage of over 2300 missiles on Israeli soil during the first day, while their ground operatives heartlessly butchered innocents. The magnitude is incomprehensible. Considering the relative size of Israel and the U.S., envision nine 9/11 attacks occurring simultaneously, with each victim facing the direct wrath of these remorseless killers.
As a New Yorker, the memory of 9/11 is permanently imprinted in my mind, a day when friends and colleagues were lost within mere hours. Similarly, as an Israeli (and one supposed to fly to NYC the next day), 10/7 will forever scar our collective consciousness, a day where hardly any Israelis remain untouched, with most knowing at least one, if not several, of the victims.
The audacity and sheer malevolence of targeting defenseless people on a day of religious significance is beyond comprehension. The brutality exhibited by Hamas this time is unparalleled. This is not mere political violence; it is sadistic bloodlust. Launching thousands of missiles simultaneously with a ground assault on civilians highlights their meticulous planning in maximizing death and terror.
Kidnapping over 130 Israelis, including infants and elderly individuals, and dragging them into Gazaâ€™s dark confines compounds the nightmare. The uncertainty of their fates is agonizing, with every passing moment intensifying the trauma for their families.
This massacre shines a damning light on Hamas's twisted psyche and moral bankruptcy. Their perverse ideology, which devalues human life, whether Israeli or Palestinian, is a stark reminder of the darkness that lurks in our world. How can any entity be so consumed by hatred that it views mass murder as not only acceptable but also desirable?
The international communityâ€™s duty is clear and unequivocal. This grotesque act of terror demands the harshest condemnation, sanctions, and actions against Hamas and its leaders. This isnâ€™t just an Israeli tragedy; itâ€™s an assault on the conscience of humanity. As the heart-wrenching stories of the victims surface, the world must unite in its denunciation of such extremism. Hamasâ€™s unabated bloodlust underscores the urgent need for the global community to rally against these forces of darkness. Their reign of terror must end. Stand with Israel and the victims of the savages.

"Over the last decade, multiple geopolitical shocks have shifted the global operating environment toward one defined by great power competition, growing nationalism and decreased support for free trade.
In the International Monetary Fund's latest Global Financial Stability Report, staff warn rising gepolitical tensions threaten global financial stability including the cross-border allocation of capital, international payment systems and asset prices.
Their analysis finds that a one-standard-deviation increase in geopolitical tensions between an investing and a recipient country - equivalent to the diverging voting behavior of the US and China in the UN since 2016 - could reduce bilateral cross-border portfolio and bank allocation by 15%.
This latest report underscores the urgency with which policymakers, multinational corporations, civil society and citizens alike must work to reduce tensions and prevent further fragmentation and for companies, specificially, to invest in intellgience gathering, risk mitigation and strategic planning.

""As 2022 comes to a close, I'm reflecting on this year in ESG, at The Wharton School and beyond. In our July 1 launch we set out to harness the power of our faculty, alumni, students, and stakeholders to respond to the demands from ESG integrators with new research, trainings for future and current practitioners, and practical and policy insights in a manner that aligns with the evolving external environment - and we've done just that.
Starting next year Wharton undergraduates will be able to concentrate in ESG and Wharton MBAs will be able to major in ESG. Earlier this month I spoke with The New York Times about the business case for our new ESG courses and concentrations; it's not because we're driving an ideological agenda, it's because ESG is just good economics.

"AXA , Allianz , Swiss Re and other major insurers laid out an industry blueprint for climate goals at Davos this week, detailing the role they intend to play in the #energytransition.
Whether clean or dirty, #infrastructure and #energy projects must obtain #insurance cover before they can get #credit from #banks, thrusting the operations of insurers, reinsurers and brokers into the spotlight.
The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a climate-focused industry club whose membersâ€™ portfolios account for 15 per cent of global premiums, has given insurers until July 2024 to choose at least three climate targets to report against annually.
Among their options: expanding the number of clients who have set science-based net zero goals; doing more underwriting business for weather-related damage, carbon removal technologies or clean energy; and moving away from the most polluting clients.
Insurers served as â€œsocietyâ€™s early warning systemâ€, and were on the â€œfront linesâ€ of climate change, given the annual disaster-related losses exceeding $100bn that they have had to cover in recent years.
The NZIA has been plagued with fears that collective action to boycott certain industries could amount to a breach of competition law, and resisted pressure last year to recommend its members stop insuring all new coal projects, citing competition law risks.
It has, to a large extent, been playing catch-up with other groupings in the umbrella body Carney founded, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banking and asset owners issued their own target-setting guidelines in 2021 or earlier.
Activists argue that what insurers have now come up with amounts to a â€œfrustrating step backwardsâ€, for three geeky reasons.
Firstly, one of the decarbonisation targets insurers can choose from calls for them to cut emissions such as carbon and methane by at least 34 per cent by 2030 â€” notably lower than the minimum 43 per cent cut that the UNâ€™s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is aligned with the Paris agreement.
Secondly, certain important types of insurance, such as construction risk, which would be needed to build oil and gas plants, are out of scope.
Finally, targets do not have to include the scope 3 emissions of insurersâ€™ clients â€” emissions related to their supply chains and the use of products â€” for many companies, the biggest part of their carbon footprint. This appears to be at odds with a UN standard laid out at COP27 for the integrity of net zero targets, as well as the UNâ€™s Race to Zero campaign. Both stipulate carbon accounting should include mandatory disclosure of indirect emissions.

"âš¡ï¸#Energy and ðŸŒŽ#geopolitics have always been closely linked!
I had the pleasure to speak at the EY #Energy summit in #Rome about the impact of current #geopolitical trends on the #energytransition
Some of the points I made about the future geopolitical environment:
1. Based on my team's #scenario analysis on the #future of #globalisation we are moving towards a world in which the nature of geopolitical relations will matter much more (for details here: https://lnkd.in/gRHqH7_x)
2. There is a #paradigm #shift away from economic rationality and cost efficiency towards geopolitical and national security considerations: Geopolitics will determine #energy #security and hence shape energy markets. This will impact both fossil fuel and renewable energy supply chains.
3. While the war in Ukraine has posed an #energy #trilemma which saw a short-term emphasis on security of supply and affordability, in the medium-term #sustainability will remain a central goal. Also because in the long-term the energy transition will allow Europe to reduce its dependencies.
And these will be some of the many #implications:
1. Energy, energy #infrastructure and the #technologies linked to the transition will be at the center of #geostrategic #competition. They will therefore become a #tool and a #target of geopolitics.
2. There will be more #state #interventionism and industrial policy to secure national/European interests. This creates risks and opportunities and means #volatility and unpredictability.
3. Expect a #patchwork of #regulations and incentives within the #EU and globally. This will create a more complex operating environment.
4. On top of the ""old"" #dependencies (fossil fuels), new ones will emerge from the #renewable energy #supplychains which are more diffuse and complex.
Some of these trends can be found in other #sectors too: https://lnkd.in/eNFuuEtW

"There has been much heated discussion about the Department of Labor Rule on ERISA regarding the 2022 amendments by the Biden administration to the changes made in 2020 by the Trump administration. Some Republicans have expressed concern that ESG was going to be forced down unsuspecting investorsâ€™ throats. Bidenâ€™s veto of the bill passed in both the House and Senate was noted with some GOP fury and consternation. There was equal fury and consternation from the Dems when the Trump administration replaced prior SEC guidance from the Obama administration in promulgating a new rule.
The elements of the ERISA Rule regarding ESG has become a political football. Whatâ€™s striking to me is how subtle changes in language lead to loud hollering on both sides. The volume of reaction is far greater than the substance of the changes.
In an effort to focus on substance rather than ideological convictions,Timothy M. Doyle (R) of the Bipartisan Policy Center and yours truly (D) have collaborated on a piece that digs into the technical details of just what has changed. The Trump administration removed the term ESG and talked instead in terms of â€œpecuniaryâ€ issues which were defined as those that have a â€œmaterial effect on the risk and/or return of an investment based on appropriate investment time horizonsâ€ consistent with the plan. Since ESG is all about material issues (and not a cabal of the global elite attacking America) Iâ€™m fine with that.
Iâ€™m also fine with the language as amended under Biden which states that fiduciaries should focus on â€œrelevant risk and return factorsâ€ that ""may include the economic effects of climate change and ESG. (Note it says 'may,' not 'must.') It also held that a fiduciaryâ€™s duty requires that they â€œnot subordinate the interests of participants and beneficiaries (such as by sacrificing investment returns or taking on additional investment risk) to objectives unrelated to the plan."" That said, I should also note that the Biden 2022 amendments specifically removed any reference to the term â€œmaterial.â€ I think the reasons for doing so were specious and that this was a mistake.
Given a fiduciaryâ€™s existing duty of loyalty and prudence, the foundation of ERISA for 50 years, it seems to me that it all depends on what a fiduciary prudently considers in their risk and return analysis. Do they consider strictly â€œpecuniaryâ€ factors, or do they look more broadly at â€œrelevantâ€ economic factors? Both presumably have an economic connection to investment analysis. Where to draw the line between these should be left to the judgement of the fiduciary, not dictated by a political ideology of any stripe.
Call me naÃ¯ve, but ERISA should be a place of great bipartisan agreement rather than being weaponized in the ESG Culture Wars.

"A Successful Net Zero Transition Goes Beyond Carbon Metrics
Orsted, the Danish electricity utility, is hailed as the posterchild of the net zero transition. Orsted has lowered its carbon intensity and absolute emissions by over 80% since its decision to switch to renewables 14 years ago. Back in 2009, 85% of Orsted electricity was generated by burning coal and only 15% came from renewable sources. Today, 86% of the company energy comes from renewable sources.
Many people in this the ESG/Climate sector know Orsted, and its successful energy transition (from a carbon perspective). What it less known is the fact that Orsted did not only maintain its operating margins by switching to renewables, it has substantially improved its return on capital, almost doubled shareholder equity, and more than doubled earning per share (The tables I added to the chart below compares Orsted's financials in the low and high GHG emitting years). This part of the story is as much worth highlighting as the substantial decline in the company GHG emissions when citing Orsted transformation.
To me, a successful net zero transition canâ€™t only be measured by climate metrics, investors need to have confidence in the resulting financial metrics tied to the net zero transition. As of today, investors lack the tools to make such assessments, but as more companies successfully transition, the relationship between climate metrics and financial impacts will increasingly clarify within a multitude of sectors.
ESG data startups who can build tools to help with such comparative financial analytics between transitioning and non-transitioning companies will find plenty of eager customers.

The logic that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are material spans asset classes and investment strategies. Analyzing that link, however, takes the right data, modeling strategy and mix of academic rigor and practical insight.

"""ESG, in essence, is a free market, organic and an investor driven movement to ask firms to disclose more information about the described factors associated with their future cash flows or cost of capital. Investors would be derelict of their fiduciary responsibility to their stakeholders if they did not consider the material factors when making an investment decision. Prohibiting consideration of material ESG factors simply interferes with the provision of data to make asset markets efficient at pricing these risks and returns. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that substantial losses will be incurred by the constituents of the states such as Texas where legislation that infringes on the public pension fundâ€™s freedom to invest have been passed in recent months.""

"Last week I had the pleasure of joining The Wharton School Schoolâ€™s Global Alumni Forum in Singapore, held for the first time in three years after a hiatus due to COVID. As a top two strategic priority of the school, The ESG Initiative at the Wharton School was prominently featured with an ESG Master Class that I taught on Friday the 10th and a plenary panel discussion on Saturday, March 11 that I moderated amongst - Alp Ercil, ENG95, W95, Founder and CIO, Asia Research and Capital Management, LTD
- Kamran Khan, G93, Managing Director, Head of ESG for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank - Jing Zhang, WG09, Executive Director at Trade & Working Capital, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Both sessions were extremely well-received amongst the 900+ attendees of the forum. Together they provided background and clarity on the currently polarized political debate on ESG as well as charting a path forward past peak anti-ESG by focusing on the hard work of incorporating ESG factors into investment valuations. The three panelists highlighted impressive efforts made by each of them and their organizations to incorporate the energy transition and reshoring trends into valuation models in Asia with a particular focus not just on risk but also the enormous investment opportunities of green technology. Alumni engagement on ESG topics continued across numerous networking breaks, lunch conversations and dinners. I look forward to continuing the conversation with our alumni at the 2024 forum in Sao Paolo next June.

"M&A dealmakers cancelling deals because of ESG due diligence findings
A KPMG survey of over 200 U.S. ESG practitioners including corporate investors, financial investors, and M&A debt providers found that over half of the respondents reported that they have cancelled deals due to material findings during ESG due diligence.
In addition, nearly two thirds of investors would pay a premium for companies aligned with their ESG priorities.
The survey found that three quarters (74%) of professionals are already integrating ESG considerations as part of their M&A agenda, with the identification of ESG risks and opportunities given as the top reason for conducting ESG due diligence, by 46% of respondents, followed by requirements by investors, cited by 19%, and preparation for regulatory requirements by 14%

"ðŸ”¬ðŸ“ˆ Rebalancing Capitalism or Delaying Real Progress? A Critical Examination of Impact Measurement and Valuation
ðŸ’¡ The guiding question of our symposium at this year's Academy of Management annual meeting was truly thought-provoking: ""Can measuring the impact of business on society and the planet lead to a more socially and environmentally-oriented style of capitalism?""
The goals of the session were the following:
ðŸŽ¯ Introducing participants to key issues related to impact measurement and valuation: Understanding and quantifying the effects businesses have on society and the environment is the first step towards making them ""actionable"" and thus towards building a more sustainable economy.
ðŸ” Critically examining the ethics and politics of impact measurement, valuation/""dollarization"" and its standardization: Recognizing the potential pitfalls and biases in the method development and implementation process is vital to ensuring fair and equitable practices that lead to meaningful numbers - and subsequently change.
ðŸ’¡ Envisioning new processes that work with or replace organizationsâ€™ desire for management via quantification: Exploring innovative approaches to impact measurement that align with organizational goals while validly accounting for their social and environmental externalities as well as their positive contributions.
We had a great panel including Judith Stroehle, Florian Berg, Witold Henisz, Andrew King and Henry Mintzberg, moderated by Nien-hÃª Hsieh. The discussions were eye-opening, and it was inspiring to witness the collective commitment to the joint goal of more transparent and sustainable business practices. ðŸ¤ðŸŒ±
ðŸ’ªðŸŒŽ Let's continue to work together to develop impact measurement practices which are rigorous and effective! What gets measured gets managed. At the same time, let us keep in mind that not everything that counts can be counted.
To put it in the words of Henry Mintzberg: ""I love numbers and I am highly suspicious!""
A big thank you also goes to my co-organizers Emma van den Terrell and Prof. Dr. Ali Aslan GÃ¼mÃ¼say.

"Dear Fellow Faculty and Administrators,
The The ESG Initiative at the Wharton School is again hosting our Turner Impact Portfolio Challenge (TIPC). This is a free, nationwide program that gives graduate students experiential learning in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) portfolio construction.
TIPC is designed to equip graduate students with the knowledge and practical skills to design and execute 100% ESG and impact investing portfolios. The challenge was developed by the ESG Initiative at the Wharton School in response to both growing student interest in ESG and impact investing, and industry demand for practical impact experience for new hires.
Please share this opportunity with your students and encourage them to form a team. The process of submitting a team application is quick, and the form will remain open through October 8th. Teams that submit the top five portfolios will be invited to participate in the final competition on Whartonâ€™s campus in April 2024 to pitch live to a panel of industry judges.
