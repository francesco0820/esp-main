"Normally, a better-than-expected jobs report is great news for commercial real estate demand. The news of 500,000 plus job additions in January, as well as record-low unemployment rates, should be no exception as far as long-term property fundamentals are concerned. However, this may prompt the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rate hikes for longer. Nonetheless, investors should keep two factors in mind:
1) The jobs report showed strength in lower-paying employment categories.
2) The effects of past interest rate hikes have yet to show up in slowing economic activity fully.

"It was great to host yesterdayâ€™s Delaware State Chamber of Commerce Networking Breakfast. Medical education is an essential part of how ChristianaCare serves our community, and Neil Jasani shared some key facts about ChristianaCareâ€™s important role as Delawareâ€™s medical school, including:
-- ChristianaCare is the only academic medical center between Philadelphia and Baltimore. Over the past 121 years, we have graduated more than 3,000 residents and fellows.
-- ChristianaCare is the Delaware Branch Campus for Thomas Jefferson University's Sidney Kimmel Medical College (SKMC) and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM).
-- Since 2013, ChristianaCare has had almost 220 students at the branch campus, more than half with a direct Delaware connection. Dozens of those students received their medical education through the support of the Delaware Institute for Medical Education and Research (DIMER), a program that ensures Delawareans get access to high-quality medical education at SKMC or PCOM. This program is an excellent value for Delaware, because it provides a high-quality medical education pipeline at costs well below what it would take to support a brick-and-mortar medical school in Delaware.

"Out today, Ciscoâ€™s #Cybersecurity Readiness Index highlights that only 15% of organizations have a cybersecurity posture thatâ€™s mature enough to defend against the threats of a hybrid world. We measured the cybersecurity readiness of companies across five key pillars - identity, devices, network, application workloads, and data - and the results were clear: no matter what kind of business you operate and no matter where you are in the world, security resilience is imperative in todayâ€™s world.
At first this may sound frightening, and itâ€™s true that weâ€™re facing a threat landscape thatâ€™s more expansive than weâ€™ve ever seen, with attack methods changing at a rapid pace and bad actors getting more sophisticated. In fact, 82% of leaders expect a cybersecurity incident to disrupt their business within the next two years. Weâ€™ve been living and working in new ways for over three years, and we know people, devices, workloads, and applications will continue to be more and more distributed moving forward. Organizations are accelerating their multi-cloud adoption more quickly than many expected. In this dynamic environment, a number of my peers have expressed that they donâ€™t worry about if a breach will happen, but when.
But despite so much uncertainty, I remain optimistic. I believe the data highlights the opportunities that exist for the public and private sectors to work together to close the readiness gap. With tighter alignment and partnership, we can truly reap all the benefits of our connected world, without fear of disruption. We all depend on a secure world, and if we share threat intelligence, cooperate on legislation to keep everyone safe, and rally around the idea that security and privacy are human rights, we can realize a truly secure and inclusive future for all.
As the builders of the internet, security remains critical for Ciscoâ€™s business and our ability to support our customersâ€™ resilience. Our team is dedicated to building the simple, intelligent, interoperable, and platform-driven solutions our customers demand today and will need tomorrow. Youâ€™ll be hearing more from us in the weeks and months to come, and Iâ€™m so excited about whatâ€™s ahead for Cisco and security.

Did you know? On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln enacted the Emancipation Proclamation, officially declaring the end of slavery. However, thousands of people living in slavery werenâ€™t made aware of their freedom until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston on June 19, 1865 meaning that for over two and a half years, many remained in slavery despite being freed. Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates freedom.

"The world needs Africa to thrive. Home to the youngest and fastest-growing population on Earth, the continent will play a critical role in our ability to make the transition to net zero and lessen the emerging impact of demographic decline.
My McKinsey Global Institute colleagues have just published a new report on Africa. They describe it as a â€œclarion call for sustainable, inclusive growth.â€ It takes a granular look at Africaâ€™s economic performance, highlighting successes across its countries, cities, and companies.
You can read it here: https://lnkd.in/gmBdRT7K
The report finds that Africaâ€™s growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But thereâ€™s no â€˜one Africa.â€™ Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from whatâ€™s working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sectorâ€”even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010â€”it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.
Achieving results like that across sectors and markets wonâ€™t be easy, especially amid todayâ€™s headwinds. But it will be essential to help the continentâ€”and the global economyâ€”thrive.

"Earlier this week, my family acknowledged the 30th anniversary of the untimely death of my visionary aunt, Dr. Shanti Jain.
When I was 12 years old, I quietly watched Shanti Auntie take her last breaths. We shared a train cabin as we traversed the deserts of Rajasthan, India. She awakened in the middle of the night gasping for air, struggling. My parents awakened alongside her and searched for help, for a tank of oxygen. Abruptly, the gasping stopped. I called out to ask if she was okay. ""Is she dead?"" I asked innocently. There was no response. Brief sobs and then quiet. The train rolled on in the darkness.
Before writing these words, I had not shared the experience of witnessing my aunt's death. Death is one of those subjects that is almost always fumbled. If we discuss it at length, we run the risk of dwelling on a moment beyond its useful life. If we maintain our silence, the accompanying loss can haunt us for a lifetime. There were many remarkable things about the moments leading up to and following my aunt's death.
Perhaps most personally impactful was my aunt's decisive role in establishing my career path. As we waited to board the train, my aunt, carrying the burden of a new diagnosis of stage IV ovarian cancer, asked me if I would become a doctor, like her. I told her I wasn't sure. Sitting in the wheelchair loaded with chemotherapy, I could not deny her. I promised her that I would. And while I fought my promise in the years following--I always returned to it--until it was fulfilledâ€”with her as my inspiration.
The bitterly ironic circumstances of my aunt's death still confound me. Shanti Auntie had spent most of her life fighting to give rural populations access to health care. When it mattered most, she lacked access to good health care herself. The symptoms of her ovarian cancer, a notoriously insidious killer, were misdiagnosed over and over again. By the time she had the definitive imaging, her CT scan was alight with cancer.
Perhaps most remarkable--and most heartening--was the response of the family and friends who cared about her most. My aunt was not a famous doctor by any stretch of the imagination. Yet she was a giant in the lives of people who were touched by her grace and big personality. After her death, her brothers and sisters resolved to make her life--and deathâ€”count. One by one, they took up the causes that mattered to her most. In the years following her loss, we have collectively worked to improve health care in the small villages (Phalodi and Khichan) where she lived and served. And my own career, inspired by her example, has focused on making healthcare just a bit better.
Ryan Holiday has written that the ""obstacle is the way.""
That which obstructs our progress.
That which stands in our way can also propel us forward.
Coping with loss is never easy, but it is in managing through it that we can find the future and sometimes, even, ourselves.",MISC

We had a wide-ranging conversation on SCAN and the future of the healthcare industry.
Some snippets from our dialog:
â€œOne of the biggest problems we have in healthcare is that most healthcare entrepreneurs donâ€™t need healthcare and donâ€™t realize how dystopic some of the things that theyâ€™re creating areâ€” until they actually need them on the other side of things.â€
â€œI think we have an authenticity problem in healthcare. Everyone starts out with the greatest intent to drive the most change, and then before long, the pressures start to circulate around you and youâ€™re just trying to survive, and then you build something thatâ€™s just as mediocre as the things that youâ€™re trying to replace.â€

Being able to stay anonymous reduces the barrier to entry for a lot of folks. It has helped many seek therapy and feel more comfortable talking to someone. Truly an amazing mind-blowing idea. Plus, meeting and hearing Jewel's raw personal story around her own mental health issues, panic attacks, and anxiety was both humbling and inspiring.
While we've made a lot of progress when it comes to treating #MentalHealth, there remains a great deal of stigma. Jewel's work with Innerworld is just one part of getting to a future where mental health conditions are treated no different than physical diseases like diabetes or hypertension. Mental health IS health! Our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can absolutely positively and negatively affect our biological functioning. In other words, our minds can affect how healthy our bodies are it's so important we take care of both.

"I've just returned from a lovely family holiday in the Canadian Rockies and British Columbia â€“ truly stunning surroundings. The combination of wonderful weather, outdoors activity, wildlife and quality time with the family was the perfect tonic. I feel refreshed and energised, ready to forge ahead. Just before I left I spoke with Financial Newsâ€™s Penny Sukhraj about Oliver Wymanâ€™s journey. In a wide-ranging and engaging chat, recharging was one of the topics we discussed.
While the article is behind a paywall, I'd like to reflect on some of its messages. As per the headline, ten years ago we had the humility to know who we were and what we were, and werenâ€™t, good at. I'm deeply proud of how we've grown, how our teams have built incredible relationships and trust with our clients, and how we've expanded our expertise to confidently compete and succeed in supporting clients in a wider range of their transformative moments. But at the same time we need to continue to ask demanding questions of ourselves and to try to maintain that humility as a core value that is necessary for ongoing development.
The article also discusses my views on the need to work together in person. Our first principle is that we will be wherever our clients need us to be, but beyond that I am a big believer in the hybrid working model. We have been aiming for 50% in person and are now looking to tweak that up to an average of three days a week (which is actually close to our recent average in three of our regions).
We need to ensure a vibrant team culture with high quality apprenticeship and stretching personal development which is better in person, as well as to maintain the benefits we have all gained by being able to be more flexible and to work remotely some of the time. Both offsite and onsite work offer distinct benefits and we are determined to perfect the hybrid model that best serves our clients and teams.",MISC

"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
â€œFor early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
â€œAdditionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.â€
At HealthHelp, our evidence-based guidelines prioritize what's best for the patient. By staying up-to-date with the latest research and medical practices, we ensure that every decision made is in the best interest of the patient's well-being. Our radiation oncology program is based on physician collaboration and education. This includes our proactive specialist outreach that allows ordering physicians the opportunity to connect with practicing peers at leading cancer centers to discuss treatment pans that maximize patient outcomes.

"Divorce changes pretty much everything. Whether itâ€™s a surprise or something youâ€™re both on board with, youâ€™ve gone from a â€œweâ€ to a â€œme"" â€” and that can take some getting used to.
Maybe you were involved in the family finances while you were married, or maybe not. Either way, now the checkbook is in your hands. And that checkbook may look different than what you expected.
Why? Frustratingly, research shows that womenâ€™s household income falls almost twice as much as menâ€™s post-split. And divorce can affect womenâ€™s money in a lot of other ways, too.
Thatâ€™s a lot. And dealing with it is also pretty urgent. Financial instability is stressful and disruptive (especially if youâ€™re in a pretty emotional place right now).
That's why the Ellevest team put together a post-divorce guide at the link below. Our all-woman team of financial advisors has helped thousands of women model out the impact of a divorce settlement and what it â€Œmeans for their finances before itâ€™s too late.",MISC
"I rarely post, but feel compelled to call out companies that have not publicly expressed solidarity with the people of Israel during this terribly difficult time. Israel suffered a terrorist attack that on a comparative basis was exponentially much worse than the loss of life here on 9/11. While certain businesses may be hesitant out of concern for upsetting some of their employees out of fear for the appearance of taking sides, there can be debate that what happened was evil in its worst form. Would anyone hesitate to say that the Nazis were evil? Or more recently, would anyone have hesitated to call out what Al Queda or the Taliban have done as evil?
