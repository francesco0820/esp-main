The programme aims to equip future leaders in Finance with the capabilities they need today and in the future and to expand their network by fostering cross-functional collaboration.

"One of my coolest experiences so far this year has been meeting and hugging Jewel (Thank you, AHIP!). Her new Metaverse venture, Innerworld, is an amazing virtual reality-based wellness center where people can use an anonymous avatar to access free mental health tools in a safe space. Increasing accessibility is key! Y
The concept of an anonymous safe space in which to share explore and learn is fascinating and perhaps opens a new paradigm in treating mental health conditions. Being able to stay anonymous reduces the barrier to entry for a lot of folks. It has helped many seek therapy and feel more comfortable talking to someone. Truly an amazing mind-blowing idea. Plus, meeting and hearing Jewel's raw personal story around her own mental health issues, panic attacks, and anxiety was both humbling and inspiring.
While we've made a lot of progress when it comes to treating #MentalHealth, there remains a great deal of stigma. Jewel's work with Innerworld is just one part of getting to a future where mental health conditions are treated no different than physical diseases like diabetes or hypertension. Mental health IS health! Our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can absolutely positively and negatively affect our biological functioning. In other words, our minds can affect how healthy our bodies are it's so important we take care of both.

The report finds that Africa's growth has downshifted since 2010 and lags that of its global peers. But there's no "" one Africa.' Almost half its people live in countries where economies have grown consistently over the past 20 years.
By learning from what's working, focusing on productivity, and removing obstacles to growth, Africa could return to a growth trajectory in the decade ahead. One example: if the continent could increase productivity in the services sector""even if only to the level it achieved between 2000 and 2010""it could increase gross value added by $400 billion by 2030.

""As 2022 comes to a close, I'm reflecting on this year in ESG, at The Wharton School and beyond.

Starting next year Wharton undergraduates will be able to concentrate in ESG and Wharton MBAs will be able to major in ESG. Earlier this month I spoke with The New York Times about the business case for our new ESG courses and concentrations; it's not because we're driving an ideological agenda, it's because ESG is just good economics.

"Earlier this week, my family acknowledged the 30th anniversary of the untimely death of my visionary aunt, Dr. Shanti Jain.
When I was 12 years old, I quietly watched Shanti Auntie take her last breaths. We shared a train cabin as we traversed the deserts of Rajasthan, India. She awakened in the middle of the night gasping for air, struggling. My parents awakened alongside her and searched for help, for a tank of oxygen. Abruptly, the gasping stopped. I called out to ask if she was okay. ""Is she dead?"" I asked innocently. There was no response. Brief sobs and then quiet. The train rolled on in the darkness.
Before writing these words, I had not shared the experience of witnessing my aunt's death. Death is one of those subjects that is almost always fumbled. If we discuss it at length, we run the risk of dwelling on a moment beyond its useful life. If we maintain our silence, the accompanying loss can haunt us for a lifetime. There were many remarkable things about the moments leading up to and following my aunt's death.
Perhaps most personally impactful was my aunt's decisive role in establishing my career path. As we waited to board the train, my aunt, carrying the burden of a new diagnosis of stage IV ovarian cancer, asked me if I would become a doctor, like her. I told her I wasn't sure. Sitting in the wheelchair loaded with chemotherapy, I could not deny her. I promised her that I would. And while I fought my promise in the years following--I always returned to it--until it was fulfilled""with her as my inspiration.
The bitterly ironic circumstances of my aunt's death still confound me. Shanti Auntie had spent most of her life fighting to give rural populations access to health care. When it mattered most, she lacked access to good health care herself. The symptoms of her ovarian cancer, a notoriously insidious killer, were misdiagnosed over and over again. By the time she had the definitive imaging, her CT scan was alight with cancer.
Perhaps most remarkable--and most heartening--was the response of the family and friends who cared about her most. My aunt was not a famous doctor by any stretch of the imagination. Yet she was a giant in the lives of people who were touched by her grace and big personality. After her death, her brothers and sisters resolved to make her life--and death""count. One by one, they took up the causes that mattered to her most. In the years following her loss, we have collectively worked to improve health care in the small villages (Phalodi and Khichan) where she lived and served. And my own career, inspired by her example, has focused on making healthcare just a bit better.
Ryan Holiday has written that the ""obstacle is the way.""
That which obstructs our progress.
That which stands in our way can also propel us forward.
Coping with loss is never easy, but it is in managing through it that we can find the future and sometimes, even, ourselves.",MISC

"Breast Cancer Treatment: Navigating Optimal Patient Care
In radiation therapy, the application of hypofractionation (HF) to minimize the number of treatment sessions can have significant benefits for patients. By reducing the number of fractions a patient receives, its possible to minimize side effects while offering them the convenience of completing their treatment without multiple visits to the treating facility.
Dr. Amin Mirhadi, medical director for oncology services for HealthHelp and a practicing, board-certified Radiation Oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, shares his perspective on how patients being treated for early stage breast cancer can benefit from HF.
""For early stage breast cancer, there is still an overutilization of standard fractionation. Conversion of standard fractionation in breast cancer to hypofractionation is an important effort on the part of the radiation oncology community. Not only is there a substantial cost reduction, there is also significantly fewer side effects as validated by both European and Canadian data. In addition, there is a higher compliance rate which with completion of therapy due to the shorter interval time that is necessary.""
""Additionally, early stage breast cancer patients who have tumors less than 2.5 cm may also be eligible for ultra hypofractionation regimens. When the clinical indication applies, this results in far fewer side effects and has been validated by the Florence protocol. This will allow skin sparing and has produced results similar to whole breast radiation.""
At HealthHelp, our evidence-based guidelines prioritize what's best for the patient. By staying up-to-date with the latest research and medical practices, we ensure that every decision made is in the best interest of the patient's well-being. Our radiation oncology program is based on physician collaboration and education. This includes our proactive specialist outreach that allows ordering physicians the opportunity to connect with practicing peers at leading cancer centers to discuss treatment pans that maximize patient outcomes.

With every seat taken, the energy of a crowded room filled with professionals with a lot of interest in Roche was both humbling and inspiring. The sentiment is improving.

- Innovative portfolio driving momentum: Our launched portfolio, among the youngest in the industry, is setting new standards and creating a strong growth trajectory in the years to come.
- Strengthening our pipeline: Our focus is on strengthening our late-stage pipeline, both by internal innovation and by business development. The recent strides in further improving the standard of care in hypertension and inflammatory bowel disease are a testament to this approach.
- Upcoming opportunities in Diagnostics: The anticipation is building for the first fully integrated and automated mass spectrometer for clinical use set to launch in 2024.

We had a wide-ranging conversation on SCAN and the future of the healthcare industry.
Some snippets from our dialog:
""One of the biggest problems we have in healthcare is that most healthcare entrepreneurs don't need healthcare and don't realize how dystopic some of the things that they're creating are"" until they actually need them on the other side of things.""
""I think we have an authenticity problem in healthcare. Everyone starts out with the greatest intent to drive the most change, and then before long, the pressures start to circulate around you and you're just trying to survive, and then you build something that's just as mediocre as the things that you're trying to replace.""
""We've normalized the abnormal in the Medicare Advantage industry, and we've normalized the abnormal in health care more broadly. The opportunity for us is to try to simplify things on behalf of seniors.""

"Layoffs can conversely lead to resignations in a workforce. The question is, why?
Layoffs can create an atmosphere of stress and anxiety in the workplace. Employees, if not reassured, constantly worry they may be next. Doing nothing to assuage fears can degrade trust in management, leading to employees quitting because they feel unsupported by their work environment.
Employers should ask themselves "" am I doing enough to maintain trust and nurture talent?

Mindfulness and Mindful interactions
As I have observed, the pandemic has left us with many learnings and some new habits! The habit that has formed and its permissibility seems widely accepted "" is that we can multi task during meetings and interactions, especially those that are screen based - remote, virtual, or hybrid.
The multi tasking habit or sickness, is where our eyes (and our mind) no longer needs to be attending to the colleague or guest we have in a given meeting or interaction
Do you all see that?
I see that a lot and I have made a personal decision to not subscribe to it!
Pre "" Pandemic, our meetings were predominantly physical, and we were taking notes, watching the presentation, making eye contact, etc. Today, I find that in many meetings, multi tasking by way of reviewing another screen has become table stakes. Permissible.
Mindfulness is a much larger topic and quality of meetings, plenty has been said about it!
Yet, (limiting my comments to the workplace), giving undivided attention or at least making every effort to do so "" has to be table stakes.
During video meetings, it is blatantly clear when the other party is not giving full attention. Roving eyes, tilted views of the head to view multiple screens, etc. I have recently observed this even during candidate interviews, which my career lessons speak to sacrosanct focus as table stakes!
If we are aware of this and no longer bothered by it, therein lies the assumed permissibility and personally, I am not subscribing to!
If I am an invitee or attendee, I am sticking to the full immersion rule..
If I am the meeting organizer, as I say to my teams : I am ready to have as long or as short of a meeting, as is supported by our mutually focused and undistracted engagement with each other.
When we are primed for a mindset of total immersion, it is no longer difficult to give our undivided attention during interactions.
The loss of productivity and creativity is real, yet not easily measured.

"Capacity issues in healthcare, compounded by staff shortages and heavy workloads, remain critical.. We need to harness real-time data and algorithms for better triaging and care optimisation.
As highlighted in this great article by Bayer | Pharmaceuticals, Huma has already demonstrated how digital tools can ease healthcare pressures and enhance patient outcomes. It's time we boost these advancements with #ai / #genai and here are some critical questions we are contemplating and addressing at Huma:
a Is it possible to automate administrative and operational processes, thereby granting HCPs more time to focus on their primary role and what they do best - delivering patient care. And could these advancements morph a nurse into a ""super nurse"", extending their reach, enhancing their efficiency and capacity..?
a For patients, can we develop a mechanism to automate disease pathway navigation, which is not only personalised but also empathetic, functioning as a co-pilot? Empowered and engaged patient = better clinical outcomes
a Can we use clinically validated / regulatory approved algorithms capable of detecting and quantifying disease processes? This will enable both, better self management by patients, and delivery proactive / preventative care by providers.
Indeed the answers are positive, however, it is paramount that these are implemented in an ethical and safe manner within the critical realm of health care. Cross-sectoral collaboration will be the key to unlocking this immense potential.

Our first principle is that we will be wherever our clients need us to be, but beyond that I am a big believer in the hybrid working model. We have been aiming for 50% in person and are now looking to tweak that up to an average of three days a week (which is actually close to our recent average in three of our regions).

"Amazon today announced the completion of their acquisition of One Medical weeks after CVS Health announced the acquisition of Oak Street Health.
These deals have the potential to be transformative for the healthcare industry and for patients""and both companies have world-class operating executives in place to shepherd the acquisitions in Amir Dan Rubin and Amar A. Desai, MD, MPH.
That said, the history of big publicly-traded companies owning health care delivery has been mixed""at best.
In order for these deals to live of to their potential, both corporations will need to commit to something that is often unnatural in publicly-traded companies.
Namely, a distinctive operating culture within the context of a much broader organization whose products and services are largely unlike.
Some key imperatives:
Avoid the temptation for corporate conformity: no one likes to hear this, but healthcare delivery is different. HR process, compliance requirements, financial management""all require a different lens. Big companies who do similar sounding and related but fundamentally different things (health insurance v health care delivery; pharmacy v primary care) tend to demand and expect homogeneity, sometimes to the detriment of the acquired entity.
Remember that in healthcare delivery, patients always have to come before profit: this isn't corporate pablum but the most fundamental tenet of healthcare delivery. Organizations lose the hearts and minds of the front line (where the true value is created) when short-term thinking mortgages the long-term prospects. Scarcity of resources and the drive towards earnings can lead to anti-patient activities that erode morale and destroy long-term value.
Focus on talent retention: in clinical companies, the product is the clinician-patient relationships. Big companies tend to treat frontline workers like they are interchangeable parts. This is a losing strategy in healthcare where the patient's allegiance to the doctor trumps their allegiance to the company, the health system, pharmacy, or the health insurer.
Remember to be relentless in connecting the dots: these deals were built on the premise that 1+1 could equal 3. Amazon could potentially connect its Prime services with its primary care capabilities. CVS its pharmacy with its primary care. These connection points represent the innovation promise of these deals. But because of the silos that exist in large corporations, these are often the opportunities that get shelved most quickly. Corporate politics and fiefdoms get in the way of true value creation.
Leadership from the top will matter a lot. The tendency to tell leaders to ""figure it out"" won't be enough. There will need to be clear direction from the CEOs of both corporations""Andy Jassy and Karen S. Lynch""and the kind of upfront problem-solving that happens far too rarely in big corporations.

"Out today, Cisco's #Cybersecurity Readiness Index highlights that only 15% of organizations have a cybersecurity posture that's mature enough to defend against the threats of a hybrid world. We measured the cybersecurity readiness of companies across five key pillars - identity, devices, network, application workloads, and data - and the results were clear: no matter what kind of business you operate and no matter where you are in the world, security resilience is imperative in today's world.
At first this may sound frightening, and it's true that we're facing a threat landscape that's more expansive than we've ever seen, with attack methods changing at a rapid pace and bad actors getting more sophisticated. In fact, 82% of leaders expect a cybersecurity incident to disrupt their business within the next two years. We've been living and working in new ways for over three years, and we know people, devices, workloads, and applications will continue to be more and more distributed moving forward. Organizations are accelerating their multi-cloud adoption more quickly than many expected. In this dynamic environment, a number of my peers have expressed that they don't worry about if a breach will happen, but when.
But despite so much uncertainty, I remain optimistic. I believe the data highlights the opportunities that exist for the public and private sectors to work together to close the readiness gap. With tighter alignment and partnership, we can truly reap all the benefits of our connected world, without fear of disruption. We all depend on a secure world, and if we share threat intelligence, cooperate on legislation to keep everyone safe, and rally around the idea that security and privacy are human rights, we can realize a truly secure and inclusive future for all.
As the builders of the internet, security remains critical for Cisco's business and our ability to support our customers' resilience. Our team is dedicated to building the simple, intelligent, interoperable, and platform-driven solutions our customers demand today and will need tomorrow.

"I asked a generative AI program to write a LinkedIn post about a current tech policy trend. As you can see, AI won't be ascending to the throne of thought leader anytime soon; the post is primarily a fluffed regurgitation of facts. Not bad for some surface-level online engagement, but does it have any unique, thought-provoking perspective? Is it *saying* anything, or is it just *reciting*?
In its current state, generative AI should be considered a tool, not a one-stop shop. These tools could be useful for trend analysis or background research, which can then be incorporated into an individual's own thought leadership. But as companies start rolling out new uses for AI in their business, remember the one thing we all have that this tech doesn't: our own unique voice.
There are estimates saying generative AI could become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, so this is definitely an area to keep a very close eye on.
What do you think about the post AI created?

While organizations need to rightsize their cost structure or transform or modernize their operations, I have often seen organizations that provide care to patients lay off clinical staff without regard to the clinical needs or obligations that they have to their patients.

"As I consider the future of the tax profession, diversity continues to be a top priority. Creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce is mission critical, and leaders "" myself included "" need to prioritize tangible solutions that create more opportunities for diverse talent to enter and succeed in our profession. A more balanced workforce ultimately leads to an improved culture and more profitable business. Today, KPMG US launched its 2023 Impact Report sharing the many strides we've made as a firm and practice in support of our people and planet. The report is one more great example of our commitment to diversity, transparency, culture, sustainable practices and our principles. In Tax specifically, one tangible example of our commitment to diversity is our recently launched Tax Scholarship Program. The program is designed to enable individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to further their studies at a school of their choice and grants up to $40K in funding to eligible students, giving them access to the vast KPMG Tax network, including mentors, coaches, internship opportunities and more.
Below are just a few more examples of ways KPMG is working to expand our diversity, as outlined in the report: - Rehires have increased year over year, especially for those from underrepresented backgrounds - 49% of new hires identify as part of an underrepresented racial/ethnic group - Over two-thirds of our FY23 promotion class are from underrepresented backgrounds. To learn more about how a continued investment in our people has been fundamental to our success as a firm, I hope you'll read through this latest Impact Report. While there's always more work to do, we have much to be proud of and I'm looking forward to continuing our important work #Together.

"Layoffs are among the most challenging life experiences. One study notes it can cause as much psychological stress as a divorce. For remote workers, layoffs can be especially isolating and destabilizing.
People are the most important part of any company, but as the economy shifts and companies are forced to make difficult workforce decisions, it's the responsibility of the company to help their employees navigate this challenging process.
We can learn something from Nokia's people-first strategy during its 2011 restructuring. At the time, it gave advance notice to affected personnel by offering multiple pathways for employees, like helping them find new roles internally, start their own business or start educational programs.

"Thank you to Cornell Tech for hosting the Cornell Tech Board Institute in-person on the hashtag#RooseveltIsland campus on Nov. 3-4. The program: Board Governance: Navigating Emerging Technologies and Future Frontiers, featured discussions on a broad range of opportunities and challenges that confront modern boards, including the board's role in setting business strategy, the role of data as a strategic asset, AI use cases and risks, digital transformation of supply chains, emerging ransomware and cybersecurity threats, geopolitics, the growing regulatory burden, and uncertainty and challenges posed by activist investors. We also discussed navigating ""difficult"" boardroom conversations and how to get insurance that maps to business risk. We brought together leading CEOs, directors, jurists, thought-leaders and scholars for a thorough examination of corporate governance and the role of the board of directors. Thank you to our speakers and our participants! Already looking forward to the next event.
