With every seat taken, the energy of a crowded room filled with professionals with a lot of interest in Roche was both humbling and inspiring. The sentiment is improving.

"As I consider the future of the tax profession, diversity continues to be a top priority. Creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce is mission critical, and leaders â€“ myself included â€“ need to prioritize tangible solutions that create more opportunities for diverse talent to enter and succeed in our profession. A more balanced workforce ultimately leads to an improved culture and more profitable business. Today, KPMG US launched its 2023 Impact Report sharing the many strides weâ€™ve made as a firm and practice in support of our people and planet. The report is one more great example of our commitment to diversity, transparency, culture, sustainable practices and our principles. In Tax specifically, one tangible example of our commitment to diversity is our recently launched Tax Scholarship Program. The program is designed to enable individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to further their studies at a school of their choice and grants up to $40K in funding to eligible students, giving them access to the vast KPMG Tax network, including mentors, coaches, internship opportunities and more.
Below are just a few more examples of ways KPMG is working to expand our diversity, as outlined in the report: - Rehires have increased year over year, especially for those from underrepresented backgrounds - 49% of new hires identify as part of an underrepresented racial/ethnic group - Over two-thirds of our FY23 promotion class are from underrepresented backgrounds. To learn more about how a continued investment in our people has been fundamental to our success as a firm, I hope you'll read through this latest Impact Report.

"I asked a generative AI program to write a LinkedIn post about a current tech policy trend. As you can see, AI won't be ascending to the throne of thought leader anytime soon; the post is primarily a fluffed regurgitation of facts. Not bad for some surface-level online engagement, but does it have any unique, thought-provoking perspective? Is it *saying* anything, or is it just *reciting*?
In its current state, generative AI should be considered a tool, not a one-stop shop. These tools could be useful for trend analysis or background research, which can then be incorporated into an individual's own thought leadership. But as companies start rolling out new uses for AI in their business, remember the one thing we all have that this tech doesnâ€™t: our own unique voice.
There are estimates saying generative AI could become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, so this is definitely an area to keep a very close eye on.

"Thank you to the Yahoo Finance Closing Bell team for having me on the show last week! It was great to chat about the latest jobs report, how those numbers are impacting the talent market, and the ways that companies are reconceptualizing their workforce strategies. One of those ways is explored further in RGP's research on the Dynamic Workforce model, in which companies are moving toward a 50-50 split of internal talent and skilled outsiders to create significant competitive business advantages. This approach has gained popularity among companies as they take on more transformation initiatives, such as digitization efforts and technology transformations. https://lnkd.in/gcrhHKtp hashtag#JobsReport hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#DareToWorkDifferently",Workforce strategy
"Job growth slowed in October, as U.S. employers added 150,000 jobs this past month. The latest figures point to continued labor market normalization, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the skills gap has narrowed for employers.
Large global companies are taking on an average of 20 transformation initiatives this year alone and 4 in 10 leaders we polled said they didnâ€™t have enough talent to staff these efforts last year. More employers are addressing the skills gap by embracing a workforce strategy that blends internal and outside talent, and our research tells us that that balance is nearing a 50-50 split across industries.

"The latest jobs report shows that 209,000 jobs were added in June â€“ the lowest monthly gain since a dip in December 2020. While there is a slight cool taking place in the market, the U.S. economy has still added approximately 1.67 million jobs in the first half of the year.
Talent is still in the driver's seat and that hasnâ€™t changed, as the number of quits rose above 4 million in May for the first time since last December. Workers are opting to center their careers around themselves, focusing on flexibility and autonomy. This in turn is forcing employers to think more creatively about workforce strategies and skills acquisition.

"Employers added a better-than-expected 253,000 jobs in April, but the revisions of gains from March and February â€“ totaling 149,000 jobs â€“ illustrate a labor market that is strong but moderating. There remain about 1.6 jobs for each available worker.
Given recent mass layoff announcements, the report today may seem somewhat contradictory. The reality is that remote and hybrid work has forever changed the rules, timing, place and pace of work, and caused many organizations to realign their workforce strategies. Industry group Staffing Industry Analysts expects the use of contingent workers in workforce composition to increase from 21% today to nearly 30% over the next 10 years. Our own research supports this trend, as we found that outside talent makes up 45% of critical project teams today and is expected to grow to 48% by 2024.

Mindfulness and Mindful interactions
As I have observed, the pandemic has left us with many learnings and some new habits! The habit that has formed and its permissibility seems widely accepted â€“ is that we can multi task during meetings and interactions, especially those that are screen based - remote, virtual, or hybrid.
The multi tasking habit or sickness, is where our eyes (and our mind) no longer needs to be attending to the colleague or guest we have in a given meeting or interaction
Do you all see that?
I see that a lot and I have made a personal decision to not subscribe to it!
Pre â€“ Pandemic, our meetings were predominantly physical, and we were taking notes, watching the presentation, making eye contact, etc. Today, I find that in many meetings, multi tasking by way of reviewing another screen has become table stakes. Permissible.
Mindfulness is a much larger topic and quality of meetings, plenty has been said about it!
Yet, (limiting my comments to the workplace), giving undivided attention or at least making every effort to do so â€“ has to be table stakes.
During video meetings, it is blatantly clear when the other party is not giving full attention. Roving eyes, tilted views of the head to view multiple screens, etc. I have recently observed this even during candidate interviews, which my career lessons speak to sacrosanct focus as table stakes!
If we are aware of this and no longer bothered by it, therein lies the assumed permissibility and personally, I am not subscribing to!
If I am an invitee or attendee, I am sticking to the full immersion rule..
If I am the meeting organizer, as I say to my teams : I am ready to have as long or as short of a meeting, as is supported by our mutually focused and undistracted engagement with each other.
When we are primed for a mindset of total immersion, it is no longer difficult to give our undivided attention during interactions.
The loss of productivity and creativity is real, yet not easily measured.
Wishing you all mindful interactions most of the time, noâ€¦ all the timeðŸ˜Š

"Capacity issues in healthcare, compounded by staff shortages and heavy workloads, remain critical.. We need to harness real-time data and algorithms for better triaging and care optimisation.
As highlighted in this great article by Bayer | Pharmaceuticals, Huma has already demonstrated how digital tools can ease healthcare pressures and enhance patient outcomes. It's time we boost these advancements with #ai / #genai and here are some critical questions we are contemplating and addressing at Huma:
â“ Is it possible to automate administrative and operational processes, thereby granting HCPs more time to focus on their primary role and what they do best - delivering patient care. And could these advancements morph a nurse into a ""super nurse"", extending their reach, enhancing their efficiency and capacity..?
â“ For patients, can we develop a mechanism to automate disease pathway navigation, which is not only personalised but also empathetic, functioning as a co-pilot? Empowered and engaged patient = better clinical outcomes
â“ Can we use clinically validated / regulatory approved algorithms capable of detecting and quantifying disease processes? This will enable both, better self management by patients, and delivery proactive / preventative care by providers.
Indeed the answers are positive, however, it is paramount that these are implemented in an ethical and safe manner within the critical realm of health care. Cross-sectoral collaboration will be the key to unlocking this immense potential.

"How are you supporting Learning & Development initiatives across your organization? A recent Harvard Business Review article shares five ways companies are advancing their upskilling efforts and underscores how fast the space is evolving. Two elements are driving the need for doubling down on reskilling and upskilling:
ðŸ’¡ Cultivate today's talent for tomorrow, and you have a competitive edge.
We're in an era of #digitaltransformation, and this is where upskilling can significantly impact us. Digital competency is playing out in all parts of Johnson & Johnson â€“ from #AI and #ML to enhance clinical enrollment speeds to finance to our own human resources team. Regardless of industry, leveraging learning and development tools right now to build digital acumen will only set us up for future successes.
ðŸ’¡ Personalization is the future of corporate learning.
A tailored learning approach centers around supporting your employees' unique backgrounds, abilities and needs. It's also about providing a flexible environment where employees can grow at their own pace, ignite a passion for continuous learning and stay competitive while pursuing the purpose-driven career they envision, which is what we strive to accomplish through our AI-powered platform J&J Learn.
Let's talk about it â€“ what critical skills are you seeing a growing need for?",Workforce strategy

"We are hearing that the terms #ESG #sustainability and #DEI are going underground at U.S. based companies that are on the defensive in reaction to attacks from the right. And yet, 70% of U.S. chief executives said that their companyâ€™s ESG programs improve their financial performance, up from 37% a year earlier,â€ according to a KPMG survey published in The Wall Street Journal this week.
Furthermore, in a new Harvard Business Review article, Robert Eccles and Alison Taylor argue that, ""the CSO should be involved in strategy and capital allocation; be more focused on and realistic about stakeholder interactions; be more fully engaged with investors; and be supported with sufficient sustainability resources and expertise throughout the entire organization, including on the board and senior leadership team.""
My new book, ""A Better World, Inc.: Corporate Governance for an Inclusive, Sustainable, and Prosperous Future"" (Palgrave Macmillan, July 2023) makes the business case for companies to find innovative solutions to social, economic, and environmental challenges, while centering inclusion and equity.
So while companies seek to avoid being targets of right wing backlash, responsible officers and directors will continue to understand that focus on ESG and DEI is fundamental to growing company value and profits.",Workforce strategy

"Amazon today announced the completion of their acquisition of One Medical weeks after CVS Health announced the acquisition of Oak Street Health.
These deals have the potential to be transformative for the healthcare industry and for patientsâ€”and both companies have world-class operating executives in place to shepherd the acquisitions in Amir Dan Rubin and Amar A. Desai, MD, MPH.
That said, the history of big publicly-traded companies owning health care delivery has been mixedâ€”at best.
In order for these deals to live of to their potential, both corporations will need to commit to something that is often unnatural in publicly-traded companies.
Namely, a distinctive operating culture within the context of a much broader organization whose products and services are largely unlike.
Some key imperatives:
Avoid the temptation for corporate conformity: no one likes to hear this, but healthcare delivery is different. HR process, compliance requirements, financial managementâ€”all require a different lens. Big companies who do similar sounding and related but fundamentally different things (health insurance v health care delivery; pharmacy v primary care) tend to demand and expect homogeneity, sometimes to the detriment of the acquired entity.
Remember that in healthcare delivery, patients always have to come before profit: this isnâ€™t corporate pablum but the most fundamental tenet of healthcare delivery. Organizations lose the hearts and minds of the front line (where the true value is created) when short-term thinking mortgages the long-term prospects. Scarcity of resources and the drive towards earnings can lead to anti-patient activities that erode morale and destroy long-term value.
Focus on talent retention: in clinical companies, the product is the clinician-patient relationships. Big companies tend to treat frontline workers like they are interchangeable parts. This is a losing strategy in healthcare where the patientâ€™s allegiance to the doctor trumps their allegiance to the company, the health system, pharmacy, or the health insurer.
Remember to be relentless in connecting the dots: these deals were built on the premise that 1+1 could equal 3. Amazon could potentially connect its Prime services with its primary care capabilities. CVS its pharmacy with its primary care. These connection points represent the innovation promise of these deals. But because of the silos that exist in large corporations, these are often the opportunities that get shelved most quickly. Corporate politics and fiefdoms get in the way of true value creation.
Leadership from the top will matter a lot. The tendency to tell leaders to â€œfigure it outâ€ wonâ€™t be enough. There will need to be clear direction from the CEOs of both corporationsâ€”Andy Jassy and Karen S. Lynchâ€”and the kind of upfront problem-solving that happens far too rarely in big corporations.
Time will tell if they can get it right. I sincerely hope they do.",Workforce strategy
"Layoffs in healthcare service delivery organizations are often quite problematic.
While organizations need to rightsize their cost structure or transform or modernize their operations, I have often seen organizations that provide care to patients lay off clinical staff without regard to the clinical needs or obligations that they have to their patients.
A specific savings target becomes a blind fixation that overtakes even a passing analysis of the staffing levels to meet even basic service levels.
Cut first, think later.
As healthcare organizations facing a sea of red numbers go through a period of contractionâ€”maybe even necessary contractionâ€”a cautionary reminder to think about the patients at every turn.
Itâ€™s easy to forget why we are hereâ€”and hint: itâ€™s not just to make our numbers.",Workforce strategy
"The uncertainty in the economy and increasing layoffs is shifting the balance of power in corporate America.
The way I see it, thereâ€™s no greater time for companies to invest more in their workforce and that includes making investments to help employees improve their health and wellbeing. Prioritizing these investments demonstrates to employees that a company supports its people.
The Wall Street Journal explores these new trends in workplace dynamics here:

"Layoffs can conversely lead to resignations in a workforce. The question is, why?
Layoffs can create an atmosphere of stress and anxiety in the workplace. Employees, if not reassured, constantly worry they may be next. Doing nothing to assuage fears can degrade trust in management, leading to employees quitting because they feel unsupported by their work environment.
Employers should ask themselves â€“ am I doing enough to maintain trust and nurture talent?
This New York Times piece explores this idea further. One thing is for certain â€“ leaders need to be actively listening to their employees right now.",Workforce strategy
"Layoffs are among the most challenging life experiences. One study notes it can cause as much psychological stress as a divorce. For remote workers, layoffs can be especially isolating and destabilizing.
People are the most important part of any company, but as the economy shifts and companies are forced to make difficult workforce decisions, itâ€™s the responsibility of the company to help their employees navigate this challenging process.
We can learn something from Nokiaâ€™s people-first strategy during its 2011 restructuring. At the time, it gave advance notice to affected personnel by offering multiple pathways for employees, like helping them find new roles internally, start their own business or start educational programs.
As hard as layoffs are, employers must respect their employees and the work they have contributed. Let us lead with humanity in these tough moments.

"It's the era of the employeeâ€”where companies will be measured not only by their performance, but also by how well they treat their people.

âž¡ Offering robust severance packages
