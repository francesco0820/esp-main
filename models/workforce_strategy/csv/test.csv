"Earlier this week, my family acknowledged the 30th anniversary of the untimely death of my visionary aunt, Dr. Shanti Jain.
When I was 12 years old, I quietly watched Shanti Auntie take her last breaths. We shared a train cabin as we traversed the deserts of Rajasthan, India. She awakened in the middle of the night gasping for air, struggling. My parents awakened alongside her and searched for help, for a tank of oxygen. Abruptly, the gasping stopped. I called out to ask if she was okay. ""Is she dead?"" I asked innocently. There was no response. Brief sobs and then quiet. The train rolled on in the darkness.
Before writing these words, I had not shared the experience of witnessing my aunt's death. Death is one of those subjects that is almost always fumbled. If we discuss it at length, we run the risk of dwelling on a moment beyond its useful life. If we maintain our silence, the accompanying loss can haunt us for a lifetime. There were many remarkable things about the moments leading up to and following my aunt's death.
Perhaps most personally impactful was my aunt's decisive role in establishing my career path. As we waited to board the train, my aunt, carrying the burden of a new diagnosis of stage IV ovarian cancer, asked me if I would become a doctor, like her. I told her I wasn't sure. Sitting in the wheelchair loaded with chemotherapy, I could not deny her. I promised her that I would. And while I fought my promise in the years following--I always returned to it--until it was fulfilled""with her as my inspiration.
The bitterly ironic circumstances of my aunt's death still confound me. Shanti Auntie had spent most of her life fighting to give rural populations access to health care. When it mattered most, she lacked access to good health care herself. The symptoms of her ovarian cancer, a notoriously insidious killer, were misdiagnosed over and over again. By the time she had the definitive imaging, her CT scan was alight with cancer.
Perhaps most remarkable--and most heartening--was the response of the family and friends who cared about her most. My aunt was not a famous doctor by any stretch of the imagination. Yet she was a giant in the lives of people who were touched by her grace and big personality. After her death, her brothers and sisters resolved to make her life--and death""count. One by one, they took up the causes that mattered to her most. In the years following her loss, we have collectively worked to improve health care in the small villages (Phalodi and Khichan) where she lived and served. And my own career, inspired by her example, has focused on making healthcare just a bit better.
Ryan Holiday has written that the ""obstacle is the way.""
That which obstructs our progress.
That which stands in our way can also propel us forward.
Coping with loss is never easy, but it is in managing through it that we can find the future and sometimes, even, ourselves.",MISC

"Capacity issues in healthcare, compounded by staff shortages and heavy workloads, remain critical.. We need to harness real-time data and algorithms for better triaging and care optimisation.
As highlighted in this great article by Bayer | Pharmaceuticals, Huma has already demonstrated how digital tools can ease healthcare pressures and enhance patient outcomes. It's time we boost these advancements with #ai / #genai and here are some critical questions we are contemplating and addressing at Huma:
a Is it possible to automate administrative and operational processes, thereby granting HCPs more time to focus on their primary role and what they do best - delivering patient care. And could these advancements morph a nurse into a ""super nurse"", extending their reach, enhancing their efficiency and capacity..?
a For patients, can we develop a mechanism to automate disease pathway navigation, which is not only personalised but also empathetic, functioning as a co-pilot? Empowered and engaged patient = better clinical outcomes
a Can we use clinically validated / regulatory approved algorithms capable of detecting and quantifying disease processes? This will enable both, better self management by patients, and delivery proactive / preventative care by providers.
Indeed the answers are positive, however, it is paramount that these are implemented in an ethical and safe manner within the critical realm of health care. Cross-sectoral collaboration will be the key to unlocking this immense potential.

"Normally, a better-than-expected jobs report is great news for commercial real estate demand. The news of 500,000 plus job additions in January, as well as record-low unemployment rates, should be no exception as far as long-term property fundamentals are concerned. However, this may prompt the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rate hikes for longer. Nonetheless, investors should keep two factors in mind:
1) The jobs report showed strength in lower-paying employment categories.
2) The effects of past interest rate hikes have yet to show up in slowing economic activity fully.
Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the Fed tightening cycle should be nearing its end in the coming months. For more information on January job growth and its potential impact on CRE, see the link below for our research department's latest perspective. #commercialrealestate #jobs

"The latest jobs report shows that 209,000 jobs were added in June "" the lowest monthly gain since a dip in December 2020. While there is a slight cool taking place in the market, the U.S. economy has still added approximately 1.67 million jobs in the first half of the year.
Talent is still in the driver's seat and that hasn't changed, as the number of quits rose above 4 million in May for the first time since last December.

"One of my coolest experiences so far this year has been meeting and hugging Jewel (Thank you, AHIP!). Her new Metaverse venture, Innerworld, is an amazing virtual reality-based wellness center where people can use an anonymous avatar to access free mental health tools in a safe space. Increasing accessibility is key! Y
The concept of an anonymous safe space in which to share explore and learn is fascinating and perhaps opens a new paradigm in treating mental health conditions. Being able to stay anonymous reduces the barrier to entry for a lot of folks. It has helped many seek therapy and feel more comfortable talking to someone. Truly an amazing mind-blowing idea. Plus, meeting and hearing Jewel's raw personal story around her own mental health issues, panic attacks, and anxiety was both humbling and inspiring.
While we've made a lot of progress when it comes to treating #MentalHealth, there remains a great deal of stigma. Jewel's work with Innerworld is just one part of getting to a future where mental health conditions are treated no different than physical diseases like diabetes or hypertension. Mental health IS health! Our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can absolutely positively and negatively affect our biological functioning. In other words, our minds can affect how healthy our bodies are it's so important we take care of both.

"Happy Holidays from the ESG Initiative at the Wharton School team! Join us in reflecting on this year with a note from our Vice Dean, Witold Henisz:
""As 2022 comes to a close, I'm reflecting on this year in ESG, at The Wharton School and beyond. In our July 1 launch we set out to harness the power of our faculty, alumni, students, and stakeholders to respond to the demands from ESG integrators with new research, trainings for future and current practitioners, and practical and policy insights in a manner that aligns with the evolving external environment - and we've done just that.
Starting next year Wharton undergraduates will be able to concentrate in ESG and Wharton MBAs will be able to major in ESG. Earlier this month I spoke with The New York Times about the business case for our new ESG courses and concentrations; it's not because we're driving an ideological agenda, it's because ESG is just good economics.
Just last week, Wharton Executive Education launched a first of its kind collection of ESG Certificates.
