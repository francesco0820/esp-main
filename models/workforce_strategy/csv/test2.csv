It was an honor to join Human Resource Executive of the year, Cheryl (Johnson) King, and other leading voices in the field, Diane Gherson and Tracy Keogh, at this year's Human Resources Policy Institute fall meeting to add my perspective to the ongoing conversation: Y Enterprise-wide approaches will advance AI adoption and innovation.
New use cases for AI within human resources continue to emerge as the technology improves. By employing a mix of predictive and generative AI tools and platforms, we are continuing to see improvement in high-value areas, including recruitment and learning and development. Y People will continue to be at the center. For artificial intelligence to succeed, we still need humans to ask the right questions, collect the right data and train the algorithms to protect against bias and inaccuracies. We keep ""humans in the middle"" to hold our models accountable. Y AI has the power to bring the ""HR of the Future"" to life. Our HR digital roadmap keeps the business value created in mind.

"AI regulation is clearly coming. The EU already has multiple drafts in process. And it is one of very few topics Democrats and Republicans can agree upon. The challenge of course is that no one can clearly articulate what the regulations should achieve, let alone what rules could enable or prevent those outcomes.
In an effort to embrace the reality and try to shape the debate, OpenAI gave testimony in the Senate last week and just issued a blog post advocating for an international agency similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency. I am glad they and the tech industry more broadly are leaning in.
From a politics perspective, this was a smart move and made last week's hearing much friendlier than it could have been. From a policy perspective, it is hard to tell yet. The proposal acknowledges the global nature of the risks and the issues. Today's blog post provided more detail, including distinctions between smaller open source models and experiments vs large models. Given the pace of progress on open source, it is not clear how meaningful this distinction is or will remain. But OpenAI's proposal is certainly better than some more specific suggestions like assigning punitive liability to hosting companies or requiring regulatory review of every code release or individual attributes of models - or defaulting to forcing everything through a privacy regulatory lens, which while very important for social media may not be a top three regulatory issue for AI.
I personally think the most productive regulatory effort would actually be to clarify where and how existing laws apply. For example, what does copyright mean in the context of AI? Does Drake have rights to an AI model trained on his songs? What constitutes fair use? How about privacy and data security laws? Non-discrimination laws ? Product safety regulations and product liability rules? Reducing uncertainty in the application of existing laws and regulations could go a long way toward producing fair outcomes and retaining trust in the ability of political and legal systems to keep up with rapid technological change.",Regulation/Legislation

"Normally, a better-than-expected jobs report is great news for commercial real estate demand. The news of 500,000 plus job additions in January, as well as record-low unemployment rates, should be no exception as far as long-term property fundamentals are concerned. However, this may prompt the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rate hikes for longer. Nonetheless, investors should keep two factors in mind:
1) The jobs report showed strength in lower-paying employment categories.
2) The effects of past interest rate hikes have yet to show up in slowing economic activity fully.
Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the Fed tightening cycle should be nearing its end in the coming months. For more information on January job growth and its potential impact on CRE, see the link below for our research department's latest perspective. #commercialrealestate #jobs
